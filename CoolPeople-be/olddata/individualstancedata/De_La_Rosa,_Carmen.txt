New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. As an Assembly Member, she is driven by the needs of our people.  She led the passage of the NYS Dream Act to provide access to education to all students regardless of immigration status, and worked with organizers and advocates to reshape the lives of tenants, delivering real rent reform. Carmen is the lead sponsor in the Assembly for a billionaires tax to #TaxTheRich that will ensure the ultrawealthy finally pay their fair share and help us close budget gaps wreaked by COVID-19. Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect  frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses. Carmen De La Rosa is the leader this moment requires. vulnerable  About District 10 District 10 is home to the vibrant communities of Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill. Since the 1900s, these neighborhoods have been the homes of immigrant communities such as Cubans, German Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans and now Dominicans who are the primary immigrant group.  Uptown Manhattan is home to the highest number of Dominicans of any neighborhood in the United States who account for nearly 100,000 of the residents. This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers.

This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers. The history of the district, however, is tainted with inequities and exclusion in government. Gentrification threatens the very fabric of the community as long-time residents are pushed out for newer, wealthier ones. Small businesses, too, find it increasingly difficult to survive with rising rents.  When COVID-19 hit, our district one of the hardest hit in the city—highlighting just how much essential workers sacrifice to keep our city running. The next 10 years will be pivotal for our district: we must stop gentrification and build a city that is centered around the needs of the working class.

This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers. The history of the district, however, is tainted with inequities and exclusion in government. Gentrification threatens the very fabric of the community as long-time residents are pushed out for newer, wealthier ones. Small businesses, too, find it increasingly difficult to survive with rising rents.  When COVID-19 hit, our district one of the hardest hit in the city—highlighting just how much essential workers sacrifice to keep our city running. The next 10 years will be pivotal for our district: we must stop gentrification and build a city that is centered around the needs of the working class. Let’s build truly affordable housing, fund public schools, and support services that will help our community thrive. The structure of power in our community will change on June 22nd, 2021.

English BIOGRAFIA PLATAFORMA    VOLUNTEER Conoce a Carmen De La Rosa Conoce a Carmen De La Rosa Carmen De La Rosa emigró de República Dominicana cuando era niña y creció en Inwood, donde ha vivido toda su vida. Su defensa y pasión por la justicia están profundamente influenciadas por sus raíces. Ha escuchado y defendido a los más vulnerables, incluso antes de comenzar su carrera en el gobierno. En noviembre de 2016, Carmen fue elegida para representarnos en la Asamblea del Estado de Nueva York. Desde su primer día en el cargo, Carmen ha luchado contra el racismo, la xenofobia y la injusticia económica y su compromiso con la comunidad que ama continúa. Como asambleísta, ella está impulsada por las necesidades de nuestra gente. Lideró la aprobación de la NYS Dream Act para brindar acceso a la educación a todos los estudiantes independientemente de su estatus migratorio, y trabajó con organizadores y defensores para remodelar la vida de los inquilinos, logrando una verdadera reforma del alquiler. Carmen es la patrocinadora principal en la Asamblea de un impuesto a los multimillonarios,#TaxTheRich, que garantizará que los ultrarricos finalmente paguen su parte justa y nos ayudará a cerrar las brechas presupuestarias causadas por COVID-19. Carmen luchará para asegurarse de que las necesidades de nuestra comunidad estén a la vanguardia . Ella luchará para proteger a nuestra comunidad del desarrollo irresponsable y el desplazamiento, desmantelará fallas fundamentales en nuestro sistema de justicia penal, expandirá nuestras redes de seguridad social, arreglará nuestro sistema educativo roto y protegerá a los trabajadores de primera línea y las pequeñas empresas vulnerables. Carmen De La Rosa es la líder que requiere este momento. Sobre el Distrito 10 El Distrito 10 es el hogar de las vibrantes comunidades de Washington Heights, Inwood y Marble Hill. Desde la década de 1900, estos vecindarios han sido el hogar de comunidades de inmigrantes como cubanos, judíos alemanes, rusos, puertorriqueños y ahora dominicanos que son el principal grupo de inmigrantes. Uptown Manhattan es el hogar de la mayor cantidad de dominicanos de cualquier vecindario en los Estados Unidos que representan casi 100,000 de los residentes. Esto le ha valido a Uptown el apodo de Pequeña República Dominicana. El distrito es el hogar de muchas personas mayores, familias de clase trabajadora y trabajadores esenciales. Sin embargo, la historia del distrito está teñida de inequidades y exclusión en el gobierno. La gentrificación amenaza el tejido mismo de la comunidad a medida que los residentes antiguos son empujados por otros más nuevos y ricos. También a las pequeñas empresas les resulta cada vez más difícil sobrevivir con el aumento de los alquileres. Cuando llegó el COVID-19, nuestro distrito fue uno de los más afectados de la ciudad, destacando cuánto se sacrifican los trabajadores esenciales para mantener nuestra ciudad en funcionamiento. Los próximos 10 años serán fundamentales para nuestro distrito: debemos detener la gentrificación y construir una ciudad que se centre en las necesidades de la clase trabajadora. Construyamos viviendas verdaderamente asequibles, financiemos escuelas públicas y servicios de apoyo que ayudarán a nuestra comunidad a prosperar. La estructura de poder en nuestra comunidad cambiará el 22 de junio de 2021. Asegúrese de que su voz sea escuchada. Haga clic aquí para registrarse para votar. El Plan de Carmen Carmen De La Rosa ha utilizado su voz y su plataforma para exigir una reforma de la justicia penal, el fortalecimiento de las leyes de estabilización de alquileres que protegen y priorizan a los inquilinos de bajos ingresos, defendió firmemente los derechos y la igualdad de las mujeres y ha sido una voz líder en el desarrollo de políticas. en torno a los servicios de salud mental para las comunidades minoritarias y la prevención del suicidio.
