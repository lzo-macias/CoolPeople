Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that ANTHONY WEINER was sentenced today in Manhattan federal court to 21 months in prison for transferring obscene material to a minor.  WEINER pled guilty on May 19, 2017, before U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska.  Today’s sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote. Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said:  “Anthony Weiner, a former Congressman and candidate for Mayor, asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behavior for him online.  Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison.  Today, Anthony Weiner received a just sentence that was appropriate for his crime.” In sentencing ANTHONY WEINER, Judge Cote said:  “This is a serious crime that deserves serious punishment.” According to the documents filed in this case and statements made in court proceedings: Between January and March 2016, WEINER used online messaging and video chat applications to communicate with a minor girl he knew to be 15 years old (the “Minor Victim”) and to transfer obscene material to her.  Those communications began the evening of January 23, 2016, when the Minor Victim initiated contact with WEINER by sending him a direct message on Twitter.  That night, the Minor Victim and WEINER exchanged a series of messages.  Early in the exchange, the Minor Victim revealed to WEINER that she was in high school.  As their communications progressed, the Minor Victim made plain that she was a minor.  Despite that knowledge, WEINER participated in increasingly suggestive exchanges.  The exchanges occurred over Facebook messenger, Skype, Kik, Confide, and Snapchat, the latter three of which are messaging and photo-sharing applications that delete messages and images once viewed. Between February 17 and 23, 2016, WEINER and the Minor Victim participated in three video chat sessions on Skype.  The Minor Victim made clear during those chat sessions that she was not just a minor; she was, in fact, only 15 years old.    Nevertheless, during the latter two Skype sessions, on February 18 and 23, 2016, and in a Snapchat communication on March 9, 2016, the defendant used graphic and obscene language to ask the Minor Victim to display her naked body and touch herself, which she did.  He also sent an obscene message to the Minor Victim on Confide, describing what he would do to her if she were 18.  As part of these criminal exchanges, the defendant also sent the Minor Victim adult pornography, or a link thereto.  In approximately March 2016, after several months of intermittent exchanges, communications between the defendant and the Minor Victim largely stopped. *                *                * In addition to the prison term, WEINER, 53, of New York, New York, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. Mr. Kim praised and thanked the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Victims Division of the New York City Police Department for their outstanding work. The case is being handled by the Office’s General Crimes Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Amanda Kramer and Stephanie Lake are in charge of the prosecution.

National Security and International Narcotics The National Security and International Narcotics Unit is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of domestic and international criminal conduct that threatens U.S. national security, including counterterrorism, counterintelligence, sanctions evasion, export control, malign foreign influence, transnational repression, and international narcotics and weapons trafficking matters. The Unit works closely with the Office’s federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the New York City Police Department, as well as components across the U.S. Intelligence Community. Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force investigates and prosecutes crimes relating to the operation of the country’s securities and commodities markets and to fraud on both individual and institutional investors, including all varieties of securities fraud, insider trading, market manipulation schemes, accounting and regulatory reporting frauds, and Ponzi schemes and other investor frauds.  The Task Force works in close coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to uncover and prosecute these financial frauds. Complex Frauds and Cybercrime The Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of some of the most sophisticated fraud and cyber cases in the country, many of which are international in scope.  The Unit’s fraud cases involve individual and corporate defendants across a wide range of subject areas, including health care fraud, consumer fraud, tax fraud, investment fraud, government contracting fraud, bankruptcy fraud, COVID-19 pandemic fraud, corporate malfeasance, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations.  The Unit’s cyber cases involve national security investigations targeting nation-state and nation-state-sponsored actors, cryptocurrency hacks and scams, ransomware, darknet markets, and computer intrusions targeting stolen credentials, financial information, and confidential business information and technology.  The Unit works closely with multiple law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Health & Human Services-OIG, and the New York City Department of Investigation, as well in coordination with other U.S. Government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division and Criminal Division. Public Corruption The Public Corruption Unit works, in close partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal, state, and city investigative agencies to maintain and protect the integrity of all levels of government. The Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of corruption crimes committed by elected and appointed officials, government employees, and individuals and companies doing business with the city, state, and federal government, as well as campaign finance offenses. Corruption crimes investigated by the Unit include bribery, embezzlement, and frauds committed against local, state, and federal government agencies. Illicit Finance and Money Laundering The Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit aggressively pursues criminal actors, networks, and entities that threaten the integrity of the U.S. financial system through exploiting U.S. financial institutions, broadly defined to include traditional banks as well as formal and informal money transmitters, fintech companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and broker-dealers.  In pursuit of this mission, the Unit focuses on three key areas, each of which implicate significant illicit financial threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing the United States financial system: (1) Bank Secrecy Act violations; (2) sanctions enforcement; and (3) large-scale international money laundering networks.  The supervisors and staff assigned to the Unit also oversee the Office’s forfeiture program, including forfeiture actions and allegations filed in cases across the Criminal Division. In that capacity, the Unit has also pioneered the use of federal forfeiture laws to recover and return stolen art and cultural heritage property. Violent and Organized Crime The Violent and Organized Crime Unit investigates and prosecutes violent and sophisticated criminal organizations based in New York City and around the world.  By aggressively using the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, cooperating witnesses, and other investigative techniques, the Unit has successfully prosecuted countless leaders and members of notorious criminal enterprises, including nationwide violent gangs like the Bloods, Crips, and Latin Kings; neighborhood-based crews responsible for, among other things, shootings, robberies, drug trafficking, and fraud; La Cosa Nostra, or the Italian mafia; Eastern European and Eurasian criminal enterprises; and Asian and African organized crime.  The Unit is dedicated to bringing cases that will have a tangible impact on public safety in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, helping dismantle violent gangs and reduce gun violence in residential neighborhoods.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes unsolved or “cold case” murders, illegal firearms trafficking, labor union corruption, and other racketeering offenses committed by criminal enterprises, including alien smuggling and sophisticated frauds. Narcotics The Narcotics Unit is devoted to prosecuting narcotics-related offenses harming our communities locally, nationally, and internationally.  The Unit works closely with a variety of federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Customs and Border Patrol; local law enforcement agencies, including the New York City Police Department and the New York State Police; and local-federal partnerships, including, notably, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Strike Force and New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, to investigate and prosecute narcotics traffickers fueling the opioid crisis through the distribution of fentanyl and its analogues; dealers who traffic in cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other controlled substances; and those involved in the illegal diversion and distribution prescription painkillers.  The Unit maintains a particular focus on the victims of narcotics trafficking, including both the victims of drug poisonings as well as violence perpetrated by drug trafficking organizations.  The work of the Unit has led to significant seizures of controlled substances and proceeds from criminal activity, dismantled drug trafficking organizations from neighborhood gangs to international syndicates, interrupted the flow of money enriching large-scale drug traffickers, and rendered justice for victims of drug poisonings and drug-related murders and violence. Civil Rights The Civil Rights Unit is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of all criminal civil rights offenses.  Established in 2021, the Civil Rights Unit prosecutes deprivations of constitutional rights by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who abuse their authority.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes human trafficking and sexual abuse offenses, as well as acts of violence or threats of violence that are motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  The work of the Unit also includes investigating and prosecuting the unlawful interference with reproductive health services, environmental crimes, and voting rights cases.  The Civil Rights Unit works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to advance its mission of using the criminal laws to protect civil rights. General Crimes All entry-level Assistant U.S. Attorneys (“AUSAs”) in the Criminal Division are first assigned to the General Crimes Unit, where they learn the various aspects of federal criminal prosecution and handle cases covering a range of subject matter, including violence and fraud.  In the Unit, AUSAs learn how to investigate, bring to trial, and handle appeals for criminal cases.  AUSAs in the Unit also handle the daily intake of cases referred to the Office by virtually every law enforcement agency within the District.  AUSAs are assigned to the various subject-specific senior units within the Office after their time in General Crimes. Appeals The Criminal Appeals Unit provides support to the Office by ensuring that submissions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are of the highest quality.  The Unit assists with writing briefs and motions and preparing Criminal Division AUSAs for oral arguments before the Second Circuit.  The Unit also provides guidance on legal issues arising in all phases of criminal prosecutions, advises the Office of developments in criminal law, and assists in the formulation of Office policies that address enforcement of that law.

Complex Frauds and Cybercrime The Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of some of the most sophisticated fraud and cyber cases in the country, many of which are international in scope.  The Unit’s fraud cases involve individual and corporate defendants across a wide range of subject areas, including health care fraud, consumer fraud, tax fraud, investment fraud, government contracting fraud, bankruptcy fraud, COVID-19 pandemic fraud, corporate malfeasance, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations.  The Unit’s cyber cases involve national security investigations targeting nation-state and nation-state-sponsored actors, cryptocurrency hacks and scams, ransomware, darknet markets, and computer intrusions targeting stolen credentials, financial information, and confidential business information and technology.  The Unit works closely with multiple law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Health & Human Services-OIG, and the New York City Department of Investigation, as well in coordination with other U.S. Government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division and Criminal Division. Public Corruption The Public Corruption Unit works, in close partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal, state, and city investigative agencies to maintain and protect the integrity of all levels of government. The Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of corruption crimes committed by elected and appointed officials, government employees, and individuals and companies doing business with the city, state, and federal government, as well as campaign finance offenses. Corruption crimes investigated by the Unit include bribery, embezzlement, and frauds committed against local, state, and federal government agencies. Illicit Finance and Money Laundering The Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit aggressively pursues criminal actors, networks, and entities that threaten the integrity of the U.S. financial system through exploiting U.S. financial institutions, broadly defined to include traditional banks as well as formal and informal money transmitters, fintech companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and broker-dealers.  In pursuit of this mission, the Unit focuses on three key areas, each of which implicate significant illicit financial threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing the United States financial system: (1) Bank Secrecy Act violations; (2) sanctions enforcement; and (3) large-scale international money laundering networks.  The supervisors and staff assigned to the Unit also oversee the Office’s forfeiture program, including forfeiture actions and allegations filed in cases across the Criminal Division. In that capacity, the Unit has also pioneered the use of federal forfeiture laws to recover and return stolen art and cultural heritage property. Violent and Organized Crime The Violent and Organized Crime Unit investigates and prosecutes violent and sophisticated criminal organizations based in New York City and around the world.  By aggressively using the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, cooperating witnesses, and other investigative techniques, the Unit has successfully prosecuted countless leaders and members of notorious criminal enterprises, including nationwide violent gangs like the Bloods, Crips, and Latin Kings; neighborhood-based crews responsible for, among other things, shootings, robberies, drug trafficking, and fraud; La Cosa Nostra, or the Italian mafia; Eastern European and Eurasian criminal enterprises; and Asian and African organized crime.  The Unit is dedicated to bringing cases that will have a tangible impact on public safety in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, helping dismantle violent gangs and reduce gun violence in residential neighborhoods.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes unsolved or “cold case” murders, illegal firearms trafficking, labor union corruption, and other racketeering offenses committed by criminal enterprises, including alien smuggling and sophisticated frauds. Narcotics The Narcotics Unit is devoted to prosecuting narcotics-related offenses harming our communities locally, nationally, and internationally.  The Unit works closely with a variety of federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Customs and Border Patrol; local law enforcement agencies, including the New York City Police Department and the New York State Police; and local-federal partnerships, including, notably, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Strike Force and New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, to investigate and prosecute narcotics traffickers fueling the opioid crisis through the distribution of fentanyl and its analogues; dealers who traffic in cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other controlled substances; and those involved in the illegal diversion and distribution prescription painkillers.  The Unit maintains a particular focus on the victims of narcotics trafficking, including both the victims of drug poisonings as well as violence perpetrated by drug trafficking organizations.  The work of the Unit has led to significant seizures of controlled substances and proceeds from criminal activity, dismantled drug trafficking organizations from neighborhood gangs to international syndicates, interrupted the flow of money enriching large-scale drug traffickers, and rendered justice for victims of drug poisonings and drug-related murders and violence. Civil Rights The Civil Rights Unit is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of all criminal civil rights offenses.  Established in 2021, the Civil Rights Unit prosecutes deprivations of constitutional rights by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who abuse their authority.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes human trafficking and sexual abuse offenses, as well as acts of violence or threats of violence that are motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  The work of the Unit also includes investigating and prosecuting the unlawful interference with reproductive health services, environmental crimes, and voting rights cases.  The Civil Rights Unit works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to advance its mission of using the criminal laws to protect civil rights. General Crimes All entry-level Assistant U.S. Attorneys (“AUSAs”) in the Criminal Division are first assigned to the General Crimes Unit, where they learn the various aspects of federal criminal prosecution and handle cases covering a range of subject matter, including violence and fraud.  In the Unit, AUSAs learn how to investigate, bring to trial, and handle appeals for criminal cases.  AUSAs in the Unit also handle the daily intake of cases referred to the Office by virtually every law enforcement agency within the District.  AUSAs are assigned to the various subject-specific senior units within the Office after their time in General Crimes. Appeals The Criminal Appeals Unit provides support to the Office by ensuring that submissions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are of the highest quality.  The Unit assists with writing briefs and motions and preparing Criminal Division AUSAs for oral arguments before the Second Circuit.  The Unit also provides guidance on legal issues arising in all phases of criminal prosecutions, advises the Office of developments in criminal law, and assists in the formulation of Office policies that address enforcement of that law.

Below is an overview of its practice areas. Civil Frauds The Civil Frauds Unit (the “CiFU”) investigates and prosecutes large-scale and sophisticated frauds committed against the government and financial institutions in a wide array of areas, including health care fraud, financial fraud, procurement fraud, grant fraud, mortgage fraud, customs fraud, federal program fraud, and other schemes that harm the public fisc and undermine government priorities.  The CiFU’s most powerful tool is the False Claims Act, in the context of which the CiFU frequently works with whistleblowers to investigate, expose, and combat fraud and abuse of government funds — frequently obtaining substantial monetary recoveries, public admissions of misconduct from defendants, and, where appropriate, injunctive relief.  For example, in its health care fraud practice, the CiFU has brought and resolved many innovative, high-impact False Claims Act cases, including matters addressing kickbacks to medical providers, fraudulent billing, medical device fraud, fraud in the Medicare Part C program, and fraud and abuse in residential care facilities.  The CiFU also regularly partners with the Office’s Criminal Division in the area of health care fraud, including, for example in the recent prosecution and resolution of False Claims Act cases against a medical device company and an ophthalmology practice, both for fraudulent billing. The CiFU enforces the False Claims Act in many other areas as well.  For instance, the CiFU maintains a robust customs fraud practice, prosecuting schemes involving the intentional undervaluing of goods imported into the United States, the misclassification of goods under federal tariff schedules, and more.  The CiFU has also brought notable cases involving violations of the Controlled Substances Act (including the first prosecution of executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself for trafficking opioids), the fraudulent use of federal research grants and federal program funds intended to benefit underserved groups. In addition, the CIFU has a long track record of bringing important cases under the False Claims Act, the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act ("FIRREA"), and other statutes to address major financial frauds.  In particular, the CiFU brought the Department of Justice's first mortgage fraud lawsuits against major Wall Street financial institutions for engaging in reckless lending practices prior to the financial crisis, recovering over a billion dollars from those institutions.  The CiFU has continued its pursuit of sophisticated financial wrongdoing, for example bringing False Claims Act and FIRREA matters against major banks for schemes to overcharge their foreign exchange customers.  The CiFU continues to investigate fraud and abuse in new and evolving areas, including, for example, cyber fraud and fraud relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related relief programs. Environmental Protection and Public Health The Environmental Protection Unit protects the environment and public health in the Southern District of New York and beyond. Our matters include enforcement under traditional environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act , Safe Drinking Water Act , and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) ; protection of the public from lead paint and other health threats in housing ; preventing the sale of unregistered pesticide s ; and food safety . The Environmental Protection Unit also defends the United States in lawsuits under environmental, natural resources, and wildlife laws.  These matters include challenges to regulations and other formal actions by environmental agencies; claims that agencies failed to give environmental issues a “hard look” where required under the National Environmental Protection Act; and requests for courts to compel environmental agencies to take actions that they have not taken. We encourage members of the public to bring environmental concerns relating to the Southern District of New York to our attention.  If you wish to do so, please send an email to USANYS.Environmental@usdoj.gov and describe the concerns in as much detail as possible. General Defensive Litigation The Civil Division has a diverse and challenging general defensive litigation practice.  Civil Division AUSAs defend against constitutional challenges to federal statutes and regulations; suits to overturn government policies and programs; and attacks on the legality of government decisions.  Civil Division AUSAs also represent individual employees in suits brought against them for actions taken in the scope of their federal employment and represent the United States and its agencies and officers in employment discrimination and tort cases, Freedom of Information Act litigation, and many other cases. National Security and Foreign Policy The Civil Division litigates a wide range of cases implicating the national security, national defense, and foreign relations of the United States.  Civil Division AUSAs have handled cases ranging from the assertion of the foreign policy interests of the United States in federal court to defending against challenges to the activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement. The Civil Division also advises federal courts on matters implicating the immunity of foreign governments, heads of state, and the United Nations.  Civil Division AUSAs also handle litigation to protect classified national security information from disclosure, including through assertion of the state secrets privilege. Cases often arise in the context of requests for federal agency records under the Freedom of Information Act or third-party requests for discovery from agencies. Tax and Bankruptcy SDNY is one of the only U.S. Attorney’s Offices that represents the United States and its agencies in bankruptcy proceedings and civil tax litigation. The Office’s bankruptcy practice is remarkably diverse and sophisticated, as Civil Division AUSAs have represented the federal government in some of the biggest and most significant bankruptcies in United States history.  These matters include bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears and Lehman Brothers). Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including filing affirmative cases to collect millions of dollars of unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for failures to report foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases in which sophisticated corporate entities engage in transactions that lack economic substance to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to prevent abusive tax preparers and tax shelter promoters from operating. Appeals Civil Division AUSAs brief and argue all appeals from their own cases, typically in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Supervisors in the Appeals Unit works closely with the AUSAs to help prepare the briefs and oral arguments, whether the Government is appealing a judgment against it, defending a ruling in its favor, or advising the court of the Government’s views through an amicus curiae brief.  The Appeals Unit also assists the Solicitor General in preparing briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court that arise from cases handled by this Office.

Updated January 31, 2025 Civil Division Civil Division Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email The Civil Division represents the interests of the United States and its agencies in all civil litigation at trial and on appeal. Below is an overview of its practice areas. Civil Frauds The Civil Frauds Unit (the “CiFU”) investigates and prosecutes large-scale and sophisticated frauds committed against the government and financial institutions in a wide array of areas, including health care fraud, financial fraud, procurement fraud, grant fraud, mortgage fraud, customs fraud, federal program fraud, and other schemes that harm the public fisc and undermine government priorities.  The CiFU’s most powerful tool is the False Claims Act, in the context of which the CiFU frequently works with whistleblowers to investigate, expose, and combat fraud and abuse of government funds — frequently obtaining substantial monetary recoveries, public admissions of misconduct from defendants, and, where appropriate, injunctive relief.  For example, in its health care fraud practice, the CiFU has brought and resolved many innovative, high-impact False Claims Act cases, including matters addressing kickbacks to medical providers, fraudulent billing, medical device fraud, fraud in the Medicare Part C program, and fraud and abuse in residential care facilities.  The CiFU also regularly partners with the Office’s Criminal Division in the area of health care fraud, including, for example in the recent prosecution and resolution of False Claims Act cases against a medical device company and an ophthalmology practice, both for fraudulent billing. The CiFU enforces the False Claims Act in many other areas as well.  For instance, the CiFU maintains a robust customs fraud practice, prosecuting schemes involving the intentional undervaluing of goods imported into the United States, the misclassification of goods under federal tariff schedules, and more.  The CiFU has also brought notable cases involving violations of the Controlled Substances Act (including the first prosecution of executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself for trafficking opioids), the fraudulent use of federal research grants and federal program funds intended to benefit underserved groups. In addition, the CIFU has a long track record of bringing important cases under the False Claims Act, the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act ("FIRREA"), and other statutes to address major financial frauds.  In particular, the CiFU brought the Department of Justice's first mortgage fraud lawsuits against major Wall Street financial institutions for engaging in reckless lending practices prior to the financial crisis, recovering over a billion dollars from those institutions.  The CiFU has continued its pursuit of sophisticated financial wrongdoing, for example bringing False Claims Act and FIRREA matters against major banks for schemes to overcharge their foreign exchange customers.  The CiFU continues to investigate fraud and abuse in new and evolving areas, including, for example, cyber fraud and fraud relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related relief programs. Environmental Protection and Public Health The Environmental Protection Unit protects the environment and public health in the Southern District of New York and beyond. Our matters include enforcement under traditional environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act , Safe Drinking Water Act , and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) ; protection of the public from lead paint and other health threats in housing ; preventing the sale of unregistered pesticide s ; and food safety . The Environmental Protection Unit also defends the United States in lawsuits under environmental, natural resources, and wildlife laws.  These matters include challenges to regulations and other formal actions by environmental agencies; claims that agencies failed to give environmental issues a “hard look” where required under the National Environmental Protection Act; and requests for courts to compel environmental agencies to take actions that they have not taken. We encourage members of the public to bring environmental concerns relating to the Southern District of New York to our attention.  If you wish to do so, please send an email to USANYS.Environmental@usdoj.gov and describe the concerns in as much detail as possible. General Defensive Litigation The Civil Division has a diverse and challenging general defensive litigation practice.  Civil Division AUSAs defend against constitutional challenges to federal statutes and regulations; suits to overturn government policies and programs; and attacks on the legality of government decisions.  Civil Division AUSAs also represent individual employees in suits brought against them for actions taken in the scope of their federal employment and represent the United States and its agencies and officers in employment discrimination and tort cases, Freedom of Information Act litigation, and many other cases. National Security and Foreign Policy The Civil Division litigates a wide range of cases implicating the national security, national defense, and foreign relations of the United States.  Civil Division AUSAs have handled cases ranging from the assertion of the foreign policy interests of the United States in federal court to defending against challenges to the activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement. The Civil Division also advises federal courts on matters implicating the immunity of foreign governments, heads of state, and the United Nations.  Civil Division AUSAs also handle litigation to protect classified national security information from disclosure, including through assertion of the state secrets privilege. Cases often arise in the context of requests for federal agency records under the Freedom of Information Act or third-party requests for discovery from agencies.

(“Gramercy Cardiac”), alleging that he paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to physicians and their practices for patient referrals.  The kickbacks took the form of inflated office “rental payments” and fees paid to contracted cardiologists. $678 Million Anti-Kickback Statute Settlement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals for Operating Sham Speaker Programs :  In 2020, the Office reached a $678 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Novartis”), resolving claims that Novartis violated the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute by providing doctors with cash payments, recreational outings, lavish meals, and expensive alcohol to induce them to prescribe Novartis’s cardiovascular and diabetes drugs, which were then reimbursed by federal healthcare programs.  The Government alleged that Novartis organized tens of thousands of sham speaker events at high-end restaurants and other venues and paid exorbitant speaker fees to doctors who gave no meaningful presentations.  When those doctors then prescribed Novartis’s drugs, federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for these tainted prescriptions. Healthcare Fraud – Fraudulent Billing Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Medical Device Company for Creating and Selling a Fake Medical Component That Was Implanted Into Patients :  In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Stimwave LLC (“Stimwave”), a Florida-based medical device company, alleging that Stimwave created and sold a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.  Under the civil settlement, Stimwave agreed to pay $8.6 million to the United States.  Simultaneous with the resolution of the civil case, the SDNY’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit announced the filing of criminal charges against the former CEO of Stimwave for her role in the fraudulent scheme. $49 Million Settlement with Biotech Testing Company for Fraudulent Billing and Kickback Practices :  In 2020, the Office resolved claims against Progenity, Inc. (“Progenity”), a biotechnology company that provides molecular and diagnostic tests, for fraudulently billing federal healthcare programs for prenatal tests and providing kickbacks to physicians to induce them to order Progenity tests for their patients.  As alleged in the lawsuit, Progenity fraudulently used a billing code that misrepresented the tests provided and provided illegal kickbacks in the form of excessive “draw fees” to physicians, meals and happy hours for physicians and their staff, and the improper reduction or waiver of patient coinsurance and deductible payments.  Under the settlement, Progenity agreed to pay a total of $49 million to resolve various governmental claims. $40.5 Million Settlement with Durable Medical Equipment Provider for Fraudulent Billing Practices :  In 2020, Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. and its affiliate, Apria Healthcare LLC (together, “Apria”) agreed to pay a total of $40.5 million to resolve governmental claims that, among other things, Apria submitted false claims to federal healthcare programs seeking reimbursement for the rental of costly non-invasive ventilators to program beneficiaries.  As alleged, those beneficiaries were not using the non-invasive ventilators, such that the devices were not medically necessary; Apria admitted that it continued to seek reimbursement from federal programs after it had information that patients had stopped using their ventilators.  In addition, the government’s lawsuit alleged that Apria improperly waived patient co-insurance payments for the devices. Healthcare Fraud – Elder Care $7.85 Million Settlement with Skilled Nursing Facility for Fraudulently Switching Residents’ Healthcare Coverage to Boost Medicare Payments :  In 2022, the Office settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against Plaza Rehab and Nursing Center (“Plaza Rehab Center”) and Citadel Consulting Group LLC (“Citadel”), which alleged that Plaza Rehab Center, acting at the direction of Citadel, fraudulently switched the type of Medicare coverage in which elderly residents were enrolled in order to maximize the Medicare payments that Plaza Rehab Center would receive.  The residents and their families often did not request, consent to, or know about the change to their healthcare coverage, which had the potential to impact their out-of-pocket payments, the scope of the services and care covered, and their drug coverage plan.  As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $7.85 million. Settlement of Lawsuit Alleging that Bronx Nursing Home Paid Kickbacks for Patient Referrals and Switched Residents’ Healthcare Coverage Without Their Consent :  In 2023, the Office settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Morris Park Nursing Home (“Morris Park”), a skilled nursing facility located in the Bronx, New York, and individuals formerly associated with Morris Park.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes that violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The first scheme involved cash payments made to a supervisor at a nearby hospital for patient referrals, and the second scheme involved switching residents’ Medicare coverage without their consent in order to increase the Medicare payments that Morris Park received.  Under the settlements, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $3.46 million. Healthcare Fraud – Medicare Part C Fraud $37 Million Medicare Part C Fraud Settlement with Cigna :  In 2023, the Office reached a $37 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against The Cigna Group (“Cigna”) and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations.  The settlement resolved claims that Cigna submitted to the government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments it received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.  The government alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by Cigna to conduct in-home assessments of plan members, and that the healthcare providers who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported. Healthcare Fraud – Pharmaceutical Fraud $269.2 Million Recoveries in Healthcare Fraud Settlements with Walgreens :  In 2019, the Office filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens’s improper billings to government healthcare programs.  The lawsuit alleged that Walgreens improperly billed the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens sought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated prices. Violations of the Controlled Substances Act $20 Million Dollar Settlement with Rochester Drug Cooperative for Failing to Report Suspicious Orders of Controlled Substances to the DEA :  In 2019, Rochester Drug Cooperative (“RDC”), a wholesale drug distributor, agreed to pay a $20 million penalty to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Office under the Controlled Substances Act.  The complaint alleged that between May 2012 and November 2016, RDC knowingly failed to comply with its legal obligation to report thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as Oxycodone and fentanyl, despite being aware that many of its largest pharmacy customers exhibited “red flags” associated with the diversion of such drugs. The Office’s investigation also ultimately led to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with RDC and a first-of-its-kind felony conviction of RDC’s former CEO for conspiring to unlawfully distribute controlled substances and defrauding the DEA. Financial Fraud $72.6 Million Settlement of Fraud Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo Bank for Overcharging Foreign Exchange Customers :  In 2021, Wells Fargo Bank (“Wells Fargo”) agreed to pay a total of approximately $72.6 million to resolve claims brought under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, alleging that Wells Fargo fraudulently overcharged hundreds of commercial customers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses and federally-insured financial institutions, who used Wells Fargo’s foreign exchange (“FX”) service.  The suit alleged that from 2010 through 2017, Wells Fargo FX sales specialists defrauded nearly 800 customers by systematically charging them higher markups on FX transactions than they represented Wells Fargo would charge and concealing those overcharges through various misrepresentations and deceptive practices. Program and Grant Fraud Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Former Hunter College Professor and Hunter College for Fraudulently Using Federal Research Funds :  In 2023, the Office resolved claims under the False Claims Act against Jeffrey T. Parsons-Hietikko (“Parsons”), a former psychology professor at Hunter College (“Hunter”), and Hunter, for the fraudulent misuse of research grant funds provided by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”).  Parsons previously served as Director of Hunter’s Center for HIV Educational Studies (“CHEST”).  Among other things, the government’s lawsuit alleged that for years, Parsons improperly invoiced personal expenses to NIH funds, including expenses relating to scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, and a tropical birthday celebration.  The lawsuit further alleged that Hunter used NIH funds to pay Parsons tens of thousands of dollars in retention bonuses without disclosing those payments to NIH as required, and that Parsons and Hunter submitted false timekeeping records that resulted in the use of NIH grant funds to compensate CHEST staff for work performed for Parsons’s private clients.  Under the settlement, Parsons and Hunter agreed to pay $375,000 and $200,000, respectively. Settlements in Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Three Companies for False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation on Federal Construction Projects :  In 2019 and 2021 , the Office resolved claims against three companies for their roles in a scheme to make false statements about disadvantaged business participation on two federal construction projects.  Under Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, contracts for certain federally funded projects require the participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that, in connection with federally funded steel painting projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza, Ahern Painting Contractors Co. misrepresented that Tower Maintenance Corp., a certified DBE, was solely performing millions of dollars of work on the two projects.  In fact, much of that work was being performed by Spectrum Painting Corp., a non-DBE.  Under the settlements, the three defendants agreed to pay over $3.5 million. $5.3 Million Settlement of Lawsuit Against New York City for Fraudulently Obtaining FEMA Funds Following Superstorm Sandy :  In 2019, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against the City of New York (the “City”) alleging that the New York City Department of Transportation (“NYCDOT”) fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by falsely claiming that numerous NYCDOT vehicles were damaged during Superstorm Sandy.  Under the settlement, the City agreed to pay $5.3 million. Customs Fraud $22.8 Million Settlement of Customs Fraud Lawsuit Against Vitamin Importer for Underpaying Customs Duties Owed on Products Imported Into the United States :  In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil lawsuit against International Vitamins Corporation (“IVC”), a United States-based company that imports and sells vitamins and nutritional supplements from China.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that for years, IVC defrauded the United States by misclassifying more than 30 of its products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in order to avoid paying customs duties, and by failing to pay back duties owed to the United States even after IVC finally corrected its longstanding misclassifications.  Under the settlement, IVC agreed to pay $22.8 million. Settlement of Customs Fraud Suit Against Clothing Companies and Their Former CEO for Misrepresenting the Value of Goods to Avoid Paying Customs Duties :  In 2021, the Office resolved a lawsuit against Stargate Apparel, Inc., Rivstar Apparel, Inc., and Joseph Bailey (the former CEO and owner of both companies), for employing a variety of schemes to defraud the United States of millions of dollars in customs duties, by submitting invoices to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that falsely understated the true value of the clothing they imported into the United States.  Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $6 million.  This civil settlement was in addition to a $1,661,617 forfeiture amount that Bailey was ordered to pay in parallel criminal proceedings handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit. COVID-19 Related Fraud The Office has a number of ongoing investigations related to fraudulent conduct during the pandemic. With the assistance of our law enforcement partners, Civil Division AUSAs are investigating fraud related to the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program and other government relief programs that were designed to help those in financial need, as well as pandemic-related health care fraud schemes involving false billings submitted to government programs.

Acting U.S. Attorney Announces Successful Conclusion Of Agreement With Westchester County Jail To remedy Constitutional Violations At The Jail : The Office successfully resolved findings that the Westchester County Jail engaged in a pattern and practice of constitutional violations regarding use of force against inmates, treatment of minors, and provision of health care to the Jail’s more than 1000 inmates.  the Office worked closely with a federal monitor and public officials to bring the Jail into compliance; as a result, use of force incidents plummeted, and the Jail’s medical, mental health, and re-entry programs were nationally recognized. Fair Housing Act United States Attorney Implements Groundbreaking Settlement With Meta Platform, Inc., Formerly Known As Facebook, To Address Discrimination In The Delivery Of Housing Ads : On June 22, 2022, the Office filed a complaint and consent decree in United States v. Meta Platforms, Inc. f/k/a Facebook, Inc ., the first algorithmic discrimination case brought by the United States under the Fair Housing Act.  For the first time, Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook, Inc., agreed to change its delivery algorithm to correct for bias.  This settlement affects millions of Facebook users and also marks the first time that Meta will be subject to court oversight for its ad targeting and delivery system. United States Settles Fair Housing Act Lawsuit Against Artimus Construction For Failure To Construct Apartments Accessible To Persons With Disabilities : On April 7, 2023, the Office settled a Fair Housing Act lawsuit against Artimus Construction for failure to construct apartments accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Under the settlement, Artimus agreed to make retrofits at rental buildings in Harlem and Chelsea and establish a fund to compensate aggrieved persons.  This is the 18th settlement reached by the Office with developers and architects to remedy inaccessible housing in this District, including settlements to resolve suits against The Durst Organization, Glenwood Management, Silverstein Properties, Related Companies, and Atlantic Development. Acting U.S. Attorney Announces Consent Decree Resolving Claims That Owner Of Manhattan Condominium Discriminated Against Tenant On The Basis Of Disability : The Office routinely initiates lawsuits on behalf of individuals with disabilities who have been denied housing because they seek to live with assistance animals.  The Office has been uniformly successful in these matters, which result in the landlords providing compensation to the resident, changing their reasonable accommodation policies, and permitting the resident to live with an assistance animal. American with Disabilities Act U.S. Attorney Announces Agreement With New York University To Increase Accessibility Of Student Housing Facilities : The Civil Rights Unit works to make sure that colleges and universities are accessible for individuals with disabilities.  For example, in November 2022, the Office reached an agreement with New York University to increase the accessibility of NYU’s student housing facilities.  The agreement covers all of NYU’s student housing facilities in the New York metropolitan area for a total of more than 4,000 student housing units.  Similarly, the Office reached an agreement with the City University of New York (“CUNY”), requiring CUNY to provide individual relief to a student with a visual impairment who was excluded from full participation in CUNY’s academic courses and to implement systemwide policies to ensure future compliance with the ADA across CUNY’s 25 colleges in the five boroughs of New York City, which collectively serve 243,000 students. U.S. Attorney Files And Simultaneously Settles Lawsuit Against Jujamcyn Theaters LLC To Improve Accessibility At Five Of Broadway’s Most Historic Theaters : The Civil Rights Unit has a long history of ensuring that the most iconic New York City sites are accessible to people with disabilities.  For example, the Office has ensured the accessibility of numerous Broadway theaters, having reached settlement agreements with the major Broadway theater organizations — Jujamcyn Theaters, the Shubert Theaters, and the Nederlander.  The Office also reached settlement agreements with the owners and operators of Yankee Stadium, Radio City Music Hall, the Metropolitan Opera, Madison Square Garden, the Apollo, and the Vessel at Hudson Yards, among many others.  This enforcement work is also pursued to ensure that local restaurants, libraries, movie theatres, and other places of public accommodation are compliant with the ADA. District Court Rules That MTA’ Renovation Of Subway Station Triggered MTA’s Obligation Under ADA To Install Elevators Unless Technically Infeasible : The Office obtained a major ruling against the Metropolitan Transit Authority (“MTA”) and New York City Transit Authority to increase the accessibility of the New York City subway system.  The ruling effectively requires MTA to install elevators when conducting certain station renovations, without regard to cost, unless it is technically infeasible to do so.  In the wake of the ruling, MTA has worked to dramatically increase the number of accessible stations throughout the City. The Office has entered into Voluntary Compliance Agreements with a number of summer camps, requiring them to implement policies to accommodate the needs of children with disabilities and train all personnel who may interact with prospective and enrolled campers and camp visitors. Employment Discrimination U.S. Attorney Resolves Employment Discrimination Suit With The Town/Village OF Harrison, New York, And Its Fire Department : In June 2023, the Office resolved a lawsuit alleging that the Town/Village of Harrison in Westchester County, along with its Fire Department, discriminated against a female firefighter on the basis of sex and retaliated against her in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  As part of the settlement, the Town of Harrison admitted that it did not take any disciplinary action against a male firefighter who ultimately pled guilty to harassing the female firefighter.  The settlement also required the Town to implement comprehensive policy changes and provide significant compensation to the victim, resulting in one of the largest payments by a local government in an employment discrimination case brought by the United States on behalf of a single individual.

US v. Apex Building Co. In September 2023, the Office filed a complaint and entered into a consent decree with Apex Building Company, which had violated lead paint safety regulations in hundreds of renovations.  The consent decree included the second largest civil penalty ever imposed under the lead paint regulations and required Apex to take steps to mitigate potential harms caused by its conduct.

Other RCRA litigation and settlements can be found here . Pesticides In June 2022, the Office entered into a settlement with Tzumi Innovations, LLC, for the sale of unregistered antimicrobial products.  The settlement required payment of a $1.5 million civil penalty, the largest civil penalty ever obtained in a judicial settlement under the governing statute, and barred Tzumi from future sale or distribution of unregistered antimicrobial products. Superfund and Related Litigation In the Tronox bankruptcy, after years of litigation and negotiation, the Office entered into a settlement recovering more than $4.4 billion from affiliates of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation for environmental claims and liabilities.  This settlement constituted the largest litigation recovery by the United States for the clean-up of environmental contamination. Other Superfund litigation and settlements can be found here . Food Safety The Office works closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s to pursue violations of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act. Food safety litigation and settlements can be found here . General Defensive Litigation Constitutional and Program Litigation The Office defends the Executive Office of the President, the Cabinet, other government officials, and most federal agencies and departments of the Executive Branch in civil actions challenging the legality of federal policies and programs.  Much of the Civil Division’s work in this area involves high-profile lawsuits, novel issues of constitutional and administrative law, and important issues of public policy.  This category includes cases brought against federal officials in both their individual and official capacity. Litigation can range from single-plaintiff actions to complex nationwide class actions.  AUSAs handling these cases often must coordinate with the involved federal agencies, as well as with senior leadership within the Department of Justice. In its Constitutional Law practice, the Civil Division defends actions challenging the constitutionality of federal statutes, regulations, or policies, or the actions of individual federal employees.  For example, the Civil Division recently intervened in People of the State of New York v. Arm or Ally, LLC , 22 Civ. 6124, to defend against a Second Amendment challenge to the Gun Control Act and a recent regulation enacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that makes clear the Act’s requirements apply to ghost guns.  And Civil Division AUSAs are currently representing the United States Military Academy at West Point in a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the use of race as a factor in admissions, as a violation of Equal Protection ( see Students for Fair Admissions v. United States Military Academy at West Point , 23 Civ. 8262). Many of these cases involve cutting edge First Amendment issues.  The Civil Division is defending President Biden and senior White House officials in Berenson v. Biden , 23 Civ. 3048, alleging that the administration’s attempts to combat the spread of false information regarding COVID-19 vaccines on social media constituted a violation of the First Amendment.  The Civil Division represented the government in a First Amendment challenge to provisions of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act that required NGOs that received federal funding to adopt a policy against prostitution and sex trafficking ( see Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID , 15-974 (2d Cir.)). And in Stagg, PC v. Department of State , 19-811 (2d Cir.), the Civil Division successfully handled a First Amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting the transfer of technical data required for the manufacture of certain munitions to foreign persons. The Civil Division also defends cases challenging government action or inaction under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), many of which involve novel legal issues and consequential public interests.  For example, Civil Division AUSAs recently successfully defended an APA action challenging hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for licensed home care service agencies located in New York. And SDNY AUSAs have defended a number of challenges to the authority of Administrative Law Judges on the grounds that they are inferior officers who were not properly appointed in accordance with Article II of the United States Constitution. Employment Litigation, Torts, and Medical Malpractice The Civil Division represents the United States, including its officers and agencies, in employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The Division also represents the United States in suits for monetary damages alleging negligent or wrongful acts.  And Civil Division AUSAs represents the VA and other federally funded medical providers in lawsuits alleging malpractice.  These matters, which frequently go to trial, often involve complex fact patterns and require engaging with experts on a wide range of topics. National Security and Foreign Policy Representing Foreign Policy Interests The Civil Division is involved in representing the foreign policy interests of the United States: Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , 22 Civ. 5199 (supporting a stay of litigation against Sri Lanka to recover on defaulted sovereign bonds, in order to advance U.S. foreign policy interest in orderly and consensual sovereign debt restructuring); Kunstler v. CIA , 22 Civ. 6913 (alleging that the CIA had unlawfully monitored Julian Assange’s meetings with third parties while he resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London); Tanvir v. Tanzin , 13 Civ. 6951, 23-738 (2d Cir.) (challenge under the First and Fifth Amendments, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to Plaintiffs’ alleged placement on the No Fly List, which they claimed was due to their refusal to become informants for the FBI). Advising Federal Courts on Foreign Government Immunities Civil Division AUSAs prepare submissions advising judges on issues related to foreign government immunities: Havlish v. The Taliban , 03 Civ. 9848 (statements of interest in actions brought by victims of the September 11 attack to seize funds of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s central bank held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan). Protecting Classified National Security Information Civil Division AUSAs handle matters involving the protection of national security information: In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 , 03 MDL 1570 (successfully asserting state secrets and law enforcement privileges to protect certain classified and otherwise sensitive information sought in discovery); New York Times Co. v. CIA , No. 18-2112 (2d Cir.) (litigation regarding refusal by CIA to confirm or deny whether it possessed records involving covert funding of rebel forces in Syria); American Civil Liberties Union v. CIA , No. 18-2265 (2d Cir.) (request for records cited in the publicly released executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s Committee Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program) ; Osen v. CENTCOM , 19 Civ. 6867 (withholding of photographs depicting improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. military vehicles in Iraq); Open Society Justice Initiative v. Department of State et al. , 19 Civ. 234 (requests for records from multiple members of the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi); Osen v. OFAC , 19 Civ. 405 (challenges to withholding of classified information in memoranda and associated intelligence reports that supported the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s sanction designations of three charities that were determined to be support nodes for Hamas). Tax and Bankruptcy Bankruptcy Civil Division AUSAs represent the interests of the United States in bankruptcy cases filed in the Southern District of New York, including bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears, AIG, and Lehman Brothers).  Examples include: In re Purdue Pharma L.P ., No. 23-124 (S. Ct):  The Office represents the interests of the United States in the bankruptcy proceeding of Purdue Pharma L.P.  Our representation includes advocating on behalf of the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The Office has also opposed efforts to permit an involuntary third-party release of the Sackler family, who are not debtors in the bankruptcy case, arguing, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Code does not authorize the release of non-debtors from personal liability to other non-debtors. The legality of third-party releases is presently before the Supreme Court. In re Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc . , No. 23 Civ. 2171:  In the bankruptcy of a cryptocurrency investment company, the bankruptcy court included a so-called “exculpation” clause in the debtors’ plan, which purported to extinguish (among other things) civil and criminal liability for the debtors’ and various third parties’ future acts.  The Office has argued that the Bankruptcy Code does not permit such exculpation and that courts may not involuntarily release the government’s civil, criminal, and administrative claims. Tax Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including bringing affirmative cases to collect unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for taxpayers’ failures to report their foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases to prevent sophisticated corporate entities from engaging in abusive transactions to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to put fraudulent tax preparers and tax-shelter promoters out of business.  Examples include: New York v. Mnuchin , No. 19-3962 (2d Cir.):  In this case the States of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland challenged the constitutionality of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that limited the Internal Revenue Code’s state and local tax deduction for individuals to $10,000.  The Office successfully defended the provision in the district court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Those courts agreed with our arguments that principles of federalism did not constrain Congress’s ability to limit this deduction and that the provision at issue did not coerce the states to change their own tax systems. AIG v. United States , No. 09 Civ. 1871:  This case involved seven cross-border financial transactions that the United States asserted were abusive tax shelters designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits that AIG improperly attempted to use to reduce its tax liabilities in the United States.  The Office asserted that these transactions lacked any meaningful economic substance, were devoid of any legitimate business purpose, and instead were designed solely to manufacture hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits to which AIG was not entitled.    According to the terms of the settlement reached in 2020, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that it claimed for the 1997 tax year and all later tax years for these same transactions, totaling more than $400 million, would be disallowed in their entirety.  AIG further agreed to pay a 10% tax penalty. United States v. Alvarez , No. 21 Civ. 1930:  The Office filed a civil complaint alleging that Rafael Alvarez and his tax-preparation business ATAX New York LLC had prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their clients in which they falsely reduced their clients’ tax liabilities and generated tax refunds to which those clients were not entitled.  As part of a settlement in 2021, the defendants admitted that they prepared and filed many federal income tax returns that included claims of expenses, losses, or “head of household” status that lacked adequate supporting information or documentation, and that these unsupported entries caused the clients’ tax liabilities to be substantially understated.  The defendants consented to a permanent injunction that, among other things, prevented them from acting as federal tax return preparers, and they agreed to pay disgorgement. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Civil Division Priorities Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email Civil Frauds $6.5 Million Settlement with Cardiologist and His Medical Practice for Paying Millions in Kickbacks for Referrals :  In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against a cardiologist and his medical practice, Gramercy Cardiac Diagnostic Services P.C. (“Gramercy Cardiac”), alleging that he paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to physicians and their practices for patient referrals.  The kickbacks took the form of inflated office “rental payments” and fees paid to contracted cardiologists. $678 Million Anti-Kickback Statute Settlement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals for Operating Sham Speaker Programs :  In 2020, the Office reached a $678 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Novartis”), resolving claims that Novartis violated the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute by providing doctors with cash payments, recreational outings, lavish meals, and expensive alcohol to induce them to prescribe Novartis’s cardiovascular and diabetes drugs, which were then reimbursed by federal healthcare programs.  The Government alleged that Novartis organized tens of thousands of sham speaker events at high-end restaurants and other venues and paid exorbitant speaker fees to doctors who gave no meaningful presentations.  When those doctors then prescribed Novartis’s drugs, federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for these tainted prescriptions. Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Medical Device Company for Creating and Selling a Fake Medical Component That Was Implanted Into Patients :  In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Stimwave LLC (“Stimwave”), a Florida-based medical device company, alleging that Stimwave created and sold a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.  Under the civil settlement, Stimwave agreed to pay $8.6 million to the United States.  Simultaneous with the resolution of the civil case, the SDNY’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit announced the filing of criminal charges against the former CEO of Stimwave for her role in the fraudulent scheme. $49 Million Settlement with Biotech Testing Company for Fraudulent Billing and Kickback Practices :  In 2020, the Office resolved claims against Progenity, Inc. (“Progenity”), a biotechnology company that provides molecular and diagnostic tests, for fraudulently billing federal healthcare programs for prenatal tests and providing kickbacks to physicians to induce them to order Progenity tests for their patients.  As alleged in the lawsuit, Progenity fraudulently used a billing code that misrepresented the tests provided and provided illegal kickbacks in the form of excessive “draw fees” to physicians, meals and happy hours for physicians and their staff, and the improper reduction or waiver of patient coinsurance and deductible payments.  Under the settlement, Progenity agreed to pay a total of $49 million to resolve various governmental claims. $40.5 Million Settlement with Durable Medical Equipment Provider for Fraudulent Billing Practices :  In 2020, Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. and its affiliate, Apria Healthcare LLC (together, “Apria”) agreed to pay a total of $40.5 million to resolve governmental claims that, among other things, Apria submitted false claims to federal healthcare programs seeking reimbursement for the rental of costly non-invasive ventilators to program beneficiaries.  As alleged, those beneficiaries were not using the non-invasive ventilators, such that the devices were not medically necessary; Apria admitted that it continued to seek reimbursement from federal programs after it had information that patients had stopped using their ventilators.  In addition, the government’s lawsuit alleged that Apria improperly waived patient co-insurance payments for the devices. $7.85 Million Settlement with Skilled Nursing Facility for Fraudulently Switching Residents’ Healthcare Coverage to Boost Medicare Payments :  In 2022, the Office settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against Plaza Rehab and Nursing Center (“Plaza Rehab Center”) and Citadel Consulting Group LLC (“Citadel”), which alleged that Plaza Rehab Center, acting at the direction of Citadel, fraudulently switched the type of Medicare coverage in which elderly residents were enrolled in order to maximize the Medicare payments that Plaza Rehab Center would receive.  The residents and their families often did not request, consent to, or know about the change to their healthcare coverage, which had the potential to impact their out-of-pocket payments, the scope of the services and care covered, and their drug coverage plan.  As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $7.85 million. Settlement of Lawsuit Alleging that Bronx Nursing Home Paid Kickbacks for Patient Referrals and Switched Residents’ Healthcare Coverage Without Their Consent :  In 2023, the Office settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Morris Park Nursing Home (“Morris Park”), a skilled nursing facility located in the Bronx, New York, and individuals formerly associated with Morris Park.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes that violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The first scheme involved cash payments made to a supervisor at a nearby hospital for patient referrals, and the second scheme involved switching residents’ Medicare coverage without their consent in order to increase the Medicare payments that Morris Park received.  Under the settlements, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $3.46 million. $37 Million Medicare Part C Fraud Settlement with Cigna :  In 2023, the Office reached a $37 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against The Cigna Group (“Cigna”) and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations.  The settlement resolved claims that Cigna submitted to the government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments it received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.  The government alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by Cigna to conduct in-home assessments of plan members, and that the healthcare providers who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported. $269.2 Million Recoveries in Healthcare Fraud Settlements with Walgreens :  In 2019, the Office filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens’s improper billings to government healthcare programs.  The lawsuit alleged that Walgreens improperly billed the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens sought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated prices. $20 Million Dollar Settlement with Rochester Drug Cooperative for Failing to Report Suspicious Orders of Controlled Substances to the DEA :  In 2019, Rochester Drug Cooperative (“RDC”), a wholesale drug distributor, agreed to pay a $20 million penalty to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Office under the Controlled Substances Act.  The complaint alleged that between May 2012 and November 2016, RDC knowingly failed to comply with its legal obligation to report thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as Oxycodone and fentanyl, despite being aware that many of its largest pharmacy customers exhibited “red flags” associated with the diversion of such drugs. The Office’s investigation also ultimately led to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with RDC and a first-of-its-kind felony conviction of RDC’s former CEO for conspiring to unlawfully distribute controlled substances and defrauding the DEA. $72.6 Million Settlement of Fraud Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo Bank for Overcharging Foreign Exchange Customers :  In 2021, Wells Fargo Bank (“Wells Fargo”) agreed to pay a total of approximately $72.6 million to resolve claims brought under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, alleging that Wells Fargo fraudulently overcharged hundreds of commercial customers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses and federally-insured financial institutions, who used Wells Fargo’s foreign exchange (“FX”) service.  The suit alleged that from 2010 through 2017, Wells Fargo FX sales specialists defrauded nearly 800 customers by systematically charging them higher markups on FX transactions than they represented Wells Fargo would charge and concealing those overcharges through various misrepresentations and deceptive practices. Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Former Hunter College Professor and Hunter College for Fraudulently Using Federal Research Funds :  In 2023, the Office resolved claims under the False Claims Act against Jeffrey T. Parsons-Hietikko (“Parsons”), a former psychology professor at Hunter College (“Hunter”), and Hunter, for the fraudulent misuse of research grant funds provided by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”).  Parsons previously served as Director of Hunter’s Center for HIV Educational Studies (“CHEST”).  Among other things, the government’s lawsuit alleged that for years, Parsons improperly invoiced personal expenses to NIH funds, including expenses relating to scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, and a tropical birthday celebration.  The lawsuit further alleged that Hunter used NIH funds to pay Parsons tens of thousands of dollars in retention bonuses without disclosing those payments to NIH as required, and that Parsons and Hunter submitted false timekeeping records that resulted in the use of NIH grant funds to compensate CHEST staff for work performed for Parsons’s private clients.  Under the settlement, Parsons and Hunter agreed to pay $375,000 and $200,000, respectively. Settlements in Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Three Companies for False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation on Federal Construction Projects :  In 2019 and 2021 , the Office resolved claims against three companies for their roles in a scheme to make false statements about disadvantaged business participation on two federal construction projects.  Under Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, contracts for certain federally funded projects require the participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that, in connection with federally funded steel painting projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza, Ahern Painting Contractors Co. misrepresented that Tower Maintenance Corp., a certified DBE, was solely performing millions of dollars of work on the two projects.  In fact, much of that work was being performed by Spectrum Painting Corp., a non-DBE.  Under the settlements, the three defendants agreed to pay over $3.5 million. $5.3 Million Settlement of Lawsuit Against New York City for Fraudulently Obtaining FEMA Funds Following Superstorm Sandy :  In 2019, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against the City of New York (the “City”) alleging that the New York City Department of Transportation (“NYCDOT”) fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by falsely claiming that numerous NYCDOT vehicles were damaged during Superstorm Sandy.  Under the settlement, the City agreed to pay $5.3 million. $22.8 Million Settlement of Customs Fraud Lawsuit Against Vitamin Importer for Underpaying Customs Duties Owed on Products Imported Into the United States :  In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil lawsuit against International Vitamins Corporation (“IVC”), a United States-based company that imports and sells vitamins and nutritional supplements from China.  The government’s lawsuit alleged that for years, IVC defrauded the United States by misclassifying more than 30 of its products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in order to avoid paying customs duties, and by failing to pay back duties owed to the United States even after IVC finally corrected its longstanding misclassifications.  Under the settlement, IVC agreed to pay $22.8 million. Settlement of Customs Fraud Suit Against Clothing Companies and Their Former CEO for Misrepresenting the Value of Goods to Avoid Paying Customs Duties :  In 2021, the Office resolved a lawsuit against Stargate Apparel, Inc., Rivstar Apparel, Inc., and Joseph Bailey (the former CEO and owner of both companies), for employing a variety of schemes to defraud the United States of millions of dollars in customs duties, by submitting invoices to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that falsely understated the true value of the clothing they imported into the United States.  Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $6 million.  This civil settlement was in addition to a $1,661,617 forfeiture amount that Bailey was ordered to pay in parallel criminal proceedings handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit. The Office has a number of ongoing investigations related to fraudulent conduct during the pandemic. With the assistance of our law enforcement partners, Civil Division AUSAs are investigating fraud related to the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program and other government relief programs that were designed to help those in financial need, as well as pandemic-related health care fraud schemes involving false billings submitted to government programs. Civil Rights Justice Department Announces Investigation Of New York City Police Department’s Special Victims Division : Pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law, on June 30, 2022, the Office announced a civil investigation into the Special Victims Division (“SVD”) of the New York City Police Department.  The investigation will assess whether the SVD engages in a pattern or practice of sex-biased policing in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.  This is the first federal investigation of a police department based solely on whether its policing practices are sex biased. United States Attorney Announces Investigation Of The Mount Vernon Police Department : On December 3, 2021, the Office announced a civil investigation into the Mount Vernon Police Department (“MVPD”), assessing whether MVPD engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory policing, uses excessive force, and conducts unconstitutional strip and body cavity searches.

United States Attorney Implements Groundbreaking Settlement With Meta Platform, Inc., Formerly Known As Facebook, To Address Discrimination In The Delivery Of Housing Ads : On June 22, 2022, the Office filed a complaint and consent decree in United States v. Meta Platforms, Inc. f/k/a Facebook, Inc ., the first algorithmic discrimination case brought by the United States under the Fair Housing Act.  For the first time, Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook, Inc., agreed to change its delivery algorithm to correct for bias.  This settlement affects millions of Facebook users and also marks the first time that Meta will be subject to court oversight for its ad targeting and delivery system. United States Settles Fair Housing Act Lawsuit Against Artimus Construction For Failure To Construct Apartments Accessible To Persons With Disabilities : On April 7, 2023, the Office settled a Fair Housing Act lawsuit against Artimus Construction for failure to construct apartments accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Under the settlement, Artimus agreed to make retrofits at rental buildings in Harlem and Chelsea and establish a fund to compensate aggrieved persons.  This is the 18th settlement reached by the Office with developers and architects to remedy inaccessible housing in this District, including settlements to resolve suits against The Durst Organization, Glenwood Management, Silverstein Properties, Related Companies, and Atlantic Development.

U.S. Attorney Announces Agreement With New York University To Increase Accessibility Of Student Housing Facilities : The Civil Rights Unit works to make sure that colleges and universities are accessible for individuals with disabilities.  For example, in November 2022, the Office reached an agreement with New York University to increase the accessibility of NYU’s student housing facilities.  The agreement covers all of NYU’s student housing facilities in the New York metropolitan area for a total of more than 4,000 student housing units.  Similarly, the Office reached an agreement with the City University of New York (“CUNY”), requiring CUNY to provide individual relief to a student with a visual impairment who was excluded from full participation in CUNY’s academic courses and to implement systemwide policies to ensure future compliance with the ADA across CUNY’s 25 colleges in the five boroughs of New York City, which collectively serve 243,000 students. U.S. Attorney Files And Simultaneously Settles Lawsuit Against Jujamcyn Theaters LLC To Improve Accessibility At Five Of Broadway’s Most Historic Theaters : The Civil Rights Unit has a long history of ensuring that the most iconic New York City sites are accessible to people with disabilities.  For example, the Office has ensured the accessibility of numerous Broadway theaters, having reached settlement agreements with the major Broadway theater organizations — Jujamcyn Theaters, the Shubert Theaters, and the Nederlander.  The Office also reached settlement agreements with the owners and operators of Yankee Stadium, Radio City Music Hall, the Metropolitan Opera, Madison Square Garden, the Apollo, and the Vessel at Hudson Yards, among many others.  This enforcement work is also pursued to ensure that local restaurants, libraries, movie theatres, and other places of public accommodation are compliant with the ADA. District Court Rules That MTA’ Renovation Of Subway Station Triggered MTA’s Obligation Under ADA To Install Elevators Unless Technically Infeasible : The Office obtained a major ruling against the Metropolitan Transit Authority (“MTA”) and New York City Transit Authority to increase the accessibility of the New York City subway system.  The ruling effectively requires MTA to install elevators when conducting certain station renovations, without regard to cost, unless it is technically infeasible to do so.  In the wake of the ruling, MTA has worked to dramatically increase the number of accessible stations throughout the City. The Office has entered into Voluntary Compliance Agreements with a number of summer camps, requiring them to implement policies to accommodate the needs of children with disabilities and train all personnel who may interact with prospective and enrolled campers and camp visitors. U.S. Attorney Resolves Employment Discrimination Suit With The Town/Village OF Harrison, New York, And Its Fire Department : In June 2023, the Office resolved a lawsuit alleging that the Town/Village of Harrison in Westchester County, along with its Fire Department, discriminated against a female firefighter on the basis of sex and retaliated against her in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  As part of the settlement, the Town of Harrison admitted that it did not take any disciplinary action against a male firefighter who ultimately pled guilty to harassing the female firefighter.  The settlement also required the Town to implement comprehensive policy changes and provide significant compensation to the victim, resulting in one of the largest payments by a local government in an employment discrimination case brought by the United States on behalf of a single individual.

Food safety litigation and settlements can be found here . General Defensive Litigation The Office defends the Executive Office of the President, the Cabinet, other government officials, and most federal agencies and departments of the Executive Branch in civil actions challenging the legality of federal policies and programs.  Much of the Civil Division’s work in this area involves high-profile lawsuits, novel issues of constitutional and administrative law, and important issues of public policy.  This category includes cases brought against federal officials in both their individual and official capacity. Litigation can range from single-plaintiff actions to complex nationwide class actions.  AUSAs handling these cases often must coordinate with the involved federal agencies, as well as with senior leadership within the Department of Justice. In its Constitutional Law practice, the Civil Division defends actions challenging the constitutionality of federal statutes, regulations, or policies, or the actions of individual federal employees.  For example, the Civil Division recently intervened in People of the State of New York v. Arm or Ally, LLC , 22 Civ. 6124, to defend against a Second Amendment challenge to the Gun Control Act and a recent regulation enacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that makes clear the Act’s requirements apply to ghost guns.  And Civil Division AUSAs are currently representing the United States Military Academy at West Point in a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the use of race as a factor in admissions, as a violation of Equal Protection ( see Students for Fair Admissions v. United States Military Academy at West Point , 23 Civ. 8262). Many of these cases involve cutting edge First Amendment issues.  The Civil Division is defending President Biden and senior White House officials in Berenson v. Biden , 23 Civ. 3048, alleging that the administration’s attempts to combat the spread of false information regarding COVID-19 vaccines on social media constituted a violation of the First Amendment.  The Civil Division represented the government in a First Amendment challenge to provisions of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act that required NGOs that received federal funding to adopt a policy against prostitution and sex trafficking ( see Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID , 15-974 (2d Cir.)). And in Stagg, PC v. Department of State , 19-811 (2d Cir.), the Civil Division successfully handled a First Amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting the transfer of technical data required for the manufacture of certain munitions to foreign persons. The Civil Division also defends cases challenging government action or inaction under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), many of which involve novel legal issues and consequential public interests.  For example, Civil Division AUSAs recently successfully defended an APA action challenging hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for licensed home care service agencies located in New York. And SDNY AUSAs have defended a number of challenges to the authority of Administrative Law Judges on the grounds that they are inferior officers who were not properly appointed in accordance with Article II of the United States Constitution. The Civil Division represents the United States, including its officers and agencies, in employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The Division also represents the United States in suits for monetary damages alleging negligent or wrongful acts.  And Civil Division AUSAs represents the VA and other federally funded medical providers in lawsuits alleging malpractice.  These matters, which frequently go to trial, often involve complex fact patterns and require engaging with experts on a wide range of topics. National Security and Foreign Policy The Civil Division is involved in representing the foreign policy interests of the United States: Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , 22 Civ. 5199 (supporting a stay of litigation against Sri Lanka to recover on defaulted sovereign bonds, in order to advance U.S. foreign policy interest in orderly and consensual sovereign debt restructuring); Kunstler v. CIA , 22 Civ. 6913 (alleging that the CIA had unlawfully monitored Julian Assange’s meetings with third parties while he resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London); Tanvir v. Tanzin , 13 Civ. 6951, 23-738 (2d Cir.) (challenge under the First and Fifth Amendments, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to Plaintiffs’ alleged placement on the No Fly List, which they claimed was due to their refusal to become informants for the FBI). Civil Division AUSAs prepare submissions advising judges on issues related to foreign government immunities: Havlish v. The Taliban , 03 Civ. 9848 (statements of interest in actions brought by victims of the September 11 attack to seize funds of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s central bank held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan). Civil Division AUSAs handle matters involving the protection of national security information: In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 , 03 MDL 1570 (successfully asserting state secrets and law enforcement privileges to protect certain classified and otherwise sensitive information sought in discovery); New York Times Co. v. CIA , No. 18-2112 (2d Cir.) (litigation regarding refusal by CIA to confirm or deny whether it possessed records involving covert funding of rebel forces in Syria); American Civil Liberties Union v. CIA , No. 18-2265 (2d Cir.) (request for records cited in the publicly released executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s Committee Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program) ; Osen v. CENTCOM , 19 Civ. 6867 (withholding of photographs depicting improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. military vehicles in Iraq); Open Society Justice Initiative v. Department of State et al. , 19 Civ. 234 (requests for records from multiple members of the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi); Osen v. OFAC , 19 Civ. 405 (challenges to withholding of classified information in memoranda and associated intelligence reports that supported the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s sanction designations of three charities that were determined to be support nodes for Hamas). Tax and Bankruptcy Civil Division AUSAs represent the interests of the United States in bankruptcy cases filed in the Southern District of New York, including bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears, AIG, and Lehman Brothers).  Examples include: In re Purdue Pharma L.P ., No. 23-124 (S. Ct):  The Office represents the interests of the United States in the bankruptcy proceeding of Purdue Pharma L.P.  Our representation includes advocating on behalf of the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The Office has also opposed efforts to permit an involuntary third-party release of the Sackler family, who are not debtors in the bankruptcy case, arguing, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Code does not authorize the release of non-debtors from personal liability to other non-debtors. The legality of third-party releases is presently before the Supreme Court. In re Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc . , No. 23 Civ. 2171:  In the bankruptcy of a cryptocurrency investment company, the bankruptcy court included a so-called “exculpation” clause in the debtors’ plan, which purported to extinguish (among other things) civil and criminal liability for the debtors’ and various third parties’ future acts.  The Office has argued that the Bankruptcy Code does not permit such exculpation and that courts may not involuntarily release the government’s civil, criminal, and administrative claims. Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including bringing affirmative cases to collect unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for taxpayers’ failures to report their foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases to prevent sophisticated corporate entities from engaging in abusive transactions to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to put fraudulent tax preparers and tax-shelter promoters out of business.  Examples include: New York v. Mnuchin , No. 19-3962 (2d Cir.):  In this case the States of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland challenged the constitutionality of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that limited the Internal Revenue Code’s state and local tax deduction for individuals to $10,000.  The Office successfully defended the provision in the district court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Those courts agreed with our arguments that principles of federalism did not constrain Congress’s ability to limit this deduction and that the provision at issue did not coerce the states to change their own tax systems. AIG v. United States , No. 09 Civ. 1871:  This case involved seven cross-border financial transactions that the United States asserted were abusive tax shelters designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits that AIG improperly attempted to use to reduce its tax liabilities in the United States.  The Office asserted that these transactions lacked any meaningful economic substance, were devoid of any legitimate business purpose, and instead were designed solely to manufacture hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits to which AIG was not entitled.    According to the terms of the settlement reached in 2020, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that it claimed for the 1997 tax year and all later tax years for these same transactions, totaling more than $400 million, would be disallowed in their entirety.  AIG further agreed to pay a 10% tax penalty. United States v. Alvarez , No. 21 Civ. 1930:  The Office filed a civil complaint alleging that Rafael Alvarez and his tax-preparation business ATAX New York LLC had prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their clients in which they falsely reduced their clients’ tax liabilities and generated tax refunds to which those clients were not entitled.  As part of a settlement in 2021, the defendants admitted that they prepared and filed many federal income tax returns that included claims of expenses, losses, or “head of household” status that lacked adequate supporting information or documentation, and that these unsupported entries caused the clients’ tax liabilities to be substantially understated.  The defendants consented to a permanent injunction that, among other things, prevented them from acting as federal tax return preparers, and they agreed to pay disgorgement. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Diddy,” a/k/a “PD,” a/k/a “Love,” with racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.  Between in or about 2004 and the present, Combs abused, threatened, and coerced women and others, and led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes.   As alleged, Combs caused at least three female victims to engage in commercial sex acts using force, fraud, and coercion.  These commercial sex acts included, but were not limited to, days-long sexual activity with male commercial sex workers, which Combs referred to as “Freak Offs.”  Combs also committed multiple acts of violence, including kidnapping and assaults. On one occasion, Combs dangled a victim over an apartment balcony.  Trial against Combs is scheduled for May 2025. Alexander Brothers Charged with Sex Trafficking Offenses : In December 2024, the Office charged three brothers, Alon Alexander, Oren Alexander, and Tal Alexander with sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion, and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.  As alleged in the indictment, from in or about 2010 through in or about 2021, the Alexander brothers worked together and with others to engage in sex trafficking, including by repeatedly drugging, sexually assaulting, and raping dozens of female victims.  Using their wealth and connections, including Oren and Tal Alexander’s prominent positions in real estate, the Alexander brothers created and facilitated opportunities to sexually assault women.  The Alexander brothers used the promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations to lure and entice women to these events, and then—on multiple occasions—forcibly raped and sexually assaulted women who attended.  At times, multiple men, including one or more of the Alexander brothers, participated in these sexual assaults.  In many instances, the victims were drugged, and in some instances, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop. College Professor Jorge Ramos Pled Guilty to Human Smuggling and Possession of Child Pornography :  Jorge Ramos was charged with inducing and transporting two victims to travel interstate to engage in unlawful sexual activity and with smuggling and harboring a third victim, as well as child pornography offenses.  Ramos induced the victims to travel from El Salvador to the United States with promises of a better life, including educational and other opportunities.  Ramos paid human smugglers to transport the victims across the U.S. border.  Once they arrived at Ramos’s apartment in the Bronx, Ramos raped, sexually assaulted, and sexually abused the victims. Ramos attempted to control the victims by, among other things, ordering the victims to stay inside his apartment, attempting to isolate the victims from other people, and threatening to report the victims to immigration officials for deportation back to El Salvador.  In August 2024, Ramos pled guilty to three counts of human smuggling, and to one count of possession of child pornography.  As part of his plea, Ramos admitted to sexually abusing all three victims. In February 2025, Ramos was sentenced to 97 months’ imprisonment. Lawrence Ray Charged with Extortion, Sex Trafficking, and Other Offenses :  In January 2023, Lawrence Ray, a/k/a “Lawrence Grecco,” was sentenced to 60 years in prison following his conviction at trial for extortion, sex trafficking, forced labor, and money laundering offenses.  Ray used physical and psychological threats and coercion to indoctrinate and exploit a group of college students in Westchester County, as well as other victims.  Ray extorted approximately $1 million from at least five victims; forced certain victims to perform unpaid labor on a family member’s North Carolina property; and caused, through force, fraud, and coercion, at least one victim to engage in commercial sex acts.  His alleged tactics included sleep deprivation, psychological and sexual humiliation, verbal abuse, threats of physical violence, physical violence, threats of criminal legal action, alienating the victims from their families, and exploiting the victims’ mental health vulnerabilities.  Victims made payments to Ray by draining their parents’ savings, opening credit lines, soliciting contributions from acquaintances, selling real estate ownership, and at Ray’s direction, performing unpaid labor for Ray and earning money through prostitution.  His codefendant Isabella Pollack pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and was sentenced to 54 months in prison. Ghislaine Maxwell Convicted of Conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to Sexually Abuse Minors and Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison : In June 2022, Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in conspiring to abuse minor girls with Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004.  Over the course of a decade, Maxwell and Epstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport them to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere.  The girls — some of whom were as young as 14 years old — were then sexually abused, often under the guise of a “massage.”  Maxwell was convicted at trial in December 2021. Former Obstetrician/Gynecologist Robert Hadden Convicted of Sexually Abusing Numerous Patients and Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison : In July 2023, Robert Hadden was sentenced to 20 years in prison following his conviction by a jury after a trial on charges for inducing victims to travel interstate to his medical offices in Manhattan so that he could sexually abuse them.  Hadden, who practiced medicine between in or about 1987 to 2012, sexually abused dozens of patients over the course of more than two decades under the guise of purported medical examinations.  To carry out the abuse, Hadden exploited the power differential inherent in the doctor-patient relationship, built rapport with victims, asked victims invasive and unprompted questions about their sexual activity, and conducted fake breast and vaginal exams. Former Bronx Public Charter School Teacher Pleads Guilty In Connection With Sexual Abuse Of Five Former Students :  In September 2023, Jesus Concepcion, a former teacher at a public charter school in the Bronx, pled guilty to a 10-count indictment charging him in connection with the sexual abuse of five minor victims who were also his students.  From 2000 until 2007, Concepcion abused his position as a teacher to induce and attempt to induce five of his students to engage in sexual acts by leading them to believe that they were in a romantic relationship with him.  Concepcion engaged in sexual acts with four of the victims at multiple locations, including the school, a motel in New Jersey, and his home in New Jersey.  The minor victims were as young as 12 years old at the time of the abuse.  In September 2024, Concepcion was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment. Urologist Darius Paduch Sentenced to Life in Prison for Sexual Abuse of Patients : In April 2023, the Office charged urologist Darius Paduch with sexually abusing male patients, including minors, while Paduch was employed at a major New York City hospital.  As alleged, beginning in at least 2015, Paduch sexually abused patients in his care, under the guise of providing medical treatment.  Paduch required victims to masturbate in his presence, often while viewing pornography alongside them.  He also insisted on masturbating victims himself, at times grabbing their genitals without warning.  Paduch further engaged in sexually explicit communications with certain victims, including sending messages that referenced his own genitalia and masturbation habits.  To perpetrate the abuse, Paduch directed victims to schedule follow-up appointments, to visit his office after regular business hours, and to see him outside the hospital setting.  Following a two-week jury trial, Paduch was convicted of 11 counts relating to his sexual abuse of seven victims, including five minor victims.  In November 2024, Paduch was sentenced to life in prison. Former Private School Teacher and Private Tutor Sentenced to 25 Years In Prison for Enticement of a Child and Possession of Child Pornography :   In April 2023, John Mueser, a private school teacher and private tutor, was sentenced to 25 years in prison following his conviction by a jury for inducing a 7-year-old minor whom he was tutoring to engage in sexually explicit conduct. Mueser’s phone was found to contain hundreds of images, many of which were sexually explicit, of his 7-year-old victim as well as numerous sexually explicit images and videos of other prepubescent children.  The Office’s investigation also revealed that, decades earlier, In November 2024, Paduch was sentenced to life in prison. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Former Obstetrician/Gynecologist Robert Hadden Convicted of Sexually Abusing Numerous Patients and Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison : In July 2023, Robert Hadden was sentenced to 20 years in prison following his conviction by a jury after a trial on charges for inducing victims to travel interstate to his medical offices in Manhattan so that he could sexually abuse them.  Hadden, who practiced medicine between in or about 1987 to 2012, sexually abused dozens of patients over the course of more than two decades under the guise of purported medical examinations.  To carry out the abuse, Hadden exploited the power differential inherent in the doctor-patient relationship, built rapport with victims, asked victims invasive and unprompted questions about their sexual activity, and conducted fake breast and vaginal exams. Former Bronx Public Charter School Teacher Pleads Guilty In Connection With Sexual Abuse Of Five Former Students :  In September 2023, Jesus Concepcion, a former teacher at a public charter school in the Bronx, pled guilty to a 10-count indictment charging him in connection with the sexual abuse of five minor victims who were also his students.  From 2000 until 2007, Concepcion abused his position as a teacher to induce and attempt to induce five of his students to engage in sexual acts by leading them to believe that they were in a romantic relationship with him.  Concepcion engaged in sexual acts with four of the victims at multiple locations, including the school, a motel in New Jersey, and his home in New Jersey.  The minor victims were as young as 12 years old at the time of the abuse.  In September 2024, Concepcion was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment. Urologist Darius Paduch Sentenced to Life in Prison for Sexual Abuse of Patients : In April 2023, the Office charged urologist Darius Paduch with sexually abusing male patients, including minors, while Paduch was employed at a major New York City hospital.  As alleged, beginning in at least 2015, Paduch sexually abused patients in his care, under the guise of providing medical treatment.  Paduch required victims to masturbate in his presence, often while viewing pornography alongside them.  He also insisted on masturbating victims himself, at times grabbing their genitals without warning.  Paduch further engaged in sexually explicit communications with certain victims, including sending messages that referenced his own genitalia and masturbation habits.  To perpetrate the abuse, Paduch directed victims to schedule follow-up appointments, to visit his office after regular business hours, and to see him outside the hospital setting.  Following a two-week jury trial, Paduch was convicted of 11 counts relating to his sexual abuse of seven victims, including five minor victims.  In November 2024, Paduch was sentenced to life in prison. Former Private School Teacher and Private Tutor Sentenced to 25 Years In Prison for Enticement of a Child and Possession of Child Pornography :   In April 2023, John Mueser, a private school teacher and private tutor, was sentenced to 25 years in prison following his conviction by a jury for inducing a 7-year-old minor whom he was tutoring to engage in sexually explicit conduct. Mueser’s phone was found to contain hundreds of images, many of which were sexually explicit, of his 7-year-old victim as well as numerous sexually explicit images and videos of other prepubescent children.  The Office’s investigation also revealed that, decades earlier, In November 2024, Paduch was sentenced to life in prison. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Drug Poisonings As deaths from opioid poisonings continue to increase, the Narcotics Unit has prioritized holding accountable those traffickers who sell narcotics resulting in the deaths of their customers, including the following: Federal Narcotics Offenses Charges for Four Defendants Running Fentanyl Operation from Bronx Daycare Center : Following the tragic fentanyl poisoning death of a one-year-old boy and the poisoning injuries suffered by three other young children, four defendants were charged with narcotics conspiracy offenses resulting in death, among other charges, for their role in operating a fentanyl distribution scheme inside a Bronx daycare center.  Federal investigators located fentanyl presses and kilograms of fentanyl hidden inside the day care facility.  All defendants pled guilty, and in October 2024, the leader of the conspiracy was sentenced to 45 years in prison . Leader of Drug Conspiracy Resulting in Eight Deaths Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison : In January 2025, Jesus Cabrera, a/k/a “Gee,” was sentenced to 30 years in prison for leading a drug trafficking organization that sold deadly fentanyl in the Bronx. Cabrera previously pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and fentanyl analogue, and to a related firearms count.  As part of his guilty plea, Cabrera admitted that the organization’s drug trafficking resulted in the August 2021 death of Malik Rahman, and that its product was recovered from the scenes of seven other fatal fentanyl poisonings in 2021. Dealer Of Fentanyl-Laced Heroin That Resulted In The Overdose Death Of Actor Michael K. Williams Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison : On or about September 5, 2021, in connection with a larger drug trafficking organization’s drug sales, Irvin Cartagena, a/k/a “Green Eyes,” sold Michael K. Williams heroin, which was laced with fentanyl and a fentanyl analogue.  Williams died as a result of using that fentanyl-laced heroin.  Despite knowing that Williams died after being sold the organization’s product, Cartagena and his co-conspirators continued to sell fentanyl-laced heroin in broad daylight amidst residential apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Cartagena fled to Puerto Rico after Williams’s death, where he was ultimately arrested in February 2022, later convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Leader Of Drug Delivery Service Responsible For Three Fentanyl Poisoning Deaths Sentenced To 30 Years In Prison : In March 2021, Billy Ortega mixed fentanyl into a weak batch of cocaine and sold it to at least five customers, who had no idea that they were receiving cocaine mixed with that deadly opioid.  In the course of a single day – March 17, 2021 – Ortega delivered, through one of his couriers, fentanyl-laced cocaine to three victims at three separate locations in Manhattan.  All three victims died after consuming the drugs distributed by Ortega.  After being convicted at trial, Ortega was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Leader of Drug Delivery Service Sentenced to 22 Years in Prison In Connection With Overdose Death : Ariel Tavarez, a/k/a “A,” a/k/a “Mike,” was sentenced to 22 years in prison in connection with his conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and a fentanyl analogue, and to distributing narcotics that caused the 2018 death of Colin Kroll, the co-founder of the video hosting service Vine and the trivia game application HQ Trivia.  Tavarez, who ran a drug delivery service called “Mike’s Candyshop,” stored heroin, cocaine, a fentanyl analogue, and cash from drug sales in various stash locations; sold only to customers who had been referred by existing customers; delivered narcotics directly to customers at locations specified by the customer; and used threats of violence, including with firearms, to maintain order and eliminate competition with his own drug organization. Fentanyl Trafficking As deaths from fentanyl and fentanyl analogues continue to spike, the Narcotics Unit has prioritized prosecutions of those trafficking in wholesale quantities of fentanyl, including the following: Charged International Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals Scheme with Victims in All 50 States : In September 2024, Francisco Alberto Lopez Reyes, a/k/a “Frank,” and 17 other defendants located in the United States, Dominican Republic, and India were charged for their involvement in a scheme to advertise, sell, manufacture, and ship millions of deadly pills disguised as legitimate pharmaceuticals.  These counterfeit pills were purchased by tens of thousands of victims from fake online pharmacies run by Lopez Reyes and his co-conspirators.  At least nine of those victims later died of narcotics poisoning.  Federal authorities seized nine website domains used by the defendants and their co-conspirators to sell counterfeit pills, four of which are named in the Indictment . Charged International Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals Scheme with Victims in All 50 States : In September 2024, Francisco Alberto Lopez Reyes, a/k/a “Frank,” and 17 other defendants located in the United States, Dominican Republic, and India were charged for their involvement in a scheme to advertise, sell, manufacture, and ship millions of deadly pills disguised as legitimate pharmaceuticals.  These counterfeit pills were purchased by tens of thousands of victims from fake online pharmacies run by Lopez Reyes and his co-conspirators.  At least nine of those victims later died of narcotics poisoning.  Federal authorities seized nine website domains used by the defendants and their co-conspirators to sell counterfeit pills, four of which are named in the Indictment . Fentanyl Traffickers Sentenced To Decades In Prison : In December 2022, Robert Shannon, a/k/a “Tank,” Kareem Roderique, a/k/a “Ernest Tucker,” was sentenced to 22 years in prison following his conviction at trial of narcotics conspiracy and firearms offenses.  Shannon faced trial after he and others were charged with running a large-scale narcotics operation out of a narcotics mill and stash house in East Orange, New Jersey.  Shannon and his co-defendants obtained large quantities of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine and utilized their stash house to mix, bag up, and prepare the drugs to sell to other drug dealers, who sold the drugs in the community.  The defendants also obtained and kept two loaded firearms in the stash house to protect their drugs and supplies. One Of The Largest-Ever Fentanyl Seizures In New York City : In October 2023, members of law enforcement investigating a network of drug traffickers executed a search warrant and found a Bronx home had been turned into a “mill” for the purpose of packaging large quantities of fentanyl into portions for wholesale distribution.  During their search, investigators found 24 kilograms of suspected fentanyl as well as over 200,000 suspected fentanyl pills already packaged and ready for distribution to other traffickers for further sale.  This seizure represents one of the single largest seizures of fentanyl in New York City history.  Some of the pills appear to have been manufactured to mimic prescription drugs, and others were pressed into colorful shapes to resemble party drugs such as ecstasy.  Four defendants have been charged with narcotics conspiracy for their role in maintaining the mill. Violence Associated with Drug Trafficking Because narcotics trafficking is often associated with those who commit or are willing to commit acts of violence, such as murder, robbery, extortion, and non-fatal shootings, the Narcotics Unit as well as Prosecutors in the Office’s White Plains Division bring prosecutions to address that violence, including through the use of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), including the following: Founding Member Of New York’s Largest Latin Kings Set Sentenced To 27 Years In Prison : In June 2023, Diego Mateo, a/k/a “Casa,” the highest-ranking member and founder of the Black Mob, a subset of the Latin Kings gang, was sentenced to 27 years in prison following his guilty plea to narcotics offenses.  For more than two decades before his arrest and prosecution by the Office, Mateo ran the largest and most violent set of the Latin Kings in the New York area.  He recruited hundreds of young men into his gang and used them to run a massive operation that committed countless acts of violence.  In total, the Office charged more than 20 members and associates of the Black Mob with racketeering offenses, narcotics conspiracy, and firearms offenses. Chappaqua Man Sentenced To 21 Years For Participating In A Gunpoint Robbery Of 176 Kilograms Of Cocaine And Smuggling A Firearm Into A Federal Prison : In September 2022, Deejay White was sentenced to 21 years for his participation in a dangerous gunpoint robbery of cocaine that left several victims injured.  Two victims were pistol-whipped and a third sustained serious injuries after jumping out of the apartment’s third-floor window in an attempt to flee to safety.  After he was arrested and in jail, White continued to commit crimes, devising a scheme to bring a loaded gun and drugs into federal prison, placing inmates, prison staff and court personnel in grave danger. Former High School Dean Convicted of 2010 Murder : In July 2023, Israel Garcia, a/k/a “Shorty Rock,” the former leader of the Get Money Gunnaz subset of the Young Gunnaz street gang (the “GMG YGz”), was convicted by a jury following trial of the 2010 murder of Alfonso “Joey” McClinton in aid of racketeering.  Garcia shot and killed McClinton on a residential street in the Bronx, New York, as part of a dispute over narcotics trafficking territory.  Garcia was also convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to distribute narcotics, murder while engaged in a narcotics conspiracy, murder through the use of a firearm, possessing firearms in connection with narcotics trafficking, and attempted witness tampering. Prosecution of Former Police Officer and others for Quadruple Homicide and Drug Trafficking : In March 2023, Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer turned drug dealer, was convicted by a jury of all 17 counts, including four counts that require a mandatory life sentence, following a four-week trial in White Plains.  In late 2015 and early 2016, Tartaglione invested approximately $200,000 in a cocaine deal whereby his associates would purchase multiple kilograms of cocaine in Texas, resell them in Florida, and continue to re-invest the profits in more cocaine.  In January 2016, one of Tartaglione’s associates, Martin Luna, reported that the $270,000 that was to be used to buy the next batch of cocaine had been stolen. Over the next several months, Tartaglione and his coconspirators mounted a pressure campaign against Luna to recover the money, but to no avail.  Suspecting that Luna had stolen the money himself, Tartaglione and his coconspirators lured Luna to a bar in Chester, New York, where Tartaglione would confront him.  Believing the trip was for legitimate construction work, Luna brought his two adult nephews and a close family friend.  Tartaglione tortured and strangled Martin Luna to death with a zip tie trying to recover the money.  The remaining three victims were brought to Tartaglione’s ranch where they were each shot in the back of the head execution style.  All four victims were buried in a mass grave. Prescription Drug Diversion The Narcotics Unit regularly brings prosecutions for the diversion of prescription narcotics, including Oxycodone and other opiates, by doctors, nurses, and companies, which is an egregious form of drug trafficking that is also an abuse of public trust, including the following: Manhattan Pain Management Doctor and Office Manager Sentenced for Oxycodone Diversion :  In March 2023, Howard Adelglass, a licensed physician who operated a pain-management clinic located in Midtown Manhattan, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison for a scheme in which Adelglass wrote thousands of prescriptions for large quantities of Oxycodone, many to individuals whom Adelglass knew did not need the pills for a legitimate medical purpose, in exchange for cash payments. With particularly vulnerable patients, Adelglass and his Office Manager and co-defendant solicited and, in some instances, received sex acts in exchange for illegal Oxycodone prescriptions. Yonkers Doctor Pleads Guilty To Illegal Distribution Of More Than 100,000 Oxycodone Pills : In January 2023, Marc Laruelle, a licensed doctor specializing in psychiatry, was sentenced to four years in prison following his conviction for prescribing more than 100,000 doses of Oxycodone without a legitimate medical purpose. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Combatting Local and National Narcotics Trafficking and Associated Violence, Financing, and Poisonings The Office is devoted to prosecuting narcotics-related offenses harming our communities locally, nationally, and internationally.  The Office’s Narcotics Unit works closely with its law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute narcotics traffickers fueling the opioid crisis through the distribution of fentanyl and its analogues; dealers who traffic in cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other controlled substances; and those involved in the illegal diversion and distribution of prescription painkillers.  Prosecutors in the Office’s White Plains Division also play a critical role in this area. As deaths from opioid poisonings continue to increase, the Narcotics Unit has prioritized holding accountable those traffickers who sell narcotics resulting in the deaths of their customers, including the following: Federal Narcotics Offenses Charges for Four Defendants Running Fentanyl Operation from Bronx Daycare Center : Following the tragic fentanyl poisoning death of a one-year-old boy and the poisoning injuries suffered by three other young children, four defendants were charged with narcotics conspiracy offenses resulting in death, among other charges, for their role in operating a fentanyl distribution scheme inside a Bronx daycare center.  Federal investigators located fentanyl presses and kilograms of fentanyl hidden inside the day care facility.  All defendants pled guilty, and in October 2024, the leader of the conspiracy was sentenced to 45 years in prison . Leader of Drug Conspiracy Resulting in Eight Deaths Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison : In January 2025, Jesus Cabrera, a/k/a “Gee,” was sentenced to 30 years in prison for leading a drug trafficking organization that sold deadly fentanyl in the Bronx. Cabrera previously pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and fentanyl analogue, and to a related firearms count.  As part of his guilty plea, Cabrera admitted that the organization’s drug trafficking resulted in the August 2021 death of Malik Rahman, and that its product was recovered from the scenes of seven other fatal fentanyl poisonings in 2021. Dealer Of Fentanyl-Laced Heroin That Resulted In The Overdose Death Of Actor Michael K. Williams Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison : On or about September 5, 2021, in connection with a larger drug trafficking organization’s drug sales, Irvin Cartagena, a/k/a “Green Eyes,” sold Michael K. Williams heroin, which was laced with fentanyl and a fentanyl analogue.  Williams died as a result of using that fentanyl-laced heroin.  Despite knowing that Williams died after being sold the organization’s product, Cartagena and his co-conspirators continued to sell fentanyl-laced heroin in broad daylight amidst residential apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Cartagena fled to Puerto Rico after Williams’s death, where he was ultimately arrested in February 2022, later convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Leader Of Drug Delivery Service Responsible For Three Fentanyl Poisoning Deaths Sentenced To 30 Years In Prison : In March 2021, Billy Ortega mixed fentanyl into a weak batch of cocaine and sold it to at least five customers, who had no idea that they were receiving cocaine mixed with that deadly opioid.  In the course of a single day – March 17, 2021 – Ortega delivered, through one of his couriers, fentanyl-laced cocaine to three victims at three separate locations in Manhattan.  All three victims died after consuming the drugs distributed by Ortega.  After being convicted at trial, Ortega was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Leader of Drug Delivery Service Sentenced to 22 Years in Prison In Connection With Overdose Death : Ariel Tavarez, a/k/a “A,” a/k/a “Mike,” was sentenced to 22 years in prison in connection with his conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and a fentanyl analogue, and to distributing narcotics that caused the 2018 death of Colin Kroll, the co-founder of the video hosting service Vine and the trivia game application HQ Trivia.  Tavarez, who ran a drug delivery service called “Mike’s Candyshop,” stored heroin, cocaine, a fentanyl analogue, and cash from drug sales in various stash locations; sold only to customers who had been referred by existing customers; delivered narcotics directly to customers at locations specified by the customer; and used threats of violence, including with firearms, to maintain order and eliminate competition with his own drug organization. As deaths from fentanyl and fentanyl analogues continue to spike, the Narcotics Unit has prioritized prosecutions of those trafficking in wholesale quantities of fentanyl, including the following: Charged International Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals Scheme with Victims in All 50 States : In September 2024, Francisco Alberto Lopez Reyes, a/k/a “Frank,” and 17 other defendants located in the United States, Dominican Republic, and India were charged for their involvement in a scheme to advertise, sell, manufacture, and ship millions of deadly pills disguised as legitimate pharmaceuticals.  These counterfeit pills were purchased by tens of thousands of victims from fake online pharmacies run by Lopez Reyes and his co-conspirators.  At least nine of those victims later died of narcotics poisoning.  Federal authorities seized nine website domains used by the defendants and their co-conspirators to sell counterfeit pills, four of which are named in the Indictment . Charged International Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals Scheme with Victims in All 50 States : In September 2024, Francisco Alberto Lopez Reyes, a/k/a “Frank,” and 17 other defendants located in the United States, Dominican Republic, and India were charged for their involvement in a scheme to advertise, sell, manufacture, and ship millions of deadly pills disguised as legitimate pharmaceuticals.  These counterfeit pills were purchased by tens of thousands of victims from fake online pharmacies run by Lopez Reyes and his co-conspirators.  At least nine of those victims later died of narcotics poisoning.  Federal authorities seized nine website domains used by the defendants and their co-conspirators to sell counterfeit pills, four of which are named in the Indictment . Fentanyl Traffickers Sentenced To Decades In Prison : In December 2022, Robert Shannon, a/k/a “Tank,” Kareem Roderique, a/k/a “Ernest Tucker,” was sentenced to 22 years in prison following his conviction at trial of narcotics conspiracy and firearms offenses.  Shannon faced trial after he and others were charged with running a large-scale narcotics operation out of a narcotics mill and stash house in East Orange, New Jersey.  Shannon and his co-defendants obtained large quantities of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine and utilized their stash house to mix, bag up, and prepare the drugs to sell to other drug dealers, who sold the drugs in the community.  The defendants also obtained and kept two loaded firearms in the stash house to protect their drugs and supplies. One Of The Largest-Ever Fentanyl Seizures In New York City : In October 2023, members of law enforcement investigating a network of drug traffickers executed a search warrant and found a Bronx home had been turned into a “mill” for the purpose of packaging large quantities of fentanyl into portions for wholesale distribution.  During their search, investigators found 24 kilograms of suspected fentanyl as well as over 200,000 suspected fentanyl pills already packaged and ready for distribution to other traffickers for further sale.  This seizure represents one of the single largest seizures of fentanyl in New York City history.  Some of the pills appear to have been manufactured to mimic prescription drugs, and others were pressed into colorful shapes to resemble party drugs such as ecstasy.  Four defendants have been charged with narcotics conspiracy for their role in maintaining the mill. Because narcotics trafficking is often associated with those who commit or are willing to commit acts of violence, such as murder, robbery, extortion, and non-fatal shootings, the Narcotics Unit as well as Prosecutors in the Office’s White Plains Division bring prosecutions to address that violence, including through the use of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), including the following: Founding Member Of New York’s Largest Latin Kings Set Sentenced To 27 Years In Prison : In June 2023, Diego Mateo, a/k/a “Casa,” the highest-ranking member and founder of the Black Mob, a subset of the Latin Kings gang, was sentenced to 27 years in prison following his guilty plea to narcotics offenses.  For more than two decades before his arrest and prosecution by the Office, Mateo ran the largest and most violent set of the Latin Kings in the New York area.  He recruited hundreds of young men into his gang and used them to run a massive operation that committed countless acts of violence.  In total, the Office charged more than 20 members and associates of the Black Mob with racketeering offenses, narcotics conspiracy, and firearms offenses. Chappaqua Man Sentenced To 21 Years For Participating In A Gunpoint Robbery Of 176 Kilograms Of Cocaine And Smuggling A Firearm Into A Federal Prison : In September 2022, Deejay White was sentenced to 21 years for his participation in a dangerous gunpoint robbery of cocaine that left several victims injured.  Two victims were pistol-whipped and a third sustained serious injuries after jumping out of the apartment’s third-floor window in an attempt to flee to safety.  After he was arrested and in jail, White continued to commit crimes, devising a scheme to bring a loaded gun and drugs into federal prison, placing inmates, prison staff and court personnel in grave danger.

Thwarting and Prosecuting Acts of Terror Prosecutors assigned to the Office’s National Security and International Narcotics Unit work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force and other law enforcement partners to investigate and thwart domestic and international terrorism threats, respond to terrorist attacks, and prosecute those responsible, including in the following significant terrorism cases: Perpetrator of October 31, 2017, Terrorist Attack in Tribeca Convicted at Trial and Sentenced to Multiple Life Sentences :  In January 2023, Sayfullo Saipov was convicted at trial of all counts related to his terrorist attack in lower Manhattan on Halloween 2017.  That day, Saipov rented a 6,000-pound truck and drove it from New Jersey to lower Manhattan, where he targeted a bike path and struck more than 20 people, killing eight.  The attack was the deadliest in New York City since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Saipov committed his attack to join ISIS, a brutal terrorist organization he had spent years learning about and supporting.  After his attack, Saipov boasted that he was proud of what he had done, asked to hang an ISIS flag in his hospital room, and expressed regret only that he had been unable to murder more innocent victims.  After the jury in Saipov’s capital trial was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to whether to impose the death penalty, Saipov was sentenced to eight consecutive life sentences, two concurrent life sentences, and 260 consecutive years in prison. Prosecution of Man Who Carried Out Machete Attack in Times Square on New Year’s Eve :  On December 31, 2022, Trevor Thomas Bickford traveled to Times Square for the purpose of killing U.S. officials in the name of radical Islamic jihad and used a machete-style knife to attack three NYPD officers working in coordination with the FBI to protect the New Year’s Eve celebration.  In January 2023, Bickford was charged with multiple counts of attempting to kill officers and employees of the U.S. Government and persons assisting them.  In January 2024, Bickford pled guilty to all counts, and he was sentenced to 27 years in prison in May 2024. U.S. Army Soldier Convicted of Attempting to Murder Fellow Service Members in Deadly Ambush :  In June 2022, former U.S. Army soldier Ethan Melzer pled guilty to terrorism and espionage crimes for attempting to orchestrate a deadly ambush of his fellow soldiers while stationed overseas.  Melzer was a member of the extremist organization Order of the Nine Angles or O9A, an occult-based, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist group, and Melzer joined the U.S. Army to infiltrate its ranks and further his goals as an O9A adherent.  While serving in the Army, Melzer planned an attack on his unit in the days leading up to a deployment to Turkey and sent sensitive details about the unit – including information about its location, movements, and security – to other O9A members for the purpose of executing the ambush.  The plot was foiled, and Melzer was arrested, shortly before his unit deployed to the site of the planned ambush. In March 2023, Melzer was sentenced to 45 years in prison for his traitorous crimes . Prosecution of Former Taliban Commander for Killing American Troops :  In October 2021, this Office unsealed charges against Haji Najibullah, a former Taliban commander responsible for commanding more than a thousand troops in Afghanistan and reporting directly to senior Taliban leadership.  Under his direction, Najibullah’s troops targeted and killed, among others, American and NATO troops and their Afghan allies, using automatic weapons, improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, and other anti-tank weapons.  In particular, Najibullah and his co-conspirators are charged with the November 2008 kidnapping of an American journalist and two Afghan nationals who were helping the journalist.  Najibullah and his co-conspirators held the victims hostage for months. Kidnappers of American Journalist in Somalia Convicted at Trial :  For 977 days, Michael Scott Moore, an American journalist, was held hostage in Somalia by pirates.  In February 2023, two key players in Moore's years-long captivity, Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed and Abdi Yusuf Hassan, were convicted after trial.  Tahlil, a Somali Army officer, left his post to take command of the pirates holding Moore captive and obtained the machine guns and grenade launchers used to threaten and hold Moore.  Hassan, the Minister of Interior and Security for the province in Somalia where Moore was held hostage, abused his government position and led the pirates' efforts to extort a massive ransom from Moore's mother.  Both defendants were sentenced to 30 years in prison in November 2024.

Belarusian Government Officials Charged with Aircraft Piracy for Diverting Ryanair Flight 4978 to Arrest Dissident Journalist :  While on its regularly-scheduled passenger route between Athens, Greece, and Vilnius, Lithuania, on May 23, 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 – which was carrying four U.S. nationals and more than 100 other passengers – was diverted to Minsk, Belarus, by air traffic control authorities in Belarus in response to a purported threat of a bomb on the plane.  There was, in fact, no bomb on board.  Belarusian government authorities fabricated the threat as a means to exercise control over the flight and force it to divert from its course and land in Minsk.  The purpose of the Belarusian government’s plot diverting the flight to Minsk was so that Belarusian security services could arrest a Belarusian journalist and political dissident, who was critical of the Belarusian government and living in exile in Lithuania.  The Belarusian government conspiracy to divert the flight was executed by, among others, officers of the Belarusian state security services working in coordination with senior officials of the Belarusian state air navigation authority.  The Office charged four of those Belarusian government officials, including the director of Belarus’s state air navigation authority, with aircraft piracy in January 2022, exposing the brazen scheme. Working closely with the DEA’s Special Operations Division and other law enforcement partners, prosecutors assigned to the Office’s National Security and International Narcotics Unit investigate and prosecute large-scale international narcotics and arms traffickers threatening national security and the corrupt foreign officials who facilitate their illicit activities. Prosecution of Former President of Honduras for Narco-Trafficking :  In April 2022, the former President of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, was extradited to face charges involving the transportation of massive quantities of cocaine and related firearms offenses.  As alleged in the indictment, Juan Orlando Hernandez worked with some of the largest and most violent drug cartels in the world to help them distribute tons of cocaine destined for the United States.  The charges against Juan Orlando Hernandez are some of the latest in the Office’s prosecution of large-scale narcotics traffickers and corrupt politicians in Honduras and elsewhere in the region.  The Office has previously secured convictions against others involved with Juan Orlando Hernandez in trafficking cocaine to the United States, including Juan Orlando Hernandez’s brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez Alvarado, himself a former Honduran Congressman who was convicted by the Office at trial and later sentenced to life in prison, and Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, a/k/a "El Tigre," the former chief of the Honduran National Police, who pled guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 25, 2024.  In March 2024, Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted on all counts after a three-week trial, and was sentenced to 45 years in prison in June 2024. Targeting the Sinaloa Cartel’s Fentanyl Operations :  In April 2023, the Office announced sweeping charges against Sinaloa Cartel leadership and 25 other defendants for conspiring to manufacture and transport staggering quantities of fentanyl made from Chinese chemicals into the United States.  Since at least 2014, the Mexico-based Sinaloa Cartel has run a global fentanyl manufacturing and distribution operation, sending massive quantities of fentanyl – a drug that has killed unprecedented numbers of Americans – into the United States.  The Office’s indictment charges not only Cartel leadership but also top lieutenants, manufacturers and distributors of the Cartel’s fentanyl, the managers of the violent armed security apparatus that protects the Cartel’s drug trafficking operations, the sophisticated money launderers who repatriate the Cartel’s drug proceeds back to Mexico, and multiple chemical precursor suppliers in China that fuel the Cartel’s fentanyl distribution operation. Chinese Chemical Company and Executives Charged with Fentanyl Trafficking, Precursor Importation, and Money Laundering :  In June 2023, the Office unsealed charges against the Chinese chemical company Hubei Amarvel Biotech Co., LTD., a/k/a “AmarvelBio,” (“Amarvel Biotech”) and three executives for their role in transporting more than 200 kilograms of raw chemicals used to make fentanyl and its analogues from China to the United States, intending that the chemicals would be used to produce fentanyl and its analogues in New York.  Amarvel Biotech and its executives agreed to continue supplying multi-ton shipments of fentanyl precursors despite being told that Americans had died after consuming fentanyl made from the chemicals they sold.  Two defendants, Qingzhou Wang, Amarvel Biotech’s principal executive, and Yiyi Chen, the company’s marketing manager, were arrested in June 2023. In January 2025, after a jury trial, Wang and Chen were found guilty of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering charges.  Multiple websites and cryptocurrency accounts, totaling approximately $900,000 in digital funds, were seized in connection with the scheme. Prosecution of Yakuza Leader and Affiliates for Large-Scale International Arms Trafficking :  In April 2022, working closely with our partners at DEA’s Special Operations Division, the Office charged Takeshi Ebisawa of Japan, a leader within the Japanese transnational organized crime syndicate known as Yakuza, and three Thai affiliates for conspiring to arrange large-scale international narcotics and weapons deals, including the acquisition of surface-to-air missiles.  The defendants were arrested, and their trafficking disrupted, after they traveled to Manhattan in April 2022.  On February 21, 2024, the Office unsealed new charges against Ebisawa for trafficking nuclear materials including uranium and weapons-grade plutonium, as part of the alleged scheme. Ebisawa pled guilty in January 2025 to the nuclear trafficking charges, as well as certain drug and weapons charges. Prosecution of Former President of Venezuela and High-Ranking Venezuelan Officials :  In March 2020, the Office unsealed narco-terrorism and related charges against Nicolas Maduro, the former President of Venezuela, and other high-ranking current and former Venezuelan officials, for their participation in decades of state-sponsored narco-trafficking.  The defendants sought not only to enrich themselves, but to weaponize their drug distribution and “flood” the United States with cocaine.  To date, two of the charged defendants have arrived in the United States to face charges.  The first, Cliver Antonio Alcala Cordones, is a former high-ranking general in the Venezuelan army who pled guilty in July 2023 and in April 2024 was sentenced to 260 months in prison . The second, Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, was extradited in July 2023 .  Carvajal Barrios is the former director of Venezuela’s military intelligence agency and, like Alcala Cordones, abused his government role to partner with narcotics producers and distributors to send tons of cocaine to the United States.  Trial against Carvajal Barrios is scheduled for June 2025. Cocaine Importation Charges Filed against Chief Superintendent of Royal Bahamas Police Force and Other Officials : In November 2024, working closely with our partners at DEA’s Special Operations Division, the Office unsealed an Indictment charging 13 defendants with cocaine importation and related weapons offenses in connection with their alleged participation in a massive cocaine importation conspiracy enabled by corrupt Bahamian government officials, including high-ranking members of the Royal Bahamas Police Force.  As alleged in the Indictment, drug traffickers have smuggled tons of cocaine through The Bahamas into the United States with the help and support of these and other corrupt Bahamian government officials.  Five defendants are currently in custody. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The principle mission of OPCL is to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people by reviewing and overseeing the Department’s privacy operations and ensuring its privacy compliance, including compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002; assisting the CPCLO in developing Departmental privacy policy and refining Department policies relating to the protection of civil liberties of individuals.

Securities and Commodities Fraud Prosecutions The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force continues its long tradition of leadership in the prosecution of securities and commodities fraud and other cases affecting the integrity of the financial markets. For example: Founder and Chief Executive of International Crypto Exchange Convicted of Masterminding a Multi-Billion-Dollar Fraud : On November 2, 2023, less than a year after the collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange that he founded, Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted at trial of masterminding a wide-ranging scheme to misappropriate billions of dollars of customer funds deposited with FTX and mislead investors and lenders to FTX and to Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s crypto hedge fund.  The proof at trial established that Bankman-Fried used billions of dollars of stolen FTX customer funds to pay for his personal luxuries, to make investments and millions of dollars of political contributions to federal political candidates and committees, and to repay billions of dollars in loans owed by Alameda.  Bankman-Fried also defrauded lenders to Alameda Research and equity investors in FTX by concealing his misuse of customer deposits in financial information that was provided to them.  On March 28, 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Former U.S. Congressman Convicted of Insider Trading : In March 2023, Stephen Buyer, a former Congressman from Indiana, was convicted at trial of multiple counts of securities fraud based on insider trading.  After leaving Congress, Buyer worked as consultant advising on confidential business transactions.  In 2018 and 2019, Buyer engaged in two separate, but interrelated insider trading schemes to steal material non-public information that he obtained through his consulting work and to use that stolen information to profit in the stock market.  In September 2023, Buyer was sentenced to 22 months in prison. Do Kwon Extradited To The United States From Montenegro To Face Charges Relating To Fraud Resulting In $40 Billion In Losses : Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, was charged with orchestrating schemes to defraud purchasers of Terraform cryptocurrencies. Kwon made false and misleading claims regarding the stability and efficacy of Terraform’s cryptocurrency stablecoin protocol, its use of blockchain technology, and its development of functioning and reliable financial technologies. As Kwon knew, however, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon had claimed. Rather, Kwon manipulated Terraform products to create the illusion of a functioning, stable, and decentralized financial system. Kwon’s conduct inflated the value of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies but ultimately contributed to the collapse of the crypto ecosystem, leaving investors and users with billions in losses. Kwon was extradited to the United States in January 2025, and is scheduled to stand trial in January 2026. Founder And Head Of Archegos Capital Management Bill Hwang Sentenced To 18 Years In Prison For Orchestrating Massive Market Manipulation And Fraud Schemes : In July 2024, Bill Hwang and Patrick Halligan were convicted following a nine-week jury trial of racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, market manipulation, and wire fraud. Hwang and Halligan ran Hwang’s private investment fund, Archegos, through a pattern of fraud and manipulation. Hwang used manipulative trading techniques to alter the prices of certain stocks in the marketplace and Hwang, Halligan, and their conspirators intentionally deceived Archegos’s trading counterparties to obtain margin loans and trading capacity, often by misrepresenting the composition and concentration of Archegos’s portfolio. The scheme collapsed in March 2021, causing billions of dollars in losses to market participants, Archegos’s trading counterparties, and innocent Archegos employees. Hwang was sentenced to 18 years in prison, and Halligan was sentenced to 8 years in prison. Celsius Founder And Former CEO Alexander Mashinsky Pleads Guilty To Multi-Billion Dollar Fraud And Market Manipulation Schemes : Alexander Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network LLC, was charged with securities fraud and commodities fraud in connection with a yearslong scheme to mislead customers and market participants regarding the market value and interest in Celsius’s proprietary crypto token CEL.  Mashinsky did so by manipulating the price of CEL through causing Celsius to spend hundreds of millions of dollars purchasing CEL in the open market with the objective of artificially supporting and inflating the price of CEL.  At various times during Mashinky’s tenure, Mashinsky and his co-conspirators also caused Celsius to use its own customer deposits to fund these market purchases of CEL in order to prop up CEL’s price, without disclosing this fact to Celsius’s customers.  Mashinsky pled guilty in December 2024, and will be sentenced in April 2025. Former Chief Investment Officer Of Global Bond Investment Firm Charged With Over $600 Million Investment Adviser Fraud : In November 2024, the Office charged Kenneth Leech II with defrauding clients of the investment-management company WAMCO by engaging in a $600-million criminal “cherry picking” scheme.  To compensate for losses in his marquee investment strategy, Leech assigned trades that performed well during their first day into client accounts associated with that investment strategy, and assigned trades that performed poorly over their first day into the accounts of other clients, who were not aware that Leech was causing them losses to favor others.  Leech’s victims included institutional and retail investors who trusted Leech to manage their savings and pension plans. Man Convicted For $110 Million Cryptocurrency Scheme : In April 2024, Avraham Eisenberg was convicted of commodities fraud, commodities market manipulation, and wire fraud in connection with the manipulation of Mango Markets decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. Eisenberg engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $110 million worth of cryptocurrency from Mango Markets and its customers by artificially manipulating the price of certain perpetual futures contracts. Eisenberg is scheduled to be sentenced in April 2025. Criminal Charges Filed in Multi-Year Fraud Scheme in the Market for Carbon Credits : In October 2024, the Office charged Kenneth Newcome and Tridip Goswami for participating in a scheme to commit fraud in the carbon markets, which resulted in their company, CQC Impact Investors LLC (“CQC”), fraudulently obtaining carbon credits worth tens of millions of dollars and fraudulently securing an investment of over $100 million. From at least in or about 2021, through 2023, Newbombe, the CEO of CQC, and Goswami, the Head of CQC’s Carbon & Sustainability Accounting Team (“CSAT”), along with others at CQC, including Jason Steele, the company’s Chief Operating Officer, submitted false and misleading data to the issuer of voluntary carbon units (“Issuer-1”), tricking Issuer-1 into giving CQC VCUs for emission reductions that, according to Issuer-1’s methodology for calculating such reductions, had not in fact been achieved. Members of the conspiracy manipulated data to make it appear as if certain of the carbon reduction projects were far more successful in reducing carbon emissions than was actually the case. British Investor And Billionaire Businessman Joseph Lewis Pleads Guilty To Insider Trading Scheme : In January 2024, Joseph Lewis, a billionaire businessman and investor, pled guilty to securities fraud.  Lewis controlled board of director seats at various companies and deputized employees to serve on the company boards.  Through these employees, Lewis received material, non-public information about the companies.  On multiple occasions over the course of several years, Lewis misused and misappropriated this confidential information to provide stock tips to various individuals, including his employees, romantic partners, and friends.  These individuals, in turn, traded on the tips provided by Lewis for vast personal gain.  In April 2024, Lewis was sentenced to three years’ probation and a $5 million fine. Complex Fraud Prosecutions The Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit as well as prosecutors assigned to the Office’s White Plains Division have pursued a wide range of significant fraud cases involving both individual and corporate defendants.  For example: Former NBA Players and Doctors Prosecuted For Defrauding the NBA Players’ Health and Welfare Benefit Plan :  In November 2023, former NBA players Ronald Glen Davis and William Bynum were convicted after trial for their roles in a prosecution charging more than 20 defendants in connection with a sprawling scheme to defraud the National Basketball Association Players' Health and Welfare Benefit Plan out of more than $5 million.  In August 2023, former NBA player Terrence Williams, the leader of the scheme, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Leaders of Multibillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency Scheme “OneCoin” Prosecuted :  In September 2023, Sebastian Greenwood, one of the co-founders of OneCoin, a fake cryptocurrency multi-level marketing scheme, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in stealing more than $4 billion from at least 3.5 million victims.  In 2019, Mark Scott, a former equity partner at international law firm Locke Lord LLP, was convicted at trial for his role in laundering hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud proceeds on behalf of the leadership of OneCoin.  In January 2024, Scott was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Ruja Ignatova, the co-founder of OneCoin, remains at large and was added to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Top Ten Most Wanted List in June 2022. Prosecution of Founders of AirBit Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme :  In September 2023, Pablo Renato Rodriguez and Gutemberg Dos Santos, the co-founders of AirBit Club, were each sentenced to 12 years in prison for orchestrating a massive global pyramid scheme.  Victims of the scheme were induced to invest in AirBit Club based on the false promise of guaranteed profits in exchange for cash investments in club “memberships.”  Promoters falsely promised Victims that AirBit Club earned returns on cryptocurrency mining and trading and that Victims would earn passive, guaranteed daily returns on any membership purchased.  Additional co-defendants have pled guilty and been sentenced. CEO of Paycheck Protection Program Lender Sentenced to 54 Months In Prison in First of Its Kind Prosecution for Fraud on the Small Business Administration :  In July 2023, Rafael Martinez was sentenced to 54 months in prison for his role in a scheme to submit fraudulent loan and lender applications related to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  Martinez was the CEO of MBE Capital, which fraudulently obtained more than $70 million in fees from the SBA after lying to the SBA and others to become certified as a PPP lender that issued loans totaling almost $1 billion.  Martinez is the first individual convicted of defrauding the SBA as a PPP lender. “Lottery Lawyer” Sentenced to 13 Years in Prison For Defrauding Lottery Winner Clients of More than $100 Million :  In June 2023, Jason Kurland, a partner at a New York law firm, was sentenced to 13 years in prison, following his conviction at trial on charges arising from a scheme to defraud lottery winners who had hired Kurland as their attorney of more than $100 million.  Kurland was charged alongside three co-conspirators, all of whom pled guilty to their crimes. Lawyers and Doctor Convicted for Roles in Massive Trip-and-Fall Fraud Scheme: In April 2023, George Constantine and Andrew Dowd, an attorney and an orthopedic surgeon, were each sentenced to 102 months in prison, after conviction at trial, for their role in a long-running conspiracy to defraud businesses and insurance companies by staging trip-and-fall accidents and filing fraudulent lawsuits arising from those staged accidents.  A third defendant, another attorney, pled guilty and was sentenced to 24 months in prison.  The defendants filed hundreds of fraudulent lawsuits, conducted hundreds of medically unnecessary surgeries, and attempted to defraud victims of more than $31 million. Prosecution of Danske Bank :  In December 2022, Danske Bank A/S, a global financial institution headquartered in Denmark, pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to conspiring to commit bank fraud and agreed to forfeit $2 billion to resolve the United States’ investigation into Danske Bank’s fraud on U.S. banks.  The guilty plea followed an investigation by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit, in conjunction with the Department of Justice. Between 2008 and 2016, Danske Bank defrauded U.S. banks regarding Danske Bank Estonia’s customers and anti-money laundering controls.  This fraud was designed to facilitate access to the U.S. financial system for Danske Bank Estonia’s high-risk customers, who resided outside of Estonia – including in Russia and who otherwise would not have been able to access U.S. banks. Multi-National Commodity Trading and Mining Firm Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Market Manipulation :  In May 2022, Glencore International A.G. and Glencore Ltd., both part of a multi-national commodity trading and mining firm headquartered in Switzerland, pled guilty to charges arising from more than a decade of criminal conduct, including bribery of public officials and commodity and price manipulation.  In connection with their guilty pleas, the Glencore entities agreed to pay more than $1.1 billion. Israel’s Largest Bank Admits to Conspiring with U.S. Taxpayers to Hide Assets Offshore :  In April 2020, Bank Hapoalim (Switzerland) Ltd., the Swiss subsidiary of Israel’s largest bank, pled guilty to criminal charges arising from its participation in a conspiracy with U.S. taxpayers to hide more than $7.6 billion in more than 5,500 secret Swiss and Israeli bank accounts, evading U.S. taxes.  At the same time, Bank Hapoalim B.M., the Israeli parent bank, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement.  As part of the resolution, Bank Hapoalim agreed to pay almost $875 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Prosecuting Fraud The Office prosecutes a wide variety of significant fraud cases involving both individual and corporate defendants, including frauds affecting the integrity of the financial markets. The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force continues its long tradition of leadership in the prosecution of securities and commodities fraud and other cases affecting the integrity of the financial markets.

A primary focus of our reentry efforts is to remove or reduce barriers to successful reentry, so that motivated individuals - who have served their time and paid their debt to society - are able to compete for a job, attain stable housing, support their children and their families, and contribute to their communities. Federal Interagency Reentry Council (FIRC) The FIRC, established by the Attorney General in January 2011, comprises 20 federal agencies representing a significant executive branch commitment to coordinating reentry efforts and advancing effective reentry policies. It is premised on the recognition that many federal agencies have a major stake in prisoner reentry. Learn more Reentry Issues Public Safety Reentry improves public safety.  Approximately two million adults are incarcerated in state prisons and local jails. Nationally, two out of every three people released from state prisons are rearrested for a new offense and about half are reincarcerated within three years. Reducing recidivism is critical for increasing long-term public safety and lowering corrections costs. Employment Individuals who have been incarcerated can expect their future earnings to be reduced by about 40 percent after they return to their communities.   Reentry efforts seek to reduce barriers to employment so that people with past criminal involvement – after they have been held accountable and paid their dues – can compete for work opportunities. Health There is often a lack of continuity in care from inside the prison to the community.  Reentry efforts can help ensure that the Affordable Care Act and other reforms will significantly increase access to appropriate physical and behavioral health interventions after release from incarceration. Substance abuse can be a significant impediment to successful reentry and a major health concern. Addressing the root causes of substance abuse leads to improved public safety. Education Education is a core resource for release preparation, and is an evidence-based tool for reducing recidivism among adults and juveniles. Participation in education programming was associated with a 16 percent reduction in recidivism in one study. Education is also a critical building block for increasing employment opportunities. Housing Stable housing with appropriate supportive services is a key factor in preventing homelessness and reducing recidivism.  The goal is to reduce barriers to public and subsidized housing, and advance promising models that improve outcomes for people who repeatedly use corrections and homeless services.

This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) provides guidelines for the cybersecurity research community and members of the general public (hereafter referred to as researchers) on conducting good faith vulnerability discovery activities directed at public facing DOJ websites and services.  This VDP also instructs researchers on how to submit discovered vulnerabilities [1] to the DOJ’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), within the Justice Management Division. Authorized Activities If a researcher complies with this policy in conducting vulnerability discovery activities, DOJ OCIO will consider those activities to be authorized. Overview Providing information and resources to the public and the law enforcement community constitutes a significant part of DOJ’s mission.  Many of those interactions with the public are now conducted online.  As such, DOJ’s information systems [2] play a critical role in supporting the Department and its component staffs as they execute their missions and safeguard American citizens.  Maintaining the security of DOJ’s systems and networks is the mission of the DOJ OCIO. DOJ OCIO recognizes that the cybersecurity research community regularly makes valuable contributions to the cybersecurity of individual organizations and the broader Internet.  DOJ OCIO recognizes that fostering a positive relationship with this community can help improve the Department’s own security. Vulnerabilities submitted to DOJ OCIO under this policy will be used for defensive purposes – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks and services, or those of our vendors. Researchers must review, understand, and abide by the following terms and conditions before conducting any research or testing on DOJ networks and before submitting a report. General Guidelines As described in more detail below, to be considered authorized activities under this policy, researchers must: Notify DOJ OCIO within 72 hours of discovering any real or potential security vulnerabilities. Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data. Only conduct testing activities to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use any exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data; open, take, or delete files; establish command line access and/or persistence; or pivot to other systems. Do not escalate privileges or attempt to move laterally within the network. Do not disrupt access to DOJ services or introduce any malware in the course of testing. Do not publicly disclose reported vulnerabilities without prior coordination with DOJ OCIO. Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports. Once a researcher establishes that a vulnerability exists, or encounters any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or the proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), they must stop testing, notify DOJ OCIO immediately through our vulnerability submission process, and not disclose this data to anyone else. Test Methods DOJ OCIO will deal in good faith with researchers who discover, test, and submit vulnerabilities or indicators of vulnerabilities in accordance with the following guidelines: Testing activities are limited exclusively to (1) Testing to detect a vulnerability or identify an indicator related to a vulnerability; [3] or (2) Sharing information with, or receiving information from, DOJ OCIO about a vulnerability or an indicator related to a vulnerability. Researchers may not harm any DOJ system or data on a DOJ system or exploit any potential vulnerabilities beyond the minimal amount of testing required to prove that a vulnerability exists or to identify an indicator related to a vulnerability. Researchers must not establish command line access and/or persistence; pivot to other systems; escalate privileges; attempt to move laterally within the network; disrupt access to DOJ services; or introduce any malware in the course of testing. Researchers must avoid intentionally accessing the content of any communications, data, or information transiting or stored on any DOJ information system – except to the extent that the information is directly related to a vulnerability and the access is necessary to prove that the vulnerability exists. Researchers must not intentionally exfiltrate or copy DOJ data, or open, take, or delete files. Should researchers obtain DOJ data during their research, they must coordinate with DOJ OCIO to ensure that data is appropriately destroyed upon confirmation that the vulnerability is remediated. Researchers may not intentionally compromise the privacy or safety of DOJ personnel (e.g. employees, contractors, or parties to ongoing investigations) or any third parties. Researchers may not intentionally compromise the intellectual property or other commercial or financial interests of any DOJ personnel or entities or any third parties through their research. Researchers may not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability, indicator of vulnerability, or the content of information rendered available by a vulnerability, until that vulnerability is remediated and they receive explicit written authorization from DOJ OCIO. Researchers may not conduct denial-of-service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that impair access to or damage a system or data. Researchers may not conduct physical testing or social engineering, including spear phishing, of DOJ personnel or contractors. Researchers may not intentionally submit a high-volume of low-quality, unsubstantiated, or false-positive reports. If at any point researchers are uncertain whether to continue testing, researchers must engage with DOJ OCIO at the email address provided below before conducting any further testing. Scope of Policy This policy applies to all DOJ-managed systems and services that are accessible from the Internet. This includes the registered domain name - DOJ.gov. If a researcher is unsure whether a system is in scope or not, contact DOJ at Responsible_Disclosure@usdoj.gov before starting any testing (or at the security contact for the system’s domain name listed in the .gov WHOIS ). Reporting a Vulnerability If a vulnerability is discovered, researchers must provide a detailed summary of the vulnerability, including the following: description of the vulnerability and its potential impact; product, version, and configuration of any software or hardware potentially impacted; step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue; proof-of-concept; and suggested mitigation or remediation actions, as appropriate. DOJ OCIO will accept vulnerability disclosure reports through the DOJ VDP Reporting Portal or by email. When submitting sensitive material, DOJ OCIO recommends encrypting the data. By submitting a report through the DOJ VDP Portal or communicating with DOJ OCIO at Responsible_Disclosure@usdoj.gov , DOJ OCIO will presume that the submitter read, understands, and agrees to the guidelines described in this policy, and consents to having any subsequent communications with DOJ stored on a U.S. Government information system.  Personal data submitted in a vulnerability disclosure report will not be retained by DOJ OCIO, other than contact information that will only be retained in order to coordinate with the researcher. By submitting a report or communicating with DOJ OCIO at Responsible_Disclosure@usdoj.gov, DOJ OCIO will presume that the submitter read, understands, and agrees to the guidelines described in this policy, and consents to having any subsequent communications with DOJ stored on a U.S. Government information system. Personal data submitted in a vulnerability disclosure report will not be retained by DOJ OCIO, other than contact information that will only be retained in order to coordinate with the researcher. If a researcher discovers a zero-day or any new vulnerability that may affect all users of a product or service and not solely the DOJ, DOJ OCIO may share a vulnerability disclosure report with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, where it will be handled under their coordinated vulnerability disclosure process . We will not share your name or contact information without your express permission. What You Can Expect From Us DOJ OCIO will take every disclosure report seriously and, to the extent it deems appropriate, investigate every report to validate the vulnerability, prioritize the risk, and ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate risk and remediate reported vulnerabilities. DOJ OCIO remains committed to coordinating with the security research community as openly and quickly as possible. This includes: Acknowledging receipt of each vulnerability report within three (3) business days. DOJ OCIO’s security team or its partners will investigate each report, and may contact the researcher for further information. Confirming the existence of the vulnerability to the researcher to the best of our ability and informing the researcher of any issues or challenges that may delay resolution.  If necessary, DOJ OCIO or its partners may coordinate with the researcher for additional information as we work to remediate a vulnerability. Maintaining an open dialogue with individual researchers to discuss issues. If researchers conduct vulnerability disclosure activities in accordance with the restrictions and guidelines set forth in this policy, (1) DOJ OCIO will not initiate or recommend any law enforcement or civil actions related to such activities, and (2) in the event of any law enforcement or civil action brought in connection with research activities, DOJ OCIO will take steps to make known that your activities were conducted pursuant to and in compliance with this policy. Activities Outside the Scope of this Policy DOJ does not authorize, permit, or otherwise allow (expressly or impliedly) any person, including any individual, group of individuals, consortium, partnership, or any other business or legal entity, to engage in any security research or vulnerability or threat disclosure activity on or affecting DOJ systems that is inconsistent with this policy or the law. If you engage in any activities that are inconsistent with this policy or other applicable law, you may be subject to criminal and/or civil liabilities. To the extent that any security research or vulnerability disclosure activity involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a non-DOJ entity (e.g., other Federal departments or agencies; State, local, or Tribal governments; private sector companies or persons; employees or personnel of any such entities; or any other such third party), those third parties may independently determine whether to pursue legal action or remedies related to such activities. This policy does not in any way limit the authority of the United States Attorneys or other components of the DOJ to pursue legal action.  Nor will actions taken in accordance with this policy shield an individual from prosecution for any previous or future violations of the law. Modification or Termination of this Policy DOJ may modify the terms of this policy or terminate the policy at any time. Questions Questions regarding this policy may be sent to Responsible_Disclosure@usdoj.gov . We also invite you to contact us with suggestions for improving this policy. [1] Per M-20-32, and consistent with 6 U.S.C. 1501(17), vulnerabilities described by this policy may be considered “security vulnerabilities” and are defined as a “[w]eakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.” [2] See definition in 6 U.S.C. 1501(9).

The original is kept at the National Archives in Washington D.C. On September 24, 1789, President George Washington signed into law the Judiciary Act, which marked the beginning of our national system of American law. Two days later, the President nominated Richard Harrison to become the first “United States Attorney for the New York District” in a handwritten letter to the Senate. On November 3, 1789, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York opened its courtroom in a market building located on Broad Street in Lower Manhattan, thirteen weeks before the Supreme Court held its first session. One of its first orders of business was to record Richard Harrison's commission as the United States Attorney for this District. By the spring of 1790, the United States Attorney's Office had successfully brought its first criminal and civil cases before a New York Federal court. Throughout its history, this Office has distinguished itself as one of the nation's premier legal institutions and spearheaded innovative federal litigation and law enforcement efforts. Because of this leadership role and a longstanding tradition of independence, incorruptibility, and dedication to the public interest, many accomplished men and women continue to seek to serve their country as Assistant United States Attorneys in the district. Transcript of President George Washington’s handwritten nomination. Over the years, the many men and women who have served in the Office have become leaders in government, in their communities, law schools, the bar, and on the bench. Southern District alumni have made enormous contributions in many of the nation's leading judicial tribunals - the United States Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals, the United States District Courts, the New York Court of Appeals, the New York State Supreme Courts, and others. In the private legal sector, major law firms carry the names of former Assistants, and are led by former Assistants. And, Office alumni frequently contribute to the political process as federal, state and local legislators and officials, and molders of the public administration and policy positions. Throughout its history and continuing today, SDNY prosecutors are guided by the tradition of excellence that is the hallmark of the Office. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, an early alumnus of the Office (1906-09), observed that no one beginning a legal career in the Office "could possibly have a more desirable, more deepening, and altogether more precious influence during their formative years." Justice Frankfurter's observations continue to ring true today. Assistant United States Attorneys have the opportunity to represent the interests of the United States of America and, in performing this important public service, to exercise responsibility that is unparalleled in any other job that a litigator might undertake. The excitement and pride inherent in being an Assistant United States Attorney resonate throughout the Office and are echoed every day by former Assistants who say it was the best job they have ever had.

Prosecution of Staten Island Man for Conspiracy to Commit Antisemitic Hate Crimes : In June 2022, the Office charged Saadah Masoud with federal hate crime and conspiracy offenses in connection with his assaults of three Jewish individuals in New York City in 2021 and 2022.  Masoud’s victims included a man who was wearing an Israeli flag, a man wearing clothing traditionally associated with the Jewish religion, including a yarmulke, and a man wearing a Star of David necklace.  Masoud pled guilty to conspiring to commit a federal hate crime and was sentenced on March 3, 2023, to 18 months in prison. Prosecution of Green Haven Prison Correction Officer :  In December 2022, the Office charged Taj Everly, a former correction officer at Green Haven Correctional Facility, in connection with Everly’s May 28, 2020, assault of an inmate at Green Haven.  At the time of the assault, Everly punched, tackled, and kneeled on the back of the victim, who was walking by as he returned to the cellblock after lunch.  Everly was charged with committing the assault under color of law and falsifying his report relating to the assault.  Everly pled guilty to depriving the victim of his constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  On September 27, 2023, Everly was sentenced to three months in prison. Green Haven Prison Correction Officer Convicted of Civil Rights Offense: In November 2021, the Office charged Aaron Finn, a former correction officer at Green Haven Correctional Facility in connection with Finn’s March 19, 2020, assault of an inmate at Green Haven.  During the assault, Finn used his body to press a handcuffed inmate face-first against a wall and then repeatedly struck the back of the inmate’s head, causing the inmate’s head to hit a cinder block wall.  Finn then repeatedly thrashed the inmate’s head against steel cell bars.  In July 2022, Finn pled guilty to violating the constitutional rights of the victim to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  On November 2, 2022, Finn was sentenced to three months in prison.

Prosecution of Armed Security Guard at 26 Federal Plaza for Forced Sexual Assault : In May 2023, the Office charged Jimmy Solano-Arias, a former armed security guard at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building located at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, with violating the constitutional rights of an asylum seeker by forcing the victim, through the threat of death or serious bodily injury, to perform oral sex on Solano-Arias while inside a locked office in 26 Federal Plaza.  On April 10, 2024, Solano-Arias pled guilty to lying to federal law enforcement agents following his sexual abuse of the victim.  As part of his guilty plea, Solano-Arias admitted that while acting under color of law as an armed security guard at 26 Federal Plaza, he engaged in a non-consensual sexual act with the victim.  In September 2024, Solano-Arias was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Kuwaiti Diplomat and Wife Charged With Forced Labor of Domestic Workers : In October 2022, Barrak Abdulmohsen Alhunaif, a former diplomatic attaché assigned to the Permanent Mission of the State of Kuwait to the United Nations in New York, and his wife, Khaledah Saad Aldhubaibi, were charged with forced labor, visa fraud, fraud in foreign labor contracting, and conspiracy to commit visa fraud and fraud in foreign labor contracting, in connection with their hiring and subsequent abuse of three domestic workers from India and the Philippines.  Alhunaif and Aldhubaibi remain at large, and the charges remain pending. Prosecution of Drug Enforcement Administration Task Force Officer : On August 2, 2023, Dustin Genco, a former DEA Task Force Officer, pled guilty to a misdemeanor information charging him with a violation of constitutional rights for assaulting an arrestee who was restrained in handcuffs.  As part of the plea agreement, Genco agreed not to work in law enforcement in the future.  On February 22, 2024, Genco was sentenced to three months in prison. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Javits Federal Office Building located at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, with violating the constitutional rights of an asylum seeker by forcing the victim, through the threat of death or serious bodily injury, to perform oral sex on Solano-Arias while inside a locked office in 26 Federal Plaza.  On April 10, 2024, Solano-Arias pled guilty to lying to federal law enforcement agents following his sexual abuse of the victim.  As part of his guilty plea, Solano-Arias admitted that while acting under color of law as an armed security guard at 26 Federal Plaza, he engaged in a non-consensual sexual act with the victim.  In September 2024, Solano-Arias was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.

Prosecution of Drug Enforcement Administration Task Force Officer : On August 2, 2023, Dustin Genco, a former DEA Task Force Officer, pled guilty to a misdemeanor information charging him with a violation of constitutional rights for assaulting an arrestee who was restrained in handcuffs.  As part of the plea agreement, Genco agreed not to work in law enforcement in the future.  On February 22, 2024, Genco was sentenced to three months in prison.

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “Since the commencement of our investigation in 2007, Westchester County Jail has worked steadily and in good faith to implement sweeping reforms that have significantly improved the treatment of inmates at the facility.  The Jail is a completely transformed institution, having implemented every provision of the agreement and even creating policies and programs that go beyond what the agreement requires.  At every step along the way, the Jail’s leadership and staff have been a willing partner in creating lasting reforms that have significantly improved the quality of life for inmates and detainees within the facility.  I commend Westchester County Jail for its efforts.” The Jail, located in Valhalla, New York, houses pretrial detainees and sentenced inmates.  The Jail also housed minors before the State of New York enacted “Raise the Age” in October 2018, prohibiting minors from being housed in adult corrections facilities.  The final minor housed in the Jail was transferred to a juvenile facility on November 8, 2019. The successful conclusion of the Agreement between the United States and the Jail resolves a long-running investigation into the Jail.  In 2009, the United States issued a letter setting forth the Government’s findings regarding constitutional violations at the Jail.  Key findings included that the Jail had failed to adequately protect inmates from physical harm caused by inappropriate and excessive force used by staff and failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care, particularly with respect to minors housed in isolation in the punitive segregation unit, all resulting in unconstitutional living conditions. Following extensive negotiations between the Government and Westchester County, on November 24, 2015, the parties entered into an Agreement with an effective date of January 1, 2016.  The Agreement contains 25 provisions with 82 sub-provisions relating to protection from harm, medical care, mental health care, and minors.  The Agreement requires the Jail to take measures designed to ensure that its use of force is not excessive and consistent with the law; to implement appropriate policies and practices concerning review of all uses of force, training of staff, and supervision of inmates; and to improve the provision of medical and mental health care for both minors and adults.  In addition, the Agreement mandates the appointment of an independent Monitor to assist the County in achieving compliance with the provisions of the Agreement, to make reports concerning the status and progress of compliance, and to provide the County with technical assistance to comply with the provisions of the Agreement.  Finally, the Agreement provides for termination once the United States agrees that the County is in substantial compliance with all provisions and has maintained substantial compliance with all provisions for 24 months. Since the Agreement was enacted, the United States and the Monitor have had full access to the Jail and its records, staff and inmates.  The Monitor has issued nine bi-annual compliance reports, reviewing the Jail’s non-, partial-, or substantial-compliance with each of the provisions in the Agreement, noting where the Jail has succeeded and where the Jail must improve.  In the ninth and most recent compliance report, the Monitor determined that the Jail had achieved substantial compliance with each and every provision, and had maintained such substantial compliance for at least a 24-month period.  Accordingly, consistent with the terms of the Agreement, the Monitor recommended its full termination. The Jail has been transformed since the initiation of the Government’s investigation.  For example, use of force incidents have plummeted and continued to decrease significantly each reporting period.  Indeed, potential use of force incidents are de-escalated and resolved without resorting to any use of force the vast majority of the time – recently, more than 80% of the time.  Moreover, staff are now consistently and routinely trained in de-escalation tactics; use of force incidents are immediately reviewed; and staff are swiftly disciplined for any deviation from reporting requirements and de-escalation procedures.  Mental health care and medical care has likewise improved dramatically, and the Jail has placed particular emphasis on rehabilitative care for inmates with mental health issues, instead of focusing on purely punitive measures. The Jail has also implemented changes beyond what was required by the Agreement.  For example, in a joint venture with Legal Aid of Westchester County, the Jail opened a Legal Aid office within the facility, allowing inmates frequent access to legal resources.  In addition, the Jail partnered with Westchester County Social Services to embed staff in the jail for discharge planning, which allows inmates to plan for their lives after being released from custody.  Indeed, the Jail has focused extensively on rehabilitation and reentry and provides a number of programming options to inmates, including culinary, civil engagement, and college programs, as well as a nationally-recognized parenting program, “Parenting, Prison and Pups,” which pairs female inmates with foster dogs and garnered a National Jefferson Award.  And on November 18, 2018, The Obama Foundation announced that Westchester County Jail, in partnership with the Nepperhan Community Center of Yonkers and the City of Yonkers, was selected as one of only ten nationwide winners – and the only one with ties to a jail or prison population – of the Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper Community Alliance Challenge as one of the National Impact Communities awardees for its job readiness program. The Jail’s leadership has been instrumental in making these changes.  Ms. Strauss praised the work of Westchester County Executive George Latimer, Westchester County Department of Corrections Commissioner Joseph Spano, Westchester County Department of Corrections First Deputy Commissioner Louis A. Molina, and the entire staff at Westchester County Jail.  Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss also praised the work of the Monitor, David Bogard, and his team at Pulitzer/Bogard & Associates. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ellen Blain is charge of the case.

Garcia, Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today that the United States has filed and simultaneously settled a counterclaim against TZUMI INNOVATIONS, LLC (“TZUMI”) for illegally distributing and selling millions of products claiming to have antimicrobial properties in violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  TZUMI sold these products without submitting them to EPA for registration, a mandatory process that allows EPA to assess the safety and effectiveness of the products.  TZUMI specifically targeted lower-income customers for sale of one of its products, “Wipe Out! Wipes.” The proposed stipulation and order of settlement (“settlement”) agreed to by TZUMI includes payment of a $1.5 million civil penalty, the largest FIFRA civil penalty ever obtained in a judicial settlement and one of the largest FIFRA penalties obtained by EPA in any context. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “At the height of the pandemic, Tzumi misled consumers and retailers and exposed the public to pesticide products that had not been found by EPA to be safe and effective.  It compounded matters by targeting low-income customers, who face disproportionate environmental burdens.  Today’s settlement ensures that Tzumi pays the price for its misconduct.  We will continue to pursue justice in environmental enforcement matters.” EPA Regional Administrator Lisa F. Garcia stated:  “Consumers must be provided accurate information about pesticide products and merchandise such as those items involved in this case, which must be properly labeled and registered with EPA to protect public health.  This settlement demonstrates EPA’s commitment to hold companies accountable that violate critical environmental laws and includes a provision where Tzumi Innovations, LLC will develop an extensive campaign to inform the public and retailers about the appropriate uses for the products in question.” The counterclaim filed in Manhattan federal court today alleges that in 2020, TZUMI began to sell three product lines—Wipe Out! Wipes, Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Wipes, and Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Decontaminant Spray—in an effort to respond to the public’s increased demand for disinfectant products during the COVID-19 public health crisis.  TZUMI expressly stated that it intended Wipe Out! Wipes to be sold to “lower income level customers.” None of these supposedly antimicrobial products were registered with EPA under FIFRA.  FIFRA prohibits the distribution or sale of pesticides—including products claiming to have antimicrobial properties intended to be used to disinfect surfaces—that are not registered under FIFRA, absent exceptions to registration not applicable here.  Registration is a critical step in ensuring the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial pesticides:  Among other things, during registration, EPA reviews the application information and performs a rigorous, comprehensive scientific assessment of the product, including the product’s active and inert ingredients and the proposed uses of the product, to ensure that the product is effective and has no unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used for its intended purpose and according to labeled directions. TZUMI failed to register the Wipe Out! products with EPA, even though its labeling made antimicrobial pesticidal claims suggesting that these products were intended to be used to disinfect surfaces and TZUMI had knowledge that the products would be used as a pesticide, as that term is defined in FIFRA.  Consistent with TZUMI’s claims, retailers then sold these products on their websites or in their physical stores in the same sections in which they included properly registered antimicrobial disinfectants, like Clorox and Lysol products.  Reviews on retailers’ websites demonstrate that consumers in fact were misled into believing that Wipe Out! Wipes in particular could be used as an antimicrobial pesticide to disinfect surfaces. TZUMI’s actions put the public—including the low-income consumers that TZUMI targeted—at risk of using products that failed to work as claimed or that were unsafe. Low-income communities in general bear a disproportionate burden of environmental exposures and public health risks, and selling unregistered pesticides to these communities raises particular concerns of environmental justice. *                *                * In the settlement lodged with the federal court today, TZUMI admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following, among other things: In 2020, Tzumi introduced new product lines to the domestic household market in an effort to respond to the public’s increased demand for disinfectant products during the COVID-19 public health crisis. The new products Tzumi distributed or sold included Wipe Out! Wipes, Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Wipes, and Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Decontaminant Spray. Wipe Out! Wipes, Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Wipes, and Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Decontaminant Spray have never been registered as pesticides with EPA under Section 3 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. § 136a. From at least August through December 2020, Tzumi distributed 4,895,184 units of Wipe Out! Wipes to Home Depot bearing a label stating on the front in part “Wipe Out Antibacterial Wipes” and “KILLS GERMS FAST*” and on the back in part “To decrease bacteria on the skin that could cause disease”; “Cleans and sanitizes”; “KILLS 99.9% OF GERMS*”; “*Escherichia Coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus Aureus (Staph), Candida Albicans”; and “Use it Anytime, Anywhere.” From October through November 2020, Tzumi sold 472,281 units of Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Wipes bearing a label that displayed the words “active ingredient” and “purpose: antibacterial” and graphics of household appliances, bathroom fixtures, and surfaces. From February 2021 through April 2021, Tzumi sold 62,796 units of Wipe Out! Multi-Surface Decontaminant Spray that stated on its label “Controls Algae Harmful Bacteria” (sic) and “… spray directly on the surface and let stand … ten minutes for antimicrobial response.” The settlement requires TZUMI to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and to issue corrective statements advising consumers and retailers of the unregistered status and limited appropriate use of the Wipe Out! products.  It also requires TZUMI not to distribute or sell such unregistered pesticide products in the future. The settlement remains subject to a period of public comment and Court approval.  Notice of the proposed settlement will be published in the Federal Register and the public will have the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed settlement for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval. U.S. Attorney Williams thanked EPA Region 2’s attorneys and program staff for their critical work on this case. This case is being handled by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Rovner is in charge of the case.

Prosecutors assigned to the Office’s Public Corruption Unit as well as prosecutors in the Office’s White Plains Division prioritize investigations and prosecutions involving the bribery of public officials, campaign finance violations and fundraising fraud, corruption of union officials, and fraud on the government.  Below are examples of cases charged within each of those priority categories. Bribery of Public Officials The Office investigates and prosecutes the payors and recipients of bribes to public officials at the federal, state, and local levels.  Recent examples include the following cases: U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, His Wife, And Three New Jersey Businessmen Charged with Bribery Offenses :  In Fall 2023, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, his wife Nadine Menendez, and three New Jersey businessmen named Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes were charged with bribery-related offenses.  The charges arose out of a years-long scheme through which, the indictment alleges, Hana, Uribe, and Daibes paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to the Menendezes, in exchange for Senator Menendez using his official position and influence, including as the Chairman and/or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for the personal benefit of these businessmen and to benefit the Governments of Egypt and Qatar.  Menendez, Hana, and Daibes were convicted in July 2024, following a nine-week jury trial.  On January 29, 2025, Menendez, Hana, and Daibes were sentenced to 11 years, more than eight years, and seven years in prison, respectively, for bribery, foreign agent, and obstruction of justice offenses.  Uribe pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing.  Trial for Nadine Menendez is scheduled to begin in March 2025. 70 Current and Former NYCHA Employees Charged with Bribery and Extortion Offenses : In February 2024, 70 current and former employees of the New York City Housing Authority ("NYCHA"), the largest public housing authority in the country, were charged with briber and extortion offenses.  The defendants are alleged to have demanded and received cash in exchange for NYCHA contracts by either requiring contractors to pay up front in order to be awarded the contracts or requiring payment after the contractor finished the work and needed a NYCHA employee to sign off on the completed job so the contractor could receive payment from NYCHA.  As alleged, the defendants typically demanded approximately 10% to 20% of the contract value - between $500 and $2,000 depending on the size of the contract - but some defendants demanded even higher amounts.  In total, these defendants allegedly demanded over $2 million in corrupt payments from contractors in exchange for awarding over $13 million worth of no-bid contracts. To date, 60 defendants have pled guilty and three defendants were convicted after trial. Two Former High-Ranking FDNY Officials Charged With Bribery, Corruption, And False Statements Offenses : In September 2024, two former chiefs of the New York City Fire Department  Bureau of Fire Prevention were charged with bribery, corruption, and false statements offenses.  The defendants are alleged to have repeatedly abused their positions of trust as high-ranking officials in the FDNY from at least in or about 2021 through in or about 2023 by soliciting and accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribe payments in exchange for providing preferential treatment to certain individuals and companies with matters pending before the Bureau of Fire Prevention. Both defendants pled guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Current and Former Metropolitan Correctional Center Employees And Inmates Indicted for Bribery, Contraband Smuggling, Narcotics Distribution, And Obstruction of Justice Offenses : In 2021, three former employees of the Bureau of Prisons at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) in Manhattan and eight former MCC inmates were charged with participating in an extensive bribery and contraband smuggling scheme.  The MCC employees smuggled contraband including drugs, cellphones, alcohol, and cigarettes and received bribes in exchange.  The inmates then allegedly sold the contraband to other MCC inmates.  All three MCC employees and six of the charged inmates have entered guilty pleas in connection with this case.  The two remaining inmate defendants were convicted after a jury trial in January 2024. In November 2024, one of the trial defendants was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment.  Sentencing for the remaining trial defendant is pending. Six Defendants Charged for Corruption at Rikers Island : In April 2024, six defendants, including three former correction officers, were charged with federal crimes for their involvement in corruption at Rikers Island. All six defendants have since pled guilty.  Five of the six defendants have been sentenced, with sentences ranging from 12 months’ to 40 months’ imprisonment. Campaign Finance Violations and Fundraising Fraud The Office also investigates and prosecutes individuals who violate federal campaign finance laws or engage in fraud through fundraising.  Recent examples include the following cases: Former Congressional Candidate Charged With Violating Campaign Finance Laws: In August 2024, Michelle Bond, who ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, was charged with conspiring to cause and causing unlawful campaign contributions in connection with her unsuccessful run for Congress in 2022.  Bond is alleged to have received illegal campaign contributions from her romantic partner and to have attempted to conceal their conduct by, among other things, making false statements to a congressional committee and the Federal Election Commission, and lying to her employer at that time. PAC Fundraiser And PAC Treasurer Charged With Multi-Year Schemes To Defraud Donors :  In 2023, Richard Zeitlin and Robert Piaro were charged with defrauding donors to political action committees (“PACs”) through misrepresentations regarding how the PACs would use the donations.  The charges allege that Zeitlin, who owns various telemarketing call centers and associated businesses that raised millions of dollars for PACs, engaged in a scheme to defraud donors by providing false information about how the donors’ money would be spent and misleadingly suggesting that donors were giving to charities instead of PACs.  Similarly, the charges allege that Piaro, who was the Treasurer of multiple PACs that raised millions of dollars in donations, made and authorized fraudulent claims about how his PACs had spent and would spend donor contributions.  Zeitlin is scheduled to begin trial in October 2024.  Piaro is scheduled to begin trial in January 2025. Zeitlin pled guilty and was sentenced to 121 months’ imprisonment.  Piaro pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Two Sentenced To Prison For ‘We Build the Wall’ Online Fundraising Fraud Scheme :  In July 2023, Timothy Shea was sentenced to 63 months in prison for his role in carrying out a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign known as “We Build the Wall.”  Two additional defendants were previously charged, convicted and sentenced to prison terms.  The defendants repeatedly and falsely assured their victims that donations would be used to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, when in fact the defendants and others stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds, which they used for personal expenses. Corruption of Union Officials The Office investigates and prosecutes officers and members of labor unions who engage in bribery or embezzle union funds.  Recent examples include the following cases: Former President And Former Financial Advisor Of Law Enforcement Union Convicted Of Defrauding Union’s Annuity Fund :  In May 2023, Kenneth Wynder, who served as president of the Law Enforcement Employees Benevolent Association (“LEEBA”), and Andrew Brown, who served as a financial advisor for LEEBA, were convicted at trial on charges that they embezzled and misappropriated money from union members’ retirement accounts.  As part of the scheme, Wynder and Brown made hundreds of thousands of dollars of fraudulent transfers from the retirement accounts for improper purposes, including for Wynder’s personal expenses and to pay one of Brown’s other clients.  Wynder also agreed with LEEBA’s Treasurer, Steven Whittick, to conceal Wynder’s income from the IRS and evade taxes.  Whittick pled guilty and was sentenced to more than two years in prison.  Wynder and Brown were convicted at trial and sentenced to 40 months and 18 months in prison, respectively. Leader Of Brooklyn Chapter Of The United Brotherhood Of Carpenters Convicted In Union Bribery Scheme :  In September 2021, Salvatore Tagliaferro, who served as President of the Local 926 chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, was sentenced to five years in prison following his conviction at trial for soliciting cash bribes from hundreds of prospective members in exchange for union membership.  As a result of the scheme, Tagliaferro received tens of thousands of dollars in bribe payments. Fraud on the Government The Office investigates and prosecutes recipients of government funds who engage in fraud or self-dealing.  Recent examples include the following cases: Seventeen New York City And State Employees Charged With Fraudulently Obtaining Pandemic Relief Loans :  In November 2022, 19 defendants, 17 of whom were government employees, were charged with submitting fraudulent applications for loans during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The defendants included seven employees of the New York City Police Department, three employees of the New York City Department of Education, two employees of the New York City Department of Correction, an employee of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, an employee of the New York City Department of Transportation, an employee of the New York City Administration for Children’s Services, and an employee of the New York City Human Resources Administration.  The charges allege that the defendants submitted fraudulent applications for funds under the U.S. SBA Paycheck Protection Program and/or Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, all of which contained false statements about the small businesses they claimed to operate, and which resulted in the theft of more than $1.5 million.  All of the charges have been resolved and the sentencings were held. Five Defendants Arrested For Stealing Millions From Government-Funded Childcare Programs for Low Income Families :  In 2023, Martin Handler, Menachem Lieberman, Harold Schwartz, Isidore Handler, Ben Werczberger, and Arie Rangott were charged for their respective roles in overlapping schemes to steal from and defraud daycares receiving funding from the New York City Administration for Children’s Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  Several of the defendants were also charged with obstructing related HHS investigations. Martin Handler, Menachem Lieberman, Harold Schwartz, Isidore Handler, and Ben Werczberger pled guilty.  Arie Rangott was convicted following a trial in July 2024. Handler, Handler, and Werczberger have been sentenced.  Lieberman, Schwartz, and Rangott are awaiting sentencing. Bronx District Leader And Board Of Elections Employee Charged With Bribery, Extortion, Fraud, And Identity Theft Offenses: Nicole Torres, an elected district leader in the Bronx and an employee of the New York City Board of Elections, was charged with illegally demanding payments from Bronx residents to herself and a local organization in exchange for selecting those individuals as poll workers.  Torres is also charged with falsifying documents to make it appear that certain individuals had worked as poll workers on particular dates, when, in truth and fact, they had not.  Torres and other members of the scheme then allegedly split the fraudulently obtained paychecks issued to the no‑show poll workers.  Trial for Torres is scheduled to begin in May 2025. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Holding Corrupt Public Officials Accountable The Office works, in close partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal, state, and city investigative agencies, to maintain and protect the integrity of all levels of government. Prosecutors assigned to the Office’s Public Corruption Unit as well as prosecutors in the Office’s White Plains Division prioritize investigations and prosecutions involving the bribery of public officials, campaign finance violations and fundraising fraud, corruption of union officials, and fraud on the government.  Below are examples of cases charged within each of those priority categories.

The Office also investigates and prosecutes individuals who violate federal campaign finance laws or engage in fraud through fundraising.  Recent examples include the following cases: Former Congressional Candidate Charged With Violating Campaign Finance Laws: In August 2024, Michelle Bond, who ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, was charged with conspiring to cause and causing unlawful campaign contributions in connection with her unsuccessful run for Congress in 2022.  Bond is alleged to have received illegal campaign contributions from her romantic partner and to have attempted to conceal their conduct by, among other things, making false statements to a congressional committee and the Federal Election Commission, and lying to her employer at that time. PAC Fundraiser And PAC Treasurer Charged With Multi-Year Schemes To Defraud Donors :  In 2023, Richard Zeitlin and Robert Piaro were charged with defrauding donors to political action committees (“PACs”) through misrepresentations regarding how the PACs would use the donations.  The charges allege that Zeitlin, who owns various telemarketing call centers and associated businesses that raised millions of dollars for PACs, engaged in a scheme to defraud donors by providing false information about how the donors’ money would be spent and misleadingly suggesting that donors were giving to charities instead of PACs.  Similarly, the charges allege that Piaro, who was the Treasurer of multiple PACs that raised millions of dollars in donations, made and authorized fraudulent claims about how his PACs had spent and would spend donor contributions.  Zeitlin is scheduled to begin trial in October 2024.  Piaro is scheduled to begin trial in January 2025. Zeitlin pled guilty and was sentenced to 121 months’ imprisonment.  Piaro pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Two Sentenced To Prison For ‘We Build the Wall’ Online Fundraising Fraud Scheme :  In July 2023, Timothy Shea was sentenced to 63 months in prison for his role in carrying out a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign known as “We Build the Wall.”  Two additional defendants were previously charged, convicted and sentenced to prison terms.  The defendants repeatedly and falsely assured their victims that donations would be used to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, when in fact the defendants and others stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds, which they used for personal expenses. The Office investigates and prosecutes officers and members of labor unions who engage in bribery or embezzle union funds.  Recent examples include the following cases: Former President And Former Financial Advisor Of Law Enforcement Union Convicted Of Defrauding Union’s Annuity Fund :  In May 2023, Kenneth Wynder, who served as president of the Law Enforcement Employees Benevolent Association (“LEEBA”), and Andrew Brown, who served as a financial advisor for LEEBA, were convicted at trial on charges that they embezzled and misappropriated money from union members’ retirement accounts.  As part of the scheme, Wynder and Brown made hundreds of thousands of dollars of fraudulent transfers from the retirement accounts for improper purposes, including for Wynder’s personal expenses and to pay one of Brown’s other clients.  Wynder also agreed with LEEBA’s Treasurer, Steven Whittick, to conceal Wynder’s income from the IRS and evade taxes.  Whittick pled guilty and was sentenced to more than two years in prison.  Wynder and Brown were convicted at trial and sentenced to 40 months and 18 months in prison, respectively. Leader Of Brooklyn Chapter Of The United Brotherhood Of Carpenters Convicted In Union Bribery Scheme :  In September 2021, Salvatore Tagliaferro, who served as President of the Local 926 chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, was sentenced to five years in prison following his conviction at trial for soliciting cash bribes from hundreds of prospective members in exchange for union membership.  As a result of the scheme, Tagliaferro received tens of thousands of dollars in bribe payments. The Office investigates and prosecutes recipients of government funds who engage in fraud or self-dealing.  Recent examples include the following cases: Seventeen New York City And State Employees Charged With Fraudulently Obtaining Pandemic Relief Loans :  In November 2022, 19 defendants, 17 of whom were government employees, were charged with submitting fraudulent applications for loans during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The defendants included seven employees of the New York City Police Department, three employees of the New York City Department of Education, two employees of the New York City Department of Correction, an employee of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, an employee of the New York City Department of Transportation, an employee of the New York City Administration for Children’s Services, and an employee of the New York City Human Resources Administration.  The charges allege that the defendants submitted fraudulent applications for funds under the U.S. SBA Paycheck Protection Program and/or Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, all of which contained false statements about the small businesses they claimed to operate, and which resulted in the theft of more than $1.5 million.  All of the charges have been resolved and the sentencings were held. Five Defendants Arrested For Stealing Millions From Government-Funded Childcare Programs for Low Income Families :  In 2023, Martin Handler, Menachem Lieberman, Harold Schwartz, Isidore Handler, Ben Werczberger, and Arie Rangott were charged for their respective roles in overlapping schemes to steal from and defraud daycares receiving funding from the New York City Administration for Children’s Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  Several of the defendants were also charged with obstructing related HHS investigations. Martin Handler, Menachem Lieberman, Harold Schwartz, Isidore Handler, and Ben Werczberger pled guilty.  Arie Rangott was convicted following a trial in July 2024. Handler, Handler, and Werczberger have been sentenced.  Lieberman, Schwartz, and Rangott are awaiting sentencing. Bronx District Leader And Board Of Elections Employee Charged With Bribery, Extortion, Fraud, And Identity Theft Offenses: Nicole Torres, an elected district leader in the Bronx and an employee of the New York City Board of Elections, was charged with illegally demanding payments from Bronx residents to herself and a local organization in exchange for selecting those individuals as poll workers.  Torres is also charged with falsifying documents to make it appear that certain individuals had worked as poll workers on particular dates, when, in truth and fact, they had not.  Torres and other members of the scheme then allegedly split the fraudulently obtained paychecks issued to the no‑show poll workers.  Trial for Torres is scheduled to begin in May 2025. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Charges Against Two Iranian Nationals For Cyber-Enabled Disinformation And Threat Campaign Designed To Interfere With The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election :  In November 2021, the Office unsealed an indictment charging Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian, two Iranian citizens and residents, for their involvement in a cyber-enabled campaign to intimidate and influence American voters, and otherwise undermine voter confidence and sow discord, in connection with the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.  As part of this campaign, the conspirators obtained confidential United States voter information from at least one state election website, sent threatening email messages to intimidate voters, created and disseminated a video containing disinformation pertaining to purported but non-existent voting vulnerabilities, attempted to access, without authorization, several states’ voting-related websites, and successfully gained unauthorized access to a U.S. media company’s computer network that, if not for successful Federal Bureau of Investigation and victim company efforts to mitigate, would have provided the conspirators another vehicle for further disseminating false claims after the election. Minnesota Man Sentenced To Three Years In Prison For Scheme To Commit Computer Intrusion And To Illegally Stream Content From Four Major Professional Sports Leagues :  In March 2023, Joshua Streit was sentenced to three years in prison for conducting intrusions into Major League Baseball (“MLB”) computer systems and illegally streaming copyrighted content from MLB, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, and the National Hockey League on a website that the defendant operated, which offered the illegally streamed content to the public for profit.  In addition, at the same time the defendant was illicitly streaming copyrighted content from MLB, the defendant engaged in an attempt to extort approximately $150,000 from MLB via a threat from the defendant to publicize unrelated vulnerabilities in MLB’s internet infrastructure. Two Men Charged For Conspiring With Russian Nationals To Hack The Taxi Dispatch System At JFK Airport :  In December 2022, the Office arrested Daniel Abayev and Peter Leyman for two counts of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions in connection with their hack of the electronic taxi dispatch system (the “Dispatch System”) at John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”).  Taxi drivers are required to wait in a holding lot at JFK before they are dispatched to pick up a fare.  A computer system ensures that taxis are dispatched in the order in which they arrived.  The defendants conspired with Russian nationals, Alexsandr Derebenetc and Kirill Shipulin, who were charged in October 2023 , to hack the Dispatch System and move certain taxis to the front of the line, in exchange for payment.  Abayev and Leyman have both pled guilty and were sentenced to four years and two years in prison, respectively, in February 2024. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

As a new employee, you are eligible for several benefits and will need to make decisions on these benefits, usually within 60 days of your appointment. Enrollment forms are provided for your use and may be completed and returned to us during new employee orientation. Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/life-insurance http://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf2817.pdf If you are new to the Federal government or have had a break in service of more than 180 days, you will be automatically enrolled in FEGLI's Basic life insurance coverage. Your Basic coverage amount is your annual salary rounded up to the next thousand dollars, plus two thousand. You will also be eligible to elect within 60 days of your appointment date, Option A (Standard) which adds $10,000 to your Basic coverage amount; Option B (Additional) increases your coverage by up to 5 multiples of your salary; and Option C (Family) which allows you to insure your spouse and children for up to 5 multiples of $5,000 and $2,500, respectively. If you decide that you do not want to enroll in Basic coverage and/or any of the options, you will then only be able to elect coverage if you either experience a life event, such as getting married or birth of a child, or undergo a physical (at your own expense) after a waiting period of at least 52 weeks from the date you declined coverage. Federal Employees' Health Benefits Program (FEHB) http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare SF2809.pdf As a new Federal employee, you have 60 days from your appointment date to elect a health plan. Available plans include nationwide plans, health funds with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Coverage is effective the first day of the pay period following our receipt of your completed SF-2809 election form. Should you not elect coverage within this initial 60 day period, you must then wait for "open season," a period in November-December in which you may elect coverage, change your existing coverage, or cancel your coverage. Elections made during open season, are effective the first day of the first full pay period in January of the following year. You may also be able to make changes to your coverage if you experience a qualifying life event. The government pays a portion of your premium and the part of the premium which you pay is a pre-tax deduction from your salary check. For family coverage, you must provide documentation verifying each family member’s relation to you. You are required to provide a copy of your marriage certificate for a spouse. If you have been married for over a  year, you additionally must provide a most recent joint tax return, a shared utility bill, or, a shared bank statement. For eligible dependent children, you must provide a birth or final adoption certificate. Federal Employees' Dental and Vision Program (FEDVIP) http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/dental-vision/ If you are new to the government and eligible for FEHB (you need not be enrolled), you can elect supplemental dental and/or vision care by self-enrolling at www.fsafeds.com . You must enroll within 60 days of your appointment date. Pre-tax premiums will be deducted from your salary check and there is no government contribution to these premiums. If you do not enroll during this period, you can enroll during the annual open season or through a qualifying life event. You may make changes to your coverage during open season or through a qualifying life event. Employees transferring need only contact Benefeds to notify them of your change of agency. Transferring employees not currently enrolled in FEDVIP must wait for open season to elect coverage. Retirement (FERS) http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/ The vast majority of employees are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) which provides a monthly benefit to retirees who have met the eligibility requirements for retirement. The amount of the benefit is computed using a formula based on length of Federal service and the average salary computed over the highest three years of consecutive service. FERS is a defined contribution plan where the FERS annuity is supplemented by Social Security (FICA) and the Thrift Savings Plan to provide a complete retirement benefit. Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) https://www.tsp.gov/ https://www.tsp.gov/forms/tsp-1.pdf Similar to a 401K plan, and in addition to your pension and Social Security, TSP offers employees the ability to save either pre-tax (Traditional TSP) or post-tax (Roth TSP) dollars from your salary check. New employees are automatically enrolled in the TSP at a contribution rate of 5%. TSP is comprised of 5 funds-Government Securities (G); Bonds (F); Large Cap Stocks (C); Small Cap Stocks (S); and International Stocks (I). You can invest in 1 fund or all of them. You have the option of investing in the "L" funds which are portfolios already created for various retirement goal years and each portfolio invests in all 5 funds. As you get closer to your goal year, your portfolio will realign the percentages invested in each fund to lower your risk. You can start, stop, and restart your TSP contributions at any time. You can also raise and lower your contributions as well. Additionally, the government matches the first 3% contributed by FERS employees dollar-for-dollar; 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2%; and provides a 1% automatic contribution to your account regardless of your whether you contribute or not. You can designate a contribution rate percentage or dollar amount by submitting the TSP-1 form. If you are 50 years of age or older, you can make additional "catch-up" contributions directly adding the dollar amount to your total contribution to meet the maximum allowable contribution for the year. Once your account has been established, TSP will send you a welcome letter containing your TSP account number. This account number and the password you create will allow you access to your personal account information at www.tsp.gov . Initially, your contributions will be invested in the L Funds, based on your year of birth, until you make a different choice. Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) https://www.fsafeds.com/GEM New Federal employees have 60 days from their appointment date (but no later than September 30) to enroll in a Health Care and/or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account at www.fsafeds.com . Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to pay for eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars. There are 3 types of FSAs-Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) which can be used to pay for qualified medical costs and health care expenses that are not paid by your FEHB plan or any other insurance; Limited Expense Health Care Flexible Spending Account (LEX HCFSA) is available only to those who enroll in a FEHB program High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA) and eligible expenses are limited to dental and vision care services/products that meet the IRS definition of medical care; Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) is used to pay for eligible dependent care expenses such as child care for children under age 13 or day care for anyone who you claim as a dependent on your Federal tax return who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care so that you (and your spouse) can work. Unlike other Federal benefits, you must enroll annually in order to participate from one year to the next. Federal Long Term Care Insurance (LTC) http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/long-term-care/ http://www.ltcfeds.com/ Long term care is care that you need if you can no longer perform everyday tasks (activities of daily living) by yourself due to chronic illness, injury, disability, or the aging process. You can select coverage for nursing home care, home care, hospice, etc., which can be expensive if you have to pay out-of-pocket. If you are a new Federal employee and apply within the 60 days of your appointment date, you can use the abbreviated underwriting application which asks limited health-related questions. All employees can apply after this period, but will have to use the full underwriting application. Qualified relatives are also eligible to apply for coverage and they include your spouse, parents, in-laws, stepparents, adult children and same-sex domestic partners. The government does not provide any contributions to the cost of long term care insurance. Transit Subsidy Transit Subsidy Form.pdf All employees are eligible for a transit subsidy which provides a monthly stipend through the use of a debit card to purchase a MetroCard or other transportation voucher.

The Justice Grants System (JustGrants) The Justice Grants System (JustGrants) is the Department of Justice's grants management system for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW).

Visit the DOJ Program Plan DOJ Grant Agency Sites Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) is responsible for advancing the practice of community policing by the nation's state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources. The COPS Office awards grants to hire community policing professionals, develop and test innovative policing strategies, and provide training and technical assistance to community members, local government leaders, and all levels of law enforcement. COPS Grants Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) provides innovative leadership to federal, state, local, and tribal justice systems, by disseminating state-of-the art knowledge and practices across America, and providing grants for the implementation of these crime fighting strategies. Because most of the responsibility for crime control and prevention falls to law enforcement officers in states, cities, and neighborhoods, the federal government can be effective in these areas only to the extent that it can enter into partnerships with these officers. Therefore, OJP does not directly carry out law enforcement and justice activities. Instead, OJP works in partnership with the justice community to identify the most pressing crime-related challenges confronting the justice system and to provide information, training, coordination, and innovative strategies and approaches for addressing these challenges. OJP’s goals are to strengthen partnerships with state, local and tribal stakeholders; ensure integrity of, and respect for, science - including a focus on evidence-based, "smart on crime" approaches in criminal and juvenile justice; and administer OJP’s grant awards process in a fair, accessible and transparent fashion - and, as good stewards of federal funds, manage the grants system in a manner that avoids waste, fraud and abuse.

OVW Grant Programs Build America, Buy America (BABA) The Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act (Pub. L. No. 117-58, §§ 70901-52) , enacted as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on November 15, 2021, requires that “none of the funds made available for a Federal financial assistance program for infrastructure, including each deficient program, may be obligated for a project unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States.” (Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act, P.L. 117-58, Secs 70911 – 70917).

Title III of the ADA requires that privately owned places of public accommodation, including colleges and universities, remove physical barriers to access to existing facilities where it is readily achievable to do so, comply with accessibility standards for new construction and alterations, and modify policies and practices where necessary to ensure full and equal enjoyment of services and facilities. The out-of-court agreement resolves a compliance review during which the U.S. Attorney’s Office identified various aspects of NYU’s student housing facilities that were not in compliance with Title III of the ADA and the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, including violations of the new construction provisions of the ADA and barriers to access to existing facilities. NYU’s New York-area campuses include student housing facilities in Manhattan, in Brooklyn, and on Long Island for the University’s undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools.  The agreement covers a total of more than 4,000 student housing units, which are located within 22 NYU-owned student housing facilities and 10 facilities leased in full or in part by the University. NYU has agreed to prepare a plan under which it will survey and make alterations to its student housing facilities within five years, update its student housing emergency preparedness plans, and improve the accessibility information related to student housing on its website. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “The ADA requires colleges and universities to ensure that no individual is discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of their services and facilities.  We are pleased that NYU has committed to improving accessibility within the University’s student housing facilities and hope that other colleges and universities will follow suit and increase access to their facilities for individuals with disabilities.” Under the agreement, NYU will: Conduct architectural surveys and seek public comment from the University community and then submit an accessibility plan for review to this Office, outlining how the University will comply with the agreement. Ensure that an appropriate number of accessible student housing units (and bathrooms serving those units) are available to students with disabilities and are dispersed throughout the University’s student housing facilities which serve NYU’s (i) general student population, (ii) graduate student population, (iii) Grossman School of Medicine, (iv) Long Island School of Medicine, (v) law school, and (vi) Brooklyn campus. Ensure that each student housing facility in which accessible housing units required by the agreement are located has accessible features, including accessible entrances, approaches, bathrooms, and signage; and that an appropriate number of additional housing facilities have an accessible entrance, first floor common area, and bathroom. Update its student housing emergency evacuation, sheltering, and shelter-in-place plans for individuals with disabilities after seeking public comment from the University community. Update its website to identify accessible entrances, routes, and transportation options for its student housing facilities; identify newly added or renovated accessible features of the student housing facilities; and provide information to assist students and prospective students with disabilities in securing and utilizing accessible housing and housing accommodations at NYU. *                *                * This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger is in charge of the case.

Hunter College to Pay $200,000 and Admits to Using NIH Funds to Pay Parsons’ Staff for Time Spent Working on Projects Unrelated to the NIH Grants. Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the United States has filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against HUNTER COLLEGE (“HUNTER”) and JEFFREY T. PARSONS-HIETIKKO (“PARSONS”), a former HUNTER psychology professor who served as Director of Hunter’s Center for HIV Educational Studies (“CHEST”).  The lawsuit resolves the United States’ allegations that for many years: (i) PARSONS improperly invoiced personal expenses to National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) funds, including expenses related to scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, a tropical birthday celebration, and travel for his work as a private consultant; (ii)  HUNTER used NIH funds to pay PARSONS over $90,000 in retention bonuses without disclosing these payments to NIH as required; and (iii) PARSONS and HUNTER submitted false timekeeping records that misrepresented the time that CHEST staff spent working on NIH grant-related projects, resulting in the use of NIH grant funds to compensate CHEST staff for work performed for private clients.  The lawsuit alleges that these impermissible uses of NIH funds violated HUNTER’s certifications to NIH and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that the NIH funds would be used only for allowable research and academic purposes. Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, PARSONS, 55, of Teaneck, New Jersey, and HUNTER agreed to pay $375,000 and $200,000, respectively, to the United States and made detailed factual admissions regarding their conduct. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “NIH provides funding to academic institutions for the purpose of furthering important research that impacts communities and improves lives.  For years, Jeffrey Parsons-Hietikko obtained these funds under false pretenses, then used them to cover his personal expenses and for other purposes totally unrelated to research.  Hunter College improperly used NIH funds to pay undisclosed bonuses to Parsons and for other expenses unrelated to NIH-funded work.  When individuals and institutions abuse federal grant money, this Office will hold them accountable.” As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: During his time at HUNTER, where he was promoted on multiple occasions and achieved the status of Distinguished Professor in 2012, PARSONS proved himself to be singularly proficient at obtaining NIH funding to support his and CHEST’s research.  HUNTER considered PARSONS to be one of its most prized faculty members and offered him a number of perks, including discretionary spending accounts financed by NIH funds, a high level of personal control over CHEST’s federal grant funds, and special accommodations in the approval process for obtaining reimbursements from federal funds for his expenses.  PARSONS then abused his authority and influence by repeatedly drawing from these discretionary accounts to fund personal expenses. From January 1, 2010, through May 17, 2018 (the “Covered Period”), PARSONS and HUNTER defrauded the United States by materially misusing federal funds obtained from NIH and making false certifications and statements to NIH and HHS.  First, PARSONS defrauded the Government by improperly using NIH funds that HUNTER had certified to HHS would only be used to support the facilities and administrative costs associated with HUNTER’s NIH grants (the “Indirect Cost Funds”) to reimburse himself for his personal travel expenses, including expenses relating to personal scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, and a tropical birthday celebration.  PARSONS falsely represented that these reimbursement requests all had an academic or research purpose.  PARSONS also improperly used Indirect Cost Funds to double the reimbursement he received for travel relating to his non-NIH-related work as a private consultant to external clients. From December 2010 through December 2013, HUNTER improperly used the Indirect Cost Funds to pay PARSONS over $90,000 in undisclosed retention bonuses, even though NIH rules and regulations prohibited the Indirect Cost Funds from being used to make such payments.  HUNTER never disclosed and, indeed, took steps to hide its use of the Indirect Cost Funds to pay these bonuses to PARSONS. During the Covered Period, PARSONS also misused CHEST’s NIH grant funds to pay CHEST staff for time they spent working for CHEST’s private consulting clients, rather than on NIH grant-related projects.  In order to obtain NIH funds for this purpose, PARSONS approved timekeeping records representing that those staff spent their time and effort working on NIH-funded research projects.  In reality, however, CHEST staff had also spent time working on unrelated projects commissioned by third parties, which were not properly reimbursable from the NIH grant funds and were not accurately reflected on the documents PARSONS submitted to obtain reimbursement.  Although HUNTER was on notice that CHEST staff performed work on outside projects, it nevertheless sought and received NIH funds to improperly pay CHEST staff for this outside work.  The third parties that commissioned CHEST to work on the outside projects separately paid for the work performed by CHEST staff.  HUNTER directed those payments into discretionary accounts to benefit CHEST and PARSONS, including one account used to reimburse PARSONS for alcohol expenses.  Moreover, even after HUNTER became aware that NIH-funded CHEST staff had been improperly utilized to perform work for PARSONS’s private consulting company, HUNTER never took steps to investigate or report to NIH this misuse of NIH funding. As part of the settlement, PARSONS admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: From 2013 through 2017, PARSONS requested reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for scuba diving trips to the Cayman Islands, Bonaire, Cuba, Costa Rica, Fiji, Cozumel, and Belize (the “Scuba Trips”).  As part of his request for reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds, PARSONS represented that the Scuba Trips had a research purpose.  However, PARSONS did not create any documents, data, or records reflecting research he conducted while he was on the Scuba Trips. In addition to the Scuba Trips, from 2016 through 2017, PARSONS also requested reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for travel to Cape Town (the “Cape Town Trip”) and Puerto Rico (the “Puerto Rico Trip,” and together with the Cape Town Trip, the “Personal Trips”).  As part of his request for reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for the Personal Trips, PARSONS represented that the Personal Trips had an academic purpose. From 2016 through 2018, PARSONS sought and received reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds to reimburse himself for travel to Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles.  However, during these trips, PARSONS was not working on projects relating to CHEST’s NIH grants and, instead, was working as a consultant for other institutions.  PARSONS did not reimburse HUNTER or NIH for any of the Indirect Cost Funds he received relating to his travel to Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles as a consultant for other academic institutions. Throughout the Covered Period, PARSONS caused HUNTER to request NIH grant funds to pay the salaries of CHEST staff ostensibly working on CHEST’s NIH-funded research.  PARSONS approved a spreadsheet that purported to reflect the percentage of time and effort that CHEST staff spent working on CHEST’s NIH-funded research (the “Staff Allocation Spreadsheet”).  During the Covered Period, CHEST staff not only worked on projects connected to HUNTER’s own NIH-funded research, but also on unrelated projects commissioned by third parties (“Outside Projects”).  During the Covered Period, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet failed to accurately reflect the time and effort CHEST staff spent working on the Outside Projects.  Instead, during the Covered Period, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet reflected CHEST staff as working entirely on CHEST’s NIH-funded research. As part of the settlement, HUNTER admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: During the Covered Period, HUNTER was aware that CHEST staff worked on Outside Projects and received payments from third parties for that work.  However, the staff’s work on many of the Outside Projects was not reflected on the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet at all, and when it was, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet understated the time that CHEST staff spent working on those Outside Projects.  Instead, the time and effort of CHEST’s staff on the Outside Projects was incorrectly allocated on the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet to projects that NIH funded directly through NIH grants.  HUNTER, in reliance on these incorrect Staff Allocation Spreadsheets, sought and received reimbursement from the NIH for staff time and effort expended on the Outside Projects. HUNTER deposited the funds it received as payment for CHEST’s staff work on the Outside Projects into accounts to benefit CHEST and PARSONS, and one of these accounts was used to reimburse PARSONS for expenses for alcohol at CHEST-related events. From December 2010 through December 2013, HUNTER used Indirect Cost Funds to pay PARSONS over $90,000 of retention bonuses, which were never disclosed to NIH.  Throughout the Covered Period, NIH rules and regulations prohibited the use of Indirect Cost Funds to pay faculty retention bonuses not previously disclosed to NIH. In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a whistleblower lawsuit that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. *                *                * Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General for HHS.

From January 1, 2010, through May 17, 2018 (the “Covered Period”), PARSONS and HUNTER defrauded the United States by materially misusing federal funds obtained from NIH and making false certifications and statements to NIH and HHS.  First, PARSONS defrauded the Government by improperly using NIH funds that HUNTER had certified to HHS would only be used to support the facilities and administrative costs associated with HUNTER’s NIH grants (the “Indirect Cost Funds”) to reimburse himself for his personal travel expenses, including expenses relating to personal scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, and a tropical birthday celebration.  PARSONS falsely represented that these reimbursement requests all had an academic or research purpose.  PARSONS also improperly used Indirect Cost Funds to double the reimbursement he received for travel relating to his non-NIH-related work as a private consultant to external clients. From December 2010 through December 2013, HUNTER improperly used the Indirect Cost Funds to pay PARSONS over $90,000 in undisclosed retention bonuses, even though NIH rules and regulations prohibited the Indirect Cost Funds from being used to make such payments.  HUNTER never disclosed and, indeed, took steps to hide its use of the Indirect Cost Funds to pay these bonuses to PARSONS. During the Covered Period, PARSONS also misused CHEST’s NIH grant funds to pay CHEST staff for time they spent working for CHEST’s private consulting clients, rather than on NIH grant-related projects.  In order to obtain NIH funds for this purpose, PARSONS approved timekeeping records representing that those staff spent their time and effort working on NIH-funded research projects.  In reality, however, CHEST staff had also spent time working on unrelated projects commissioned by third parties, which were not properly reimbursable from the NIH grant funds and were not accurately reflected on the documents PARSONS submitted to obtain reimbursement.  Although HUNTER was on notice that CHEST staff performed work on outside projects, it nevertheless sought and received NIH funds to improperly pay CHEST staff for this outside work.  The third parties that commissioned CHEST to work on the outside projects separately paid for the work performed by CHEST staff.  HUNTER directed those payments into discretionary accounts to benefit CHEST and PARSONS, including one account used to reimburse PARSONS for alcohol expenses.  Moreover, even after HUNTER became aware that NIH-funded CHEST staff had been improperly utilized to perform work for PARSONS’s private consulting company, HUNTER never took steps to investigate or report to NIH this misuse of NIH funding. As part of the settlement, PARSONS admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: From 2013 through 2017, PARSONS requested reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for scuba diving trips to the Cayman Islands, Bonaire, Cuba, Costa Rica, Fiji, Cozumel, and Belize (the “Scuba Trips”).  As part of his request for reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds, PARSONS represented that the Scuba Trips had a research purpose.  However, PARSONS did not create any documents, data, or records reflecting research he conducted while he was on the Scuba Trips. In addition to the Scuba Trips, from 2016 through 2017, PARSONS also requested reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for travel to Cape Town (the “Cape Town Trip”) and Puerto Rico (the “Puerto Rico Trip,” and together with the Cape Town Trip, the “Personal Trips”).  As part of his request for reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds for the Personal Trips, PARSONS represented that the Personal Trips had an academic purpose. From 2016 through 2018, PARSONS sought and received reimbursement from Indirect Cost Funds to reimburse himself for travel to Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles.  However, during these trips, PARSONS was not working on projects relating to CHEST’s NIH grants and, instead, was working as a consultant for other institutions.  PARSONS did not reimburse HUNTER or NIH for any of the Indirect Cost Funds he received relating to his travel to Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles as a consultant for other academic institutions. Throughout the Covered Period, PARSONS caused HUNTER to request NIH grant funds to pay the salaries of CHEST staff ostensibly working on CHEST’s NIH-funded research.  PARSONS approved a spreadsheet that purported to reflect the percentage of time and effort that CHEST staff spent working on CHEST’s NIH-funded research (the “Staff Allocation Spreadsheet”).  During the Covered Period, CHEST staff not only worked on projects connected to HUNTER’s own NIH-funded research, but also on unrelated projects commissioned by third parties (“Outside Projects”).  During the Covered Period, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet failed to accurately reflect the time and effort CHEST staff spent working on the Outside Projects.  Instead, during the Covered Period, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet reflected CHEST staff as working entirely on CHEST’s NIH-funded research. As part of the settlement, HUNTER admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: During the Covered Period, HUNTER was aware that CHEST staff worked on Outside Projects and received payments from third parties for that work.  However, the staff’s work on many of the Outside Projects was not reflected on the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet at all, and when it was, the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet understated the time that CHEST staff spent working on those Outside Projects.  Instead, the time and effort of CHEST’s staff on the Outside Projects was incorrectly allocated on the Staff Allocation Spreadsheet to projects that NIH funded directly through NIH grants.  HUNTER, in reliance on these incorrect Staff Allocation Spreadsheets, sought and received reimbursement from the NIH for staff time and effort expended on the Outside Projects. HUNTER deposited the funds it received as payment for CHEST’s staff work on the Outside Projects into accounts to benefit CHEST and PARSONS, and one of these accounts was used to reimburse PARSONS for expenses for alcohol at CHEST-related events. From December 2010 through December 2013, HUNTER used Indirect Cost Funds to pay PARSONS over $90,000 of retention bonuses, which were never disclosed to NIH.  Throughout the Covered Period, NIH rules and regulations prohibited the use of Indirect Cost Funds to pay faculty retention bonuses not previously disclosed to NIH. In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a whistleblower lawsuit that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. *                *                * Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General for HHS.

Rakoff entered an order today permanently barring RAFAEL ALVAREZ (“ALVAREZ”) and ATAX New York LLC (“ATAX NEW YORK”) from, among other things, preparing federal tax returns for others.  In its civil complaint, the United States alleged that ALVAREZ and ATAX NEW YORK had prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their customers in which they falsely reduced their customers’ tax liabilities and generated tax refunds to which those customers were not entitled.  According to the complaint, ATAX NEW YORK filed over 36,000 tax returns on behalf of its customers from 2016 to 2019. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “This Office will take appropriate actions to shut down tax preparation businesses that prepare and file fraudulent returns and unfairly shift the tax burden to honest American taxpayers.” After the Government filed its complaint, ALVAREZ and ATAX NEW YORK consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and admitted, among other things, that: Between 2016 and 2019, they prepared and filed many federal income tax returns for ATAX NEW YORK’s customers that included claims of expenses, losses, or “head of household” status that lacked adequate supporting information or documentation. These unsupported entries caused the customers’ tax liabilities to be substantially understated. They had no adequate basis for including these entries on their customers’ returns. The Government’s complaint also asked the Court to order disgorgement of the net profits that ALVAREZ and ATAX NEW YORK earned for preparing federal tax returns in which they made reckless or fraudulent claims with respect to their customers’ federal income tax liability.  As part of today’s court-ordered resolution, ALVAREZ and ATAX NEW YORK agreed to pay $159,600 to the United States in disgorgement. Ms. Strauss thanked the Internal Revenue Service’s Small Business/Self-Employed Division for its invaluable assistance in this matter. The case is being handled by the Office’s Tax and Bankruptcy Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Charles S. Jacob and Ilan Stein are in charge of the case.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As part of the settlement, the Town of Harrison has admitted that it never took any disciplinary action against a male firefighter who ultimately pled guilty to harassing a female firefighter.  That type of response to illegal workplace harassment is abhorrent and undermines citizens’ faith in their local government.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the Town of Harrison is required to implement comprehensive policy changes.  I want to commend the bravery of Angela Bommarito, who fought back against discrimination and made this Consent Decree possible.  This Office will always stand with victims of violations of our nation’s civil rights laws.” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said: “All employees deserve a workplace free from sexual harassment and must be able to report harassment without fear of retaliation by employers.  The Justice Department will continue to vigorously pursue all cases to ensure that all workers are guaranteed the rights and protections promised by our Nation’s laws.” As part of the Consent Decree, HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT made factual admissions, including the following: In May 2015, the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT had no active female firefighters.  In June 2015, Angela Bommarito joined the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT, together with one other female volunteer firefighter. HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT ultimately became aware that after Bommarito ended a relationship with Henry Mohr, a senior firefighter, Mohr repeatedly called her, followed her (including while driving a Fire Department official vehicle), and repeatedly drove by her house.  In addition, Bommarito complained to certain members of the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT leadership about Mohr’s harassment. In January 2016, Bommarito went to the HARRISON Police Department and filed a report against Mohr.  HARRISON’S then-Police Chief met with Mohr and told him that he wanted “to make sure this whole thing dies” and get Mohr “out of this whole situation.”  The Police Chief said to Mohr that Bommarito’s presence at the firehouse was a “temptation,” which was “hard to resist sometimes.” The then-Police Chief also met with Bommarito.  During their meeting, the Police Chief suggested that he could arrest Bommarito for her presentation of what the Police Chief claimed was incomplete and false information to the Police Department regarding her relationship with Mohr.  The Police Chief prepared a resignation letter for Bommarito, which stated that she would resign from the Fire Department.  Bommarito signed the resignation letter. HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT never took any disciplinary action against Mohr.  In May 2016, Mohr was arrested for his harassment of Bommarito.  Later that year, Mohr pled guilty to harassment in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law 240.26.03. Under the Consent Decree approved by the Court, HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT must maintain an anti-discrimination policy that includes prohibitions on discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation, as well as provisions that require objective fact-finding investigations into complaints of policy violations.  HARRISON and its FIRE DEPARTMENT must also provide training to relevant personnel on prohibited employment practices and corresponding investigation procedures.  The Consent Decree further requires HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT to provide information to the United States regarding complaints and investigations relating to charges of discrimination while the Consent Decree remains in effect.  The Consent Decree also requires that HARRISON maintain recent improvements to the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT firehouse, which have provided additional facilities and features for female firefighters.  Finally, the Consent Decree requires the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT and HARRISON Police Department to maintain policies relating to use of HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT vehicles and limitations on the disclosure of non-public sensitive information obtained by HARRISON Police Department employees in connection with criminal investigations. As part of the resolution, the Defendants have also agreed to pay a total of $425,000, which will consist of an up-front cash payment to Bommarito and a sum to fund the purchase of an annuity contract to make future periodic payments to Bommarito as well as payments to her attorney for reasonable attorneys’ fees.  This is one of the largest payments by a local government in an employment discrimination case brought by the United States on behalf of a single individual. *                *                * Mr. Williams thanked the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) for its initial investigation of Bommarito’s charge filed with the EEOC.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As part of the settlement, the Town of Harrison has admitted that it never took any disciplinary action against a male firefighter who ultimately pled guilty to harassing a female firefighter.  That type of response to illegal workplace harassment is abhorrent and undermines citizens’ faith in their local government.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the Town of Harrison is required to implement comprehensive policy changes.  I want to commend the bravery of Angela Bommarito, who fought back against discrimination and made this Consent Decree possible.  This Office will always stand with victims of violations of our nation’s civil rights laws.” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said: “All employees deserve a workplace free from sexual harassment and must be able to report harassment without fear of retaliation by employers.  The Justice Department will continue to vigorously pursue all cases to ensure that all workers are guaranteed the rights and protections promised by our Nation’s laws.” As part of the Consent Decree, HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT made factual admissions, including the following: In May 2015, the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT had no active female firefighters.  In June 2015, Angela Bommarito joined the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT, together with one other female volunteer firefighter. HARRISON and the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT ultimately became aware that after Bommarito ended a relationship with Henry Mohr, a senior firefighter, Mohr repeatedly called her, followed her (including while driving a Fire Department official vehicle), and repeatedly drove by her house.  In addition, Bommarito complained to certain members of the HARRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT leadership about Mohr’s harassment. In January 2016, Bommarito went to the HARRISON Police Department and filed a report against Mohr.  HARRISON’S then-Police Chief met with Mohr and told him that he wanted “to make sure this whole thing dies” and get Mohr “out of this whole situation.”  The Police Chief said to Mohr that Bommarito’s presence at the firehouse was a “temptation,” which was “hard to resist sometimes.” The then-Police Chief also met with Bommarito.  During their meeting, the Police Chief suggested that he could arrest Bommarito for her presentation of what the Police Chief claimed was incomplete and false information to the Police Department regarding her relationship with Mohr.  The Police Chief prepared a resignation letter for Bommarito, which stated that she would resign from the Fire Department.  Bommarito signed the resignation letter.

Fitzhugh, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Office of Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), and Marty Raybon, Acting Director, Field Operations, New York, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), announced today that the United States has settled civil fraud claims brought under the False Claims Act against STARGATE APPAREL, INC. (now named EXCEL APPAREL CORP.) (“STARGATE”), RIVSTAR APPAREL, INC. (“RIVSTAR”), and JOSEPH BAILEY.  Stargate and Rivstar are apparel companies headquartered in New York, New York, and BAILEY is the companies’ former CEO and owner.   As alleged in the Government’s lawsuit, filed in 2019, BAILEY, STARGATE, and RIVSTAR employed a variety of schemes to defraud the United States by submitting invoices to CBP that falsely understated the true value of the clothing that they imported into the United States in order to avoid paying millions of dollars in customs duties.  RIVSTAR is no longer operating. Under the civil settlement approved today by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken, BAILEY will pay $3.2 million to the United States, and STARGATE, RIVSTAR, and the employee stock ownership plan that currently owns the companies will together pay a total of $2.8 million to the United States.  BAILEY, STARGATE, and RIVSTAR admitted and accepted responsibility for their conduct as further described below.  As part of the settlement, STARGATE and RIVSTAR (to the extent that it resumes operations) will also implement a written compliance policy that will include measures designed to ensure that they pay duties on the full, actual value of all future imports and otherwise comply with applicable customs laws and regulations.  Last year, BAILEY pled guilty and was sentenced to six months in prison for engaging in certain of the conduct related to STARGATE imports that is at issue in the Government’s civil complaint.  This civil settlement is in addition to the $1,661,617 forfeiture amount that BAILEY was ordered to pay in the criminal proceedings. U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “Stargate, Rivstar, and their former president engaged in a variety of fraudulent schemes to short-change the Government of customs duties owed for imported clothing by falsely under-reporting its value.  This settlement, along with the separate criminal action against Bailey, demonstrate that our Office will hold companies, as well as their executives, accountable when they try to evade paying the legally required custom duties on imported goods.” HSI Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh said: “For over a decade these clothing companies used ‘double-invoice’ schemes to underpay customs duties that were owed to the U.S. for garments being imported into the country, resulting in millions of dollars in customs duties lost.  HSI worked closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York to achieve this settlement, requiring the defendants not just to accept responsibility, but also to pay the Government $6 million and enhance their compliance policies.” CBP Acting Director of New York Field Operations Marty Raybon said: “The settlement reached today is a testament to the dedication of our partners in the United States Attorney's Office, Homeland Security Investigations, and the men and women of CBP in enforcing our nation’s trade laws and punishing those perpetrating this type of fraud.” The Government’s complaint alleges that in order to avoid customs duties, from 2004 through 2015 (the “Covered Period”), STARGATE, RIVSTAR, and BAILEY engaged in two types of “double invoicing” schemes to fraudulently underpay customs duties owed to the United States in connection with the garments that they brought into the country.  Under the first scheme, the exporter would provide one invoice that reflected the amount Defendants actually paid the exporter for the goods, and a second invoice that fraudulently reflected a fabricated lower amount that was submitted to CBP.  These two invoices were virtually identical ( e.g. , same invoice number, description of goods, quantity of goods), except that they included different prices for the same shipments of goods.  Under the second scheme, the exporter also would provide two invoices, which together reflected the actual price paid for the shipment.  However, Defendants would only submit one of the invoices to CBP.  The other invoice, which purported to be for “samples,” “accessories,” “commissions,” or “testing costs,” reflected an additional payment made by Defendants for the same goods described in the first invoice and was not submitted to CBP.  The purpose of each of these two schemes was the same – to fraudulently under-report the value of the goods in order to pay less duties. As part of the settlement, BAILEY, STARGATE, and RIVSTAR admit, acknowledge, and accept responsibility for the following conduct: STARGATE Conduct : During the Covered Period, Stargate’s primary supplier was Taizhou Jiali Garments Co. Ltd. and its affiliated manufacturers (collectively, “Taizhou”), which are all located in China.  At the direction of BAILEY, STARGATE engaged in two different fraudulent schemes that involved the preparation and use of false and inaccurate invoices to underreport the actual value of goods imported from Taizhou in order to avoid paying the customs duties due.  BAILEY knew that this conduct was wrong and in violation of customs laws. As part of the first scheme, from 2007 through 2010, at BAILEY’S direction, Taizhou provided STARGATE with two sets of invoices for each shipment of goods.  One invoice, referred to in email communications as the “pay by” invoice, reflected the actual price paid by STARGATE for the goods.  The second invoice reflected a fake, lower price for the goods and was the invoice that STARGATE presented to CBP through its customs broker.  Stargate, at the direction of Bailey, routinely declared this false, lower value on CBP entry forms in order to pay lower customs duties on goods imported from Taizhou. Beginning around 2010 and continuing through at least 2015, BAILEY and STARGATE engaged in a second scheme.  At BAILEY’S direction, Taizhou provided two separate sets of invoices for a given shipment that together reflected the true price Stargate actually paid for the goods.  The first invoice, typically entitled the “commercial invoice,” described the goods purchased, and was submitted to CBP by STARGATE’s customs broker.  The second invoice purported to reflect amounts paid by Stargate for “sample” goods and was not submitted to CBP.  The “sample” invoice was not, in fact, for samples actually purchased by STARGATE.  Rather, STARGATE used the “sample” invoice to make an additional payment to Taizhou for the goods purchased by STARGATE that were described in the “commercial invoice,” while hiding the full value of those goods from CBP.  STARGATE, at the direction of BAILEY, routinely declared only the values recorded on the “commercial invoices,” which were less than the full price paid for the goods, on CBP entry forms in order to pay lower customs duties on goods imported from Taizhou. During the Covered Period, STARGATE also imported goods that it purchased from Tex-Prime International, Ltd., and its affiliated manufacturers (collectively “Tex-Prime”), which are located in China.  Beginning in at least 2004 and continuing through 2014, STARGATE, at the direction of BAILEY, also engaged in two different fraudulent schemes that involved the preparation and use of false and inaccurate invoices to underreport the actual value of goods imported from Tex-Prime in order to avoid paying the customs duties due. The first scheme involved Tex-Prime providing two nearly identical invoices for each shipment that differed only in the stated price.  The first invoice reflected the amount that STARGATE actually paid for the imported goods.  The second invoice (frequently identified by a “C” suffix following the invoice number, or the term “Custom” following the invoice number in the file name), reflected a false and inaccurate lower price and was the invoice that STARGATE submitted to CBP through STARGATE’s customs broker.  STARGATE, at the direction of BAILEY, routinely declared the values recorded on this second, false invoice on CBP entry forms in order to pay lower customs duties on goods imported from Tex-Prime. The second scheme also involved Tex-Prime providing two invoices.  In this scheme, the two invoices together reflected the actual price paid by STARGATE for the shipment.  The first invoice, entitled a “commercial invoice,” described the goods purchased and was submitted to CBP by STARGATE’s customs broker.  The second invoice, entitled a “statement,” purported to be an invoice for accessories charges, commissions, testing charges, or samples.  This second invoice was not submitted to CBP and in reality reflected an additional payment made by STARGATE to Tex-Prime for the same shipment.  STARGATE, at the direction of BAILEY, routinely declared only the values recorded on the “commercial invoices,” which were less than the full price paid for the goods, on CBP entry forms in order to pay lower customs duties on goods imported from Tex-Prime. Through the practices described above, STARGATE misrepresented the value of the goods it purchased and imported into the United States.  STARGATE and BAILEY were aware at all times that the reported information was incorrect and grossly understated the actual value of the imported goods, but continued to make the incorrect entries in order to reduce the amount of duties owed.  As a result of their conduct, STARGATE and BAILEY underpaid customs duties that were due and owing to the United States. RIVSTAR Conduct : During the Covered Period, RIVSTAR imported goods purchased from Pacific Potential Trading Co., Ltd., and its affiliated entities (together, “Pacific Potential”), as well as from Dongguan Bestsign and Trading Co., Ltd., and its affiliated entities (together, “Bestsign”), all of which are located in China. During the Covered Period, at RIVSTAR’s request and BAILEY’s direction, Pacific Potential and Bestsign provided two sets of invoices for each shipment imported into the United States by RIVSTAR.  The first invoice described the goods imported and was submitted to CBP by RIVSTAR’s customs broker.  The price reflected on the invoices declared to Customs did not reflect the full price RIVSTAR paid for the merchandise.  The second invoice purported to be for “testing costs” relating to the imported goods and was not submitted to CBP.  Together, the two invoices reflected the true total price that RIVSTAR paid for the goods; RIVSTAR, however, did not declare the amount reflected on the invoice for “testing costs” to CBP.  For the most part, the amounts reflected on the invoice for “testing costs” were not for actual testing, but instead reflected an additional payment made by RIVSTAR to Pacific Potential and Bestsign for the same shipment that was not declared to CBP.  To the extent that any such payments actually related to testing costs, such charges were still dutiable and should have been declared to CBP. Through these practices, RIVSTAR at BAILEY’s direction misrepresented the value of the goods it purchased and imported into the United States.  RIVSTAR and BAILEY were aware at all times that the reported information was incorrect and grossly understated the actual value of the imported goods, but continued to make the incorrect entries in order to reduce the amount of duties owed. As a result of their conduct, RIVSTAR and BAILEY underpaid customs duties that were due and owing to the United States. The conduct in this matter was first brought to the attention of federal law enforcement by a whistleblower who filed a lawsuit under the False Claims Act. Ms. Strauss thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations for their assistance with the case. The civil case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Dominika Tarczynska is in charge of the matter.

Through the practices described above, STARGATE misrepresented the value of the goods it purchased and imported into the United States.  STARGATE and BAILEY were aware at all times that the reported information was incorrect and grossly understated the actual value of the imported goods, but continued to make the incorrect entries in order to reduce the amount of duties owed.  As a result of their conduct, STARGATE and BAILEY underpaid customs duties that were due and owing to the United States. RIVSTAR Conduct : During the Covered Period, RIVSTAR imported goods purchased from Pacific Potential Trading Co., Ltd., and its affiliated entities (together, “Pacific Potential”), as well as from Dongguan Bestsign and Trading Co., Ltd., and its affiliated entities (together, “Bestsign”), all of which are located in China. During the Covered Period, at RIVSTAR’s request and BAILEY’s direction, Pacific Potential and Bestsign provided two sets of invoices for each shipment imported into the United States by RIVSTAR.  The first invoice described the goods imported and was submitted to CBP by RIVSTAR’s customs broker.  The price reflected on the invoices declared to Customs did not reflect the full price RIVSTAR paid for the merchandise.  The second invoice purported to be for “testing costs” relating to the imported goods and was not submitted to CBP.  Together, the two invoices reflected the true total price that RIVSTAR paid for the goods; RIVSTAR, however, did not declare the amount reflected on the invoice for “testing costs” to CBP.  For the most part, the amounts reflected on the invoice for “testing costs” were not for actual testing, but instead reflected an additional payment made by RIVSTAR to Pacific Potential and Bestsign for the same shipment that was not declared to CBP.  To the extent that any such payments actually related to testing costs, such charges were still dutiable and should have been declared to CBP. Through these practices, RIVSTAR at BAILEY’s direction misrepresented the value of the goods it purchased and imported into the United States.  RIVSTAR and BAILEY were aware at all times that the reported information was incorrect and grossly understated the actual value of the imported goods, but continued to make the incorrect entries in order to reduce the amount of duties owed. As a result of their conduct, RIVSTAR and BAILEY underpaid customs duties that were due and owing to the United States. The conduct in this matter was first brought to the attention of federal law enforcement by a whistleblower who filed a lawsuit under the False Claims Act. Ms. Strauss thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations for their assistance with the case. The civil case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Dominika Tarczynska is in charge of the matter.

(“AIG”) involving seven cross-border financial transactions that the United States asserted were abusive tax shelters designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits that AIG improperly attempted to use to reduce its tax liabilities in the United States.  AIG filed this tax refund lawsuit in 2009, seeking to recover disallowed foreign tax credits and other taxes related to the 1997 tax year.  The United States obtained overwhelming evidence that these transactions lacked any meaningful economic substance, were devoid of any legitimate business purpose, and instead were designed solely to manufacture hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits to which AIG was not entitled.  According to the terms of the settlement, approved yesterday by United States District Judge Louis L. Stanton, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that AIG claimed for the 1997 tax year and all later tax years for these same transactions, totaling more than $400 million, would be disallowed in their entirety.  AIG further agreed to pay a 10% tax penalty. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “AIG created an elaborate series of sham transactions that were designed to do nothing – and in fact did nothing – other than generate hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten tax benefits for AIG.  Our system of taxation is built upon the premise that all citizens and corporations must pay the taxes they owe, no more and no less.  People and companies who game that system to avoid paying their fair share of taxes undermine public trust in our tax laws.  We will continue to be vigilant in holding accountable those who use economically empty transactions to avoid paying their taxes.” As alleged in filings in Manhattan federal court: During the mid-1990s, AIG Financial Products Corp. (“AIG-FP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, designed, marketed, and entered into seven cross-border structured finance transactions with various foreign banks.  These complicated transactions, involving hundreds of agreements, numerous shell companies, and intricate cash flows, had no economic substance but rather exploited differences in U.S. and foreign tax laws to create profits from U.S. tax benefits.  In particular, the transactions generated more than $400 million in foreign tax credits that AIG used to reduce its U.S. tax liabilities.  The U.S. has a worldwide tax system that taxes companies on income earned abroad, but also grants credits for foreign taxes paid.  AIG, was able to turn a profit by obtaining credits from the U.S. Treasury for foreign taxes it did not actually pay in full.  AIG obtained more than $61 million in foreign tax credits during the 1997 tax year alone, the tax year resolved by the settlement. In 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Notice of Deficiency to AIG that, among other things, disallowed the foreign tax credits AIG had claimed in connection with the seven transactions and asserted a 20% tax penalty.  In 2009, after paying the deficiency, AIG filed a lawsuit against the United States in Manhattan federal court challenging the IRS’s determination and demanding a refund.  In response, the United States asserted that the IRS had correctly disallowed the tax benefits because the transactions had no economic substance, a basic requirement for seeking tax benefits. According to the terms of the Settlement, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that AIG claimed in connection with the seven cross-border transactions that were the subject of the litigation would be disallowed in full for the 1997 tax year and all subsequent tax years during which the transactions were operating, totaling more than $400 million.  AIG further agreed to pay a 10% penalty.  The settlement allows AIG to retain certain income expense deductions relating to six of the transactions that were structured as borrowings, as well as remove certain amounts related to the transactions from its taxable income.  In addition, the settlement resolves certain of AIG’s tax refund claims unrelated to the cross-border transactions stemming from AIG‘s restatement of its publicly filed financials. The Acting U.S. Attorney thanked the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, as well as the IRS Office of Chief Counsel, including Jill Frisch, Matthew Avon, Jackie Levinson, Barbara Felker, and Michael Gilman, for all of their assistance throughout the litigation. The case is being handled by the Office’s Tax and Bankruptcy Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pierre Armand, Talia Kraemer, Jennifer Jude, and Charles Jacob, and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicolas Boeving, Arastu Chaudhry, John Clopper, Joseph Cordaro, Caleb Hayes-Deats, and Bertrand Madsen, handled the case.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mark Tasky, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (“DHS-OIG”), and Margaret Garnett, Commissioner, New York City Department of Investigation (“DOI”), announced today that the United States filed a civil fraud lawsuit today against the CITY OF NEW YORK (the “City”) alleging that the NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (“NYCDOT”) fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) by falsely claiming that numerous NYCDOT vehicles were damaged during Superstorm Sandy (“Sandy”).  The United States also submitted a proposed settlement of the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for review and approval.  Under the proposed settlement, the City agreed to pay and revert to the United States a total of $5,303,624 and admitted to conduct alleged in the Government’s complaint, including seeking reimbursement from FEMA for vehicles that were not damaged by Sandy. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “FEMA serves a critical role in providing emergency relief to those who are tragically struck by disaster.  When people lie to FEMA about the cause of property damage in order to reap a windfall, it compromises FEMA’s ability to provide financial assistance to legitimate disaster victims in desperate need.  This Office will take decisive enforcement action to protect FEMA and its vital programs from fraud, waste, and abuse.” DHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Mark Tasky said:  “Taking advantage of Federal funds intended for disaster relief misappropriates taxpayer dollars, reduces funds available to true victims, and erodes public confidence in relief efforts. Through DHS OIG’s criminal and civil investigative oversight function of DHS programs, and working closely with our partners in the New York City’s Department of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, we ensured that over $5.3 million in disaster relief funds were repaid to the United States, and ultimately the U.S. taxpayer. With so many New York residents impacted by Superstorm Sandy, it is critical to ensure every dollar of appropriated relief funds are properly used and accounted for.” DOI Commissioner Margaret Garnett said:  “Today’s settlement is the successful outcome of a joint investigation with our federal partners, which uncovered falsified submissions by the City to the federal government that allowed the City to wrongly obtain millions of dollars in federal emergency funds.  Our investigation found that a lack of vigilant management and inadequate training of City personnel at the City Department of Transportation led to this wrongdoing in connection with a federal public assistance program.  As New York City’s independent watchdog, DOI is grateful for our effective partnership with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the New York Regional Office of the United States Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General on this investigation.” According to the Government’s Complaint, the City participated in FEMA’s Public Assistance program, which allows municipalities to obtain indemnification funds from FEMA to repair or replace property damaged by natural disasters, such as Sandy.  As part of the program, the City was required to certify that the property damage was incurred as a direct result of the disaster.  The City was also required to provide training to employees on program rules and requirements, including the importance of ensuring that costs for which indemnification is sought are directly attributable to a disaster. Following Sandy, the NYCDOT created a list of vehicles within the agency’s fleet that had been damaged by the storm and submitted it to FEMA for indemnification pursuant to the Public Assistance program.  The NYCDOT personnel responsible for generating the list of damaged vehicles, to whom the City provided no training on the Public Assistance program, made no effort to inspect the vehicles or otherwise determine whether any reported damage was attributable to Sandy.  In fact, a number of the vehicles included on this list were inoperable long before Sandy. In 2014, based on this faulty list, the City submitted a request for indemnification to FEMA seeking to recover the full cost of replacing 132 NYCDOT vehicles.  The City submitted a certification to FEMA as part of the program and a request for indemnification that falsely attested that all costs were incurred as a direct result of Sandy.  Many of the vehicles for which the City sought full replacement costs had been nonoperational or not in use prior to the storm.  As a result of these false certifications, FEMA paid the City millions of dollars to which it was not entitled. As part of the proposed settlement, the City will pay the United States a total of $5,303,624.  Specifically, the City will make a cash payment of $4,126,227.34 and relinquish rights to an additional $1,177,396.66 that FEMA had previously approved for disbursement.  During this Office’s investigation, the City withdrew another $3,196,376 in indemnity requests, acknowledging that the costs were ineligible for reimbursement. In connection with the proposed settlement, the City also admitted conduct alleged in the Complaint, including: The Deputy Commissioner from NYCDOT who signed the certification lacked personal knowledge about the vehicles sufficient to make a certification about how and when they were damaged and did not personally undertake or direct others to undertake any investigation of the vehicles prior to signing the certification. The list of vehicles for which the City was seeking reimbursement included a number of vehicles that were not damaged as a direct result of Sandy to a state beyond repair.  A number of the vehicles that the City included had not been operational prior to Sandy. Prior to making the submission and certification to FEMA, neither the City nor NYCDOT undertook a sufficient review to ascertain whether all of the vehicles listed had been operational and in use prior to Sandy; or whether the amounts presented to FEMA for reimbursement accurately represented the losses the City incurred from Sandy. In June 2014, a NYCDOT employee notified the Deputy Commissioner that certain of the vehicles for which the City had sought reimbursement from FEMA were not eligible. Yet, it was not until after it became aware of this Office’s investigation that the City took steps to notify FEMA. The proposed settlement must be approved by the District Court. Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of DHS-OIG and DOI.  This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Jean Hu is in charge of the case.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), Helen M. Albert, Principal Deputy Inspector General, performing the duties of the Inspector General, HUD Office of the Inspector General (“HUD OIG”), and Scott Pruitt, Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today the simultaneous filing of a Complaint against defendant NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY (“NYCHA”) and a proposed settlement agreement, in the form of a Consent Decree, with NYCHA and the City of New York (the “City”).  The Complaint alleges that NYCHA for years has violated and continues to violate basic federal health and safety regulations, including regulations requiring NYCHA to protect children from lead paint and otherwise to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing.  The Complaint further alleges that NYCHA has repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the public regarding its lead paint compliance, and has intentionally deceived HUD inspectors.  To fundamentally reform NYCHA and ensure that it provides housing that complies with federal law, the Consent Decree – which is subject to the review and approval of the Court – imposes a strong federal Monitor and requires the City, among other things, to provide $1.2 billion of additional capital funding to NYCHA over the next five years, and $200 million every year thereafter until the problems are fixed and the Consent Decree is no longer necessary. Along with other federal, state, and city funding, there will be approximately $ 4 billion available for capital improvements the first four years. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated:  “NYCHA’s failure to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing is simply unacceptable, and illegal.  Children must be protected from toxic lead paint, apartments must be free of mold and pest infestations, and developments must provide adequate heat in winter and elevator service.  NYCHA has put its residents at risk.  Today’s unprecedented settlement will improve life for the 400,000 residents who call NYCHA home, while ensuring accountability, reform, and oversight at this troubled institution. The City’s commitment of resources to NYCHA is extraordinary and promises real relief for NYCHA residents.” HUD Secretary Ben Carson said:  “This historic agreement marks a new era for New York City’s public housing, one that puts families and their children first.  New York City and New York State are making an unprecedented commitment to put NYCHA on a new path.  The cooperation of Federal, State and city officials will vastly improve the living conditions for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who call NYCHA home.” HUD OIG Principal Deputy Inspector General Helen M. Albert said:  “We are proud of the integral work that the OIG staff performed which led to today’s settlement.  This represents a consequential partnership with the U.S. Attorney and others to ensure that those who reside in NYCHA housing will do so in safe and sanitary conditions.” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said:  “Instead of protecting children from lead poisoning, NYCHA systematically violated EPA and HUD lead paint safety regulations and covered up its noncompliance.  Today’s landmark settlement puts a stop to that.  It is not only a great example of what EPA and HUD can achieve by working together, but it also sends a strong message to housing authorities, landlords, and renovators – violating the law and endangering public health will not be tolerated.  This agreement will dramatically improve the living conditions of New York City’s most vulnerable residents.” According to the Complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court: For years, NYCHA has failed to comply with key HUD and EPA lead paint safety regulations, including by failing to inspect apartments for lead paint hazards and failing to remediate peeling lead paint.  NYCHA also fails to ensure that its workers use lead-safe work practices.  Children have been harmed as a result of NYCHA’s failures.  Between 2010 and 2016, at least 19 lead-poisoned children were found to have been exposed to deteriorated lead paint in their NYCHA apartments, and thousands more were put at risk. NYCHA also fails to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing as required by HUD regulations.  Mold grows unchecked at many NYCHA developments, often on a very large scale, threatening the health of residents with asthma.  Across the city, NYCHA residents are provided inadequate heat in winter, leading to frigid apartment temperatures.  Pest and vermin infestations are common.  Elevators fail, leaving elderly or disabled residents trapped in their apartments or sleeping in building lobbies. NYCHA has repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the public regarding these matters.  These include false certifications by NYCHA each year that it would comply with HUD’s lead paint safety regulations.  NYCHA also deceived HUD about living conditions at NYCHA, going so far as to publish a “Quick Tips” training guide for how to hide conditions from HUD’s inspectors. *                *                * The United States has filed a proposed Consent Decree today, which would resolve the allegations in the Complaint.  The Consent Decree remains subject to review and approval by the Court.  The Consent Decree provides for the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee fundamental reform at NYCHA.  The Monitor has the authority, under the review of the Court, to set the performance standards that NYCHA must meet, devise the plans by which NYCHA will achieve those standards (including by implementing changes to NYCHA’s management, organization, and workforce structure), and require NYCHA to select independent contractors to perform certain work.  The Monitor will be selected by the United States, after consultation with City and state officials and NYCHA stakeholders, and subject to approval by the Court. The Consent Decree also commits the City of New York to provide an additional $1 billion in capital funds over the next four years, over and above what the City has budgeted, and at least an additional $200 million in capital funds each subsequent year until the conditions identified in the Complaint are addressed.  Further, the Consent Decree requires NYCHA to comply immediately with HUD’s and EPA’s lead-safe work practices rules and to provide notice to residents in any apartment where NYCHA has identified lead paint. *                *                * In the Consent Decree submitted today, NYCHA admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following: At least once a year, beginning no later than 2010 and extending through 2016, NYCHA’s certifications to HUD contained untrue representations that NYCHA “will comply with” HUD’s federal lead paint safety regulations. In more than half of NYCHA’s developments, NYCHA’s inspections (including statistical sampling) have confirmed the presence of lead paint somewhere on the premises, and in at least 92 developments, the inspections (including statistical sampling) have confirmed the presence of lead paint inside apartment units. Since at least 2010, NYCHA has not performed most of the biennial lead paint risk assessment reevaluations required by regulation for developments containing lead paint. From at least 2012 to 2016, NYCHA failed to perform visual assessments of apartments for lead paint hazards as required by regulation.  In 2016, NYCHA began performing visual assessments in units where children under six reside, but NYCHA has not yet performed visual assessments in the majority of apartments that may contain lead paint. Since at least 2010, NYCHA has not ensured that staff use lead-safe work practices when performing work on surfaces that may contain lead paint. Currently, after NYCHA has removed mold from apartments, the mold returns at least 30% of the time. In Winter 2017-2018 alone, more than 320,000 residents, 80% of the public housing population, lost heat. In 2016 alone, NYCHA experienced an average of more than 13 outages per elevator. NYCHA’s data reflects more than 260,000 work orders for roaches between 2013 and 2016.  For the same period, there were more than 90,000 mouse work orders and nearly 36,000 rat work orders. For a decade, NYCHA provided its staff with a list of “Quick Fix Tips” to improve its Public Housing Assessment System inspection scores. Mr. Berman thanked HUD, HUD OIG, and EPA for their invaluable assistance in this matter.  Mr. Berman also thanked Mark Peters and the Department of Investigation for their important wok in this area. This case is being handled by the Office’s Environmental Protection Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant United States Attorneys Robert William Yalen, Mónica P. Folch, Jacob Lillywhite, Talia Kraemer, and Sharanya Mohan are in charge of the case.

JAMES, and the WALTER KERR, involving violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act (the “ADA”).  The settlement, in the form of a consent decree, was entered yesterday by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. U.S. Attorney Strauss said: “As New York City begins to reopen and welcome the world once again, we are pleased that Jujamcyn Theaters has worked collaboratively with the Office to improve accessibility at its historic venues, so that all patrons are able to enjoy Broadway.  As a result of this suit and settlement, coupled with similar lawsuits filed by the Office against the Shubert Theaters in 2003, and the Nederlander Theaters in 2014, all three of the major Broadway theater organizations have committed to making their venues significantly more accessible to people with disabilities.” According to the Complaint and Consent Decree filed in Manhattan federal court: In the course of an investigation and negotiation over several years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office identified numerous ADA violations at each of the five theaters operated by JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC, all of which were opened in the 1920s.  The ADA generally requires that, for facilities constructed prior to the effective date of the ADA in 1993, barriers to accessibility be removed where it is readily achievable to do so.  Throughout the Government’s investigation and the negotiation of the Consent Decree, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC agreed to remove hundreds of barriers to accessibility. Under the Consent Decree, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC agrees to continue its efforts to improve accessibility at its theaters, as the schedules of shows at the theaters permit. Specifically, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC has agreed to do the following: provide a total of 44 wheelchair accessible seating locations, and direct its ticket vendors to accord priority to persons with disabilities in selling those seating locations; provide a total of 54 aisle transfer seating locations for persons who are able to transfer from a wheelchair into a seat, and direct its ticket vendors to accord priority to persons with disabilities in selling those seating locations; and eliminate approximately 200 individual barriers to accessibility in theater restrooms, concession counters, waiting areas, and box offices. In addition, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC will pay a $40,000 civil penalty to the United States. Since President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has played a significant role in bringing numerous New York City institutions into compliance with the ADA and its regulations.  The Office’s enforcement efforts include, among many others, Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Shubert Theaters, the Nederlander Theaters, Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera, the Apollo Theater, the Puck Building, the Rainbow Room, and The Vessel at Hudson Yards. To file a complaint alleging that any place of public accommodation within the Southern District of New York is not accessible to persons with disabilities, use the Civil Rights Complaint Form available on the United States Attorney’s Office’s website, www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys .

Jujamcyn Theaters LLC consent decree and exhibits [PDF, ] Topic Civil Rights Component USAO - New York, Southern Press Release Number: 21-174 U.S. Attorney Files And Simultaneously Settles Lawsuit Against Jujamcyn Theaters LLC To Improve Accessibility At Five Of Broadway’s Most Historic Theaters U.S. Attorney Files And Simultaneously Settles Lawsuit Against Jujamcyn Theaters LLC To Improve Accessibility At Five Of Broadway’s Most Historic Theaters Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email Audrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today the filing and settlement of a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court against JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC, the owners and operators of five of Broadway’s most historic theaters, the AL HIRSCHFELD, the AUGUST WILSON, the EUGENE O’NEILL, the ST. JAMES, and the WALTER KERR, involving violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act (the “ADA”).  The settlement, in the form of a consent decree, was entered yesterday by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. U.S. Attorney Strauss said: “As New York City begins to reopen and welcome the world once again, we are pleased that Jujamcyn Theaters has worked collaboratively with the Office to improve accessibility at its historic venues, so that all patrons are able to enjoy Broadway.  As a result of this suit and settlement, coupled with similar lawsuits filed by the Office against the Shubert Theaters in 2003, and the Nederlander Theaters in 2014, all three of the major Broadway theater organizations have committed to making their venues significantly more accessible to people with disabilities.” According to the Complaint and Consent Decree filed in Manhattan federal court: In the course of an investigation and negotiation over several years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office identified numerous ADA violations at each of the five theaters operated by JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC, all of which were opened in the 1920s.  The ADA generally requires that, for facilities constructed prior to the effective date of the ADA in 1993, barriers to accessibility be removed where it is readily achievable to do so.  Throughout the Government’s investigation and the negotiation of the Consent Decree, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC agreed to remove hundreds of barriers to accessibility. Under the Consent Decree, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC agrees to continue its efforts to improve accessibility at its theaters, as the schedules of shows at the theaters permit. Specifically, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC has agreed to do the following: provide a total of 44 wheelchair accessible seating locations, and direct its ticket vendors to accord priority to persons with disabilities in selling those seating locations; provide a total of 54 aisle transfer seating locations for persons who are able to transfer from a wheelchair into a seat, and direct its ticket vendors to accord priority to persons with disabilities in selling those seating locations; and eliminate approximately 200 individual barriers to accessibility in theater restrooms, concession counters, waiting areas, and box offices. In addition, JUJAMCYN THEATERS LLC will pay a $40,000 civil penalty to the United States. Since President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has played a significant role in bringing numerous New York City institutions into compliance with the ADA and its regulations.  The Office’s enforcement efforts include, among many others, Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Shubert Theaters, the Nederlander Theaters, Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera, the Apollo Theater, the Puck Building, the Rainbow Room, and The Vessel at Hudson Yards. To file a complaint alleging that any place of public accommodation within the Southern District of New York is not accessible to persons with disabilities, use the Civil Rights Complaint Form available on the United States Attorney’s Office’s website, www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys .

Garcia, the Regional Administrator for Region 2 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today that the United States and the State of New York have entered into a civil Consent Decree with the CITY OF MOUNT VERNON, New York, to resolve ongoing litigation regarding MOUNT VERNON’s non-compliance with Clean Water Act requirements for municipal storm sewers, which has caused raw sewage to be discharged into the Bronx and Hutchinson Rivers. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “This important settlement provides a path forward for the City of Mount Vernon to comply with the Clean Water Act, protect water quality, and address the needs of its residents who are living with the unlawful discharge of sewage and illicit pollutants.  My Office remains committed to protecting human health and the environment in overburdened and underserved communities such as Mount Vernon, and beyond.” EPA Regional Administrator Lisa F. Garcia said: “The people of Mount Vernon deserve a safe and functioning sewage system.  By engaging the city and state we have come up with an enforceable agreement that sets a schedule to reduce pollution and protect public health.  This settlement embodies EPA’s commitment to environmental equity and working with communities to tackle the long-standing challenge of aging water infrastructure.” The Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharges of pollutants into navigable waters, unless in compliance with a permit.  Many municipalities, like MOUNT VERNON, operate “municipal separate storm sewer systems” (or “MS4s”) that carry storm water and discharge it without treatment into nearby waters.  Because separate storm sewer systems do not treat the water they discharge, a municipality is required by its MS4 permit to maintain a program for identifying and eliminating any sewage or other illicit pollutants flowing into the storm sewers. According to the allegations in the June 28, 2018, Complaint, the Consent Decree filed today, and other court records: In June 2018, the United States sued MOUNT VERNON, alleging that since at least January 2012, MOUNT VERNON had failed to comply with these permit obligations and, as a result, had allowed raw sewage to flow into its storm sewer system and then to be discharged into the Hutchinson and Bronx Rivers.  The Complaint also alleged that MOUNT VERNON had failed to comply with two EPA Administrative Orders issued to compel MOUNT VERNON’s adherence to these requirements.  New York State joined the United States as co-plaintiff in this lawsuit. In September 2020, the District Court granted the governments’ motion for summary judgment and entered an order requiring MOUNT VERNON to take various steps to come into compliance with Clean Water Act MS4 requirements.  However, after the court order was entered, Mount Vernon repeatedly missed deadlines and reporting obligations, forcing the governments to obtain multiple subsequent court orders compelling compliance and imposing financial sanctions against MOUNT VERNON. Despite this need for enforcement efforts, as reflected in the Consent Decree, MOUNT VERNON has made progress on its compliance obligations.  Much work, however, remains to be done.  New York State has provided or committed to provide significant financial assistance to MOUNT VERNON to fund repairs to the City’s sewers. The Consent Decree, filed with the Court today, provides a path forward for compliance in light of these developments, including by requiring MOUNT VERNON to perform sewer system repairs that MOUNT VERNON estimates will cost in excess of $100 million.  Among other requirements, the Consent Decree provides the following: MOUNT VERNON must construct two pump stations designed to eliminate identified sources of potential infiltration to the MS4. MOUNT VERNON must either eliminate all other sources of illicit discharges within 30 days of identifying them or submit a binding plan for EPA’s and New York State’s approval for addressing specific sources that require a longer period to eliminate. Immediately upon identifying sanitary sewer overflows that could cause illicit discharges into the MS4, MOUNT VERNON must take steps to mitigate those overflows. MOUNT VERNON must complete a Sewer System Evaluation Survey and submit for EPA’s and New York State’s approval a Sewer System Corrective Action Plan (“SSCAP”) “that addresses structural, operational, and maintenance issues for each of the conditions identified in the Sewer System Evaluation Survey.”  The SSCAP will be binding and enforceable under the Consent Decree. MOUNT VERNON must implement its updated Stormwater Management Program Plan for its MS4 and its Capacity, Management, Operation, and Maintenance program for its sanitary sewers. MOUNT VERNON must keep its mapping of sewer system outfalls current. MOUNT VERNON must continue to engage engineering and financial experts to help manage its sewer system compliance. MOUNT VERNON must undertake transparency and environmental justice measures, including by “evaluat[ing] any potential adverse impacts of construction, repairs, and other actions undertaken pursuant to [the Consent Decree] on overburdened and underserved populations” and “mitigat[ing] any such potential adverse impacts of construction, repairs, and other actions . . . to the maximum extent possible consistent with such work.” The Consent Decree also provides for a $200,000 civil penalty to resolve the governments’ claims for civil penalties for the violations alleged in the Complaint.  Of that, $100,000 will be paid to the United States.  $100,000 will be owed to New York State with payment suspended unless MOUNT VERNON fails to comply with the Consent Decree. In the Consent Decree, MOUNT VERNON also admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for certain conduct, including the following: Since at least 2013, MOUNT VERNON has not been in compliance with the permit applicable to its MS4 because it has not fully implemented and enforced an Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program.  Among other things: MOUNT VERNON has not provided funding, equipment, and staffing levels necessary to implement and enforce an Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program. MOUNT VERNON did not complete an outfall reconnaissance inventory for all MS4 outfalls until 2022. MOUNT VERNON submitted annual reports month later than the deadlines in June 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. MOUNT VERNON did not submit accurate information in its 2017 and 2018 Annual Reports regarding its completions of the Outfall Reconnaissance Inventory. Moreover, at least up to and including the time the Complaint was filed, MOUNT VERNON also failed to meet the following permit requirements: MOUNT VERNON did not maintain a map showing all outfall locations, all surface waters receiving outfall discharges, and all storm sewersheds. MOUNT VERNON did not adopt measurable goals for the detection, elimination, and reduction of illicit discharges. MOUNT VERNON did not adequately inform the public about the hazards of illegal discharges. MOUNT VERNON did not select and implement measures to reduce the amount of pollutants of concern in storm water discharges. The Mount Vernon MS4 has discharged and at times continues to discharge untreated sewage into the Bronx and Hutchinson Rivers. MOUNT VERNON did not comply with two administrative orders issued by EPA to compel MOUNT VERNON’s compliance with the General Permit and the Clean Water Act. *                *                * To provide public notice and afford members of the public the opportunity to comment on the Consent Decree, the Consent Decree will be lodged with the District Court for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval. Mr. Williams thanked the attorneys and enforcement staff at EPA Region 2 for their critical work on this matter and also thanked the attorneys and staff at the New York Attorney General’s Office and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. This case is being handled by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert William Yalen is in charge of the case.

Highsmith, Executive Assistant Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (“CBP”) Office of Trade, and Francis Russo, Director of CBP Field Operations New York, announced today that the United States has filed and settled a civil lawsuit against International Vitamins Corporation (“IVC”), a United States-based company that imports and sells vitamins and nutritional supplements from China.  The settlement resolves claims that, for years, IVC defrauded the United States by misclassifying more than 30 of its products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (“HTS”) in order to avoid paying customs duties and by failing to pay back duties owed to the United States even after IVC finally corrected its longstanding misclassifications. Under the settlement agreement approved by U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil, IVC will pay $22,865,055 to the United States.  As part of the settlement agreement, IVC also made admissions regarding its conduct.  IVC admitted that, between 2015 and 2019, it utilized HTS classifications for 32 products it imported from China (the “Covered Products”) that carried duty-free rates, even though those products, if accurately classified, would have been subject to the payment of duties.  IVC also admitted that even after it retained a consultant in 2018 who informed IVC that it had been misclassifying the Covered Products, IVC did not implement the correct classifications for over nine months and never remitted duties that it had underpaid to the United States because of its misclassification of the Covered Products. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “IVC engaged in a fraudulent scheme to avoid customs duties owed to the United States by misclassifying many of its products as duty-free when importing them from China.  Worse yet, IVC made no effort to right its wrongs even after acknowledging internally that it had underpaid millions of dollars of duties owed.  This Office is committed to combatting customs fraud by holding companies accountable when they attempt to avoid paying what they owe when importing goods from abroad.” CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner AnnMarie R. Highsmith said: “This case reflects a pattern of behavior in which this company knowingly misclassified imported merchandise to avoid paying duties.  They did so despite clear prior rulings by CBP on the correct classification for this specific type of product.  Their failure to adhere to the customs laws, which are designed to protect U.S. revenue and U.S. consumers, will cost the company more than $22.8 million under the terms of a civil settlement with the United States.  The dedication of the men and women of the CBP Office of Trade, the Office of Chief Counsel New York, and the United States Attorney’s Office to protect a fair and competitive trade environment is vital to facilitating lawful trade.” CBP Director of Field Operations Francis Russo said: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided the critical link to an ongoing investigation into an attempt to circumvent payment of proper duties.  This case serves as a great example of collaborative law enforcement efforts to uncover and dismantle enterprises that seek to defraud the United States government for personal gain while causing economic harm to their competitors.” As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: From January 1, 2015, through September 13, 2019 (the “Covered Period”), IVC made thousands of entries of the Covered Products (consisting of raw and bulk vitamins and nutritional supplements) into the United States from China while materially misreporting to CBP the duty rates applicable to those products under the HTS.  IVC knowingly submitted or caused its customs brokers to submit entry documents to CBP that contained false classifications of the Covered Products in order to avoid paying duties owed and failed to remit underpaid duties even after IVC confirmed that the classifications it had used were incorrect. IVC utilized inaccurate HTS classifications for the Covered Products despite receiving repeated notices from CBP informing IVC that the classifications it had been using for similar goods were erroneous.  After continuing to use the incorrect HTS classifications for more than three years, IVC retained a consultant to analyze the propriety of its classifications.  Even after the consultant confirmed that IVC had been misclassifying the Covered Products under the HTS, IVC persisted in using its incorrect classifications for these goods for over nine months.  Throughout, IVC provided the incorrect classifications to its customs brokers, knowing that they would rely on those classifications when preparing documents to be submitted to CBP on IVC’s behalf. When IVC finally adopted the correct classifications for the Covered Products, IVC made no effort to pay back the duties that it had long owed to the United States because of its pervasive misclassifications.  As a result, IVC underpaid millions of dollars of duties owed to CBP for its imports. In the settlement agreement, IVC admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for the following conduct: During the Covered Period, IVC’s customs brokers used information provided by IVC to prepare and submit customs entry summaries to CBP relating to imports of the Covered Products.  IVC knew that its customs brokers would rely on the information it provided when classifying the Covered Products and preparing the entry summaries to be submitted to CBP. During the Covered Period, IVC provided its customs brokers with HTS classifications for the Covered Products that applied to medicaments and vitamins and that would incur no duties.  The Covered Products should have been classified as food preparations subject to the payment of duties.  IVC continued providing its customs brokers with these inaccurate HTS classifications even after CBP issued Notices of Action to IVC in 2016 and 2017 regarding classification errors made by IVC for similar non-Covered Products, namely, incorrectly classifying the similar non-Covered Products as duty-free when the correct classifications were for food preparations subject to duties. In the fall of 2018, IVC retained a consultant to review the HTS classifications IVC was using for all of the products IVC was then importing into the United States, including the Covered Products.  After analyzing the 134 products, the consultant provided IVC with the correct HTS classifications for each of the Covered Products.  The corrected codes carried higher duty rates than the HTS classifications IVC was using at the time.  As a result, IVC had underpaid duties on the Covered Products. IVC did not implement the corrected codes for the Covered Products that were imported into the United States on entry documentation submitted to CBP until around September 13, 2019.  Soon after, an IVC executive explained his view “that as each item is reviewed and corrected,” IVC had “a very strong go forward but the clean up is tough.”  IVC never remitted the duties it had underpaid for the Covered Products, apart from in response to several discrete Notices of Action. As a result, IVC, through its customs brokers, misclassified the Covered Products on entry documents filed with CBP and, throughout the Covered Period, routinely underpaid customs duties on the Covered Products. *                *                * In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a whistleblower lawsuit that had been previously filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. Mr. Williams thanked CBP for its investigative efforts and ongoing support and assistance with the case. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Bannon is in charge of the case.

(“SPECTRUM”).  The settlement resolves the United States’ allegations that SPECTRUM fraudulently obtained payments on two federally funded construction projects by causing misrepresentations of compliance with Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, which require participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  Specifically, the United States alleged that SPECTRUM caused the prime contractors on the projects to misrepresent that codefendant Tower Maintenance Corp. (“Tower”), a certified DBE, was solely performing work on the two projects, when in fact much of that work was performed by SPECTRUM, a non-DBE.  As part of the settlement approved yesterday by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, SPECTRUM admits and accepts responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s amended complaint and agrees to pay $400,000 to the United States. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is intended to increase participation of minority- and women-owned businesses that historically have been disadvantaged in federal contracting.  This settlement reflects this Office’s commitment to root out DBE fraud in federally funded contracts so that legitimate DBEs can compete fairly for public construction projects.” USDOT-OIG Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Brian Gallagher said: “The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program of the U.S. Department of Transportation is designed to create a level playing field for small, disadvantaged businesses to participate in federally-funded construction projects. We will hold accountable those who conspire to misrepresent their compliance with program requirements to obtain taxpayer supported contracts, thereby undermining the DBE program’s goal of expanding opportunities for small businesses.” DOI Commissioner Margaret Garnett said: “This settlement rightly holds accountable a subcontractor that intentionally deceived the government and blatantly disregarded the regulations in place to ensure equal access by disadvantaged-owned businesses. Developing a fair and equal environment is how we do business in New York City and that is why contractors must follow the laws advancing participation by minority- and women-owned businesses. DOI thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the rest of our law enforcement partners on this matter for this successful result.” MTA Inspector General Carolyn Pokorny said: “It is outrageous and against the law to use a minority- or women-owned business as a front to swindle precious taxpayer dollars from the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which is meant to ensure an equal playing field for DBEs.  This scheme was an affront to taxpayers, MTA riders, and the many honest DBEs that legitimately qualify for the federal program that these companies defrauded.  I am proud to stand with our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of this vital program.” As alleged in the amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in August 2019, SPECTRUM performed steel painting work on two federally funded projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza.  Contracts for both projects required codefendant Ahern Painting Contractors Co. (“Ahern”) to hire DBEs to perform a percentage of the work and to adhere to the DBE regulations.  SPECTRUM was not a certified DBE, so SPECTRUM and Tower used Tower’s status as a DBE to take credit for work that was performed, managed, and supervised by SPECTRUM.  Further, to conceal this scheme, SPECTRUM employees represented themselves as Tower employees in project documents.  The case against Ahern was resolved in a settlement approved by Judge Torres in October 2019, and the case against Tower is ongoing. As part of the settlement, SPECTRUM admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct alleged in the amended complaint: In or about March 2010, a manager at Spectrum (the “Spectrum Manager”) and a principal at Tower agreed that the two firms would work together on the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  Pursuant to that agreement, the Spectrum Manager conducted a walk-through of the Brooklyn Bridge worksite with the Tower principal and an Ahern superintendent for the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  The Spectrum Manager understood the he participated in the walk-through to assist Tower in preparing the bid Tower later submitted to Ahern for its anticipated work as a DBE subcontractor for the Brooklyn Bridge project. In May and June 2011, SPECTRUM and Tower memorialized two “consulting agreements” for work on the Brooklyn Bridge and the Queens Plaza Projects.  Pursuant to those agreements, SPECTRUM and Tower agreed that SPECTRUM would “perform certain consulting services,” including “providing project management support,” and would furnish equipment to Tower for the two projects.  The agreements further provided that SPECTRUM would receive 50% of all profits from the Tower DBE work on the projects. The key terms of the consulting agreements between Tower and SPECTRUM – including Tower’s agreement to pay SPECTRUM 50 percent of all of its profits from the two projects, or SPECTRUM’s agreement to furnish equipment to Tower for the projects – were not disclosed to Ahern, NYC-DOT, or MTA. Throughout the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, the SPECTRUM Manager managed and supervised the DBE work that Tower was retained to perform on each project, such as setting the work schedule, ordering materials for the work, hiring the foreman, inspecting the work performed, and coordinating payment for the work. The SPECTRUM Manager also hired other supervisors on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects.  For example, the SPECTRUM Manager hired the superintendent for the DBE work assigned to Tower for the Brooklyn Bridge Project and the Queens Plaza Project (the “SPECTRUM Superintendent”).  The SPECTRUM Manager also hired an individual to oversee health and safety issues related to the DBE work on the two projects (the “SPECTRUM Safety Supervisor”).  Both the SPECTRUM Superintendent and the SPECTRUM Safety Supervisor were paid by SPECTRUM and not by Tower. The SPECTRUM Manager, SPECTRUM Superintendent, and SPECTRUM Safety Supervisor were all SPECTRUM employees.  On the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, they identified themselves to others working on the projects as Tower employees, including by wearing Tower vests and security identification.  In documents submitted to Ahern to obtain security clearances, the SPECTRUM Manager identified himself as a “Tower VP” or as a Tower employee. Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the USDOT-OIG, DOI, and MTA-OIG. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mónica P.

Spectrum Painting stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal [PDF, ] Topic Civil Rights Component USAO - New York, Southern Press Release Number: 21-173 Manhattan U.S. Attorney Settles Fraud Suit Against Spectrum Painting For False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation On Federal Construction Projects Manhattan U.S. Attorney Settles Fraud Suit Against Spectrum Painting For False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation On Federal Construction Projects Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email Audrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Brian Gallagher, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Northeastern Region, United States Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General (“USDOT-OIG”), Margaret Garnett, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation (“DOI”), and Carolyn Pokorny, Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA-OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled civil fraud claims against New York-area painting contractor SPECTRUM PAINTING CORP. (“SPECTRUM”).  The settlement resolves the United States’ allegations that SPECTRUM fraudulently obtained payments on two federally funded construction projects by causing misrepresentations of compliance with Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, which require participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  Specifically, the United States alleged that SPECTRUM caused the prime contractors on the projects to misrepresent that codefendant Tower Maintenance Corp. (“Tower”), a certified DBE, was solely performing work on the two projects, when in fact much of that work was performed by SPECTRUM, a non-DBE.  As part of the settlement approved yesterday by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, SPECTRUM admits and accepts responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s amended complaint and agrees to pay $400,000 to the United States. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is intended to increase participation of minority- and women-owned businesses that historically have been disadvantaged in federal contracting.  This settlement reflects this Office’s commitment to root out DBE fraud in federally funded contracts so that legitimate DBEs can compete fairly for public construction projects.” USDOT-OIG Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Brian Gallagher said: “The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program of the U.S. Department of Transportation is designed to create a level playing field for small, disadvantaged businesses to participate in federally-funded construction projects. We will hold accountable those who conspire to misrepresent their compliance with program requirements to obtain taxpayer supported contracts, thereby undermining the DBE program’s goal of expanding opportunities for small businesses.” DOI Commissioner Margaret Garnett said: “This settlement rightly holds accountable a subcontractor that intentionally deceived the government and blatantly disregarded the regulations in place to ensure equal access by disadvantaged-owned businesses. Developing a fair and equal environment is how we do business in New York City and that is why contractors must follow the laws advancing participation by minority- and women-owned businesses. DOI thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the rest of our law enforcement partners on this matter for this successful result.” MTA Inspector General Carolyn Pokorny said: “It is outrageous and against the law to use a minority- or women-owned business as a front to swindle precious taxpayer dollars from the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which is meant to ensure an equal playing field for DBEs.  This scheme was an affront to taxpayers, MTA riders, and the many honest DBEs that legitimately qualify for the federal program that these companies defrauded.  I am proud to stand with our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of this vital program.” As alleged in the amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in August 2019, SPECTRUM performed steel painting work on two federally funded projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza.  Contracts for both projects required codefendant Ahern Painting Contractors Co.

(“TOYOTA”) for systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions. Along with the civil complaint, the United States has filed a consent decree, agreed to by TOYOTA, that resolves the government’s complaint through TOYOTA’s payment of a $180 million civil penalty and the imposition of injunctive relief.  The $180 million penalty is the largest civil penalty for violation of EPA’s emission-reporting requirements.  The injunctive provisions require TOYOTA to follow compliance and reporting practices designed to ensure timely investigation of emission-related defects and timely reporting to EPA, and include training, communication, and oversight requirements.  The consent decree remains subject to a period of public comment and Court approval. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “For a decade, Toyota systematically violated regulations that provide EPA with a critical compliance tool to ensure that vehicles on the road comply with federal emissions standards.  Toyota shut its eyes to the noncompliance, failing to provide proper training, attention, and oversight to its Clean Air Act reporting obligations.  Toyota’s actions undermined EPA’s self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants.  Today, Toyota pays the price for its misconduct with a $180 million civil penalty and agreement to injunctive relief to ensure that its violations will not be repeated.” Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark said:  “This settlement is yet another important milestone settlement for this Administration, and it continues our unwavering commitment to ensuring that our environmental laws as written, including EPA’s regulations, are rigorously enforced. EPA Assistant Administrator Susan Bodine stated:  “For a decade Toyota failed to report mandatory information about potential defects in their cars to the EPA, keeping the agency in the dark and evading oversight.  EPA considers this failure to be a serious violation of the Clean Air Act.” The complaint filed in Manhattan federal court today alleges that from approximately 2005 until at least late 2015, TOYOTA systematically violated Clean Air Act automobile defect reporting requirements designed to protect public health and the environment from harmful air pollutants. Clean Air Act regulations require manufacturers to notify EPA by filing an Emissions Defect Information Report (“EDIR”) when 25 or more vehicles or engines in a given model year have the same defect in an emission control part or an element of design installed in order to comply with emission standards and other EPA regulations.  The regulations also require vehicle manufacturers to file a Voluntary Emissions Recall Report (“VERR”) with EPA when they perform a recall to correct defects in emission-related parts, and to update EPA on the progress of such recalls through Quarterly Reports.  These mandatory reporting requirements are critical to the Clean Air Act’s purpose of protecting human health and the environment from harmful air pollutants:  They encourage manufacturers to investigate and voluntarily address defects that may result in excess emissions of harmful air pollutants, and provide EPA with important information about emission-related defects for use in its oversight of manufacturers. For 10 years, TOYOTA routinely failed to comply with these reporting requirements.  During that time, TOYOTA materially delayed filing an estimated 78 EDIRs, filing many only when disclosing non-compliance to EPA in 2015, at which point some were as much as eight years late.  These EDIRs related to millions of vehicles with the potential to exhibit emission-related defects.  TOYOTA also failed to file 20 VERRs and more than 200 Quarterly Reports. During the period of noncompliance, TOYOTA managers and staff in Japan knew that TOYOTA was no longer even attempting to determine whether it was aware of 25 instances of the same emission-related defect in a model year – the threshold requirement for filing an EDIR.  Rather than follow this legally required standard, TOYOTA unilaterally decided to file EDIRs principally when TOYOTA was required to file distinct reports with California regulators under a less strict standard – a standard that EPA had rejected as too lenient when TOYOTA had previously proposed to rely on it for federal reporting.  TOYOTA managers and staff in Japan repeatedly identified the discrepancy between TOYOTA’s procedures and the plain language of the federal requirements, but failed to bring TOYOTA into compliance. As a result of its conduct, TOYOTA deprived EPA of timely information regarding emission-related defects and recalls, and avoided the early focus on emission defects contemplated by the regulations.  TOYOTA’s conduct likely resulted in delayed or avoided recalls, with TOYOTA obtaining a significant economic benefit, pushing costs onto consumers, and lengthening the time that unrepaired vehicles with emission-related defects remained on the road. *                *                * In the consent decree lodged with the federal court today, TOYOTA admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following: Between approximately 2005 and late 2015, TOYOTA routinely filed emission defect reports to EPA materially late and, in many cases, failed to file such reports at all until a self-disclosure of non-compliance in late 2015. Representations to EPA In March and May 2002, at EPA’s request, TOYOTA and EPA representatives met to discuss TOYOTA’s internal process for identifying whether 25 instances of a specific emission-related defect exist in vehicles or engines of the same model year, requiring an EDIR filing. At a first meeting in March 2002, TOYOTA described its EDIR process in which TOYOTA would investigate whether it had 25 defects only upon receiving 25 “product reports” from its dealers, but would supplement that review by filing an EDIR upon receiving warranty claims for an emission-related part in 4% of TOYOTA’s California fleet (a threshold requiring a separate filing to state authorities under California law). At the meeting, EPA rejected this EDIR process as not timely considering warranty claims, despite the incorporation of the 4% California trigger. At a May 2002 meeting with EPA, Toyota presented its revised process.  Under that process, Toyota would commence an investigation to determine whether an EDIR filing was required when it had received warranty claims for an emission-related part for 1% of relevant vehicles nationwide; when it received 500 such warranty claims regardless of the percentage; or when it received 25 similar early warning reports. TOYOTA noted internally that EPA seemed pleased with this approach, which EPA had described as “more stringent than California.” In 2003, 2004, and 2005, as part of an annual review, TOYOTA submitted its May 2002 process in writing to EPA as an overview of its EDIR reporting program. TOYOTA’s Conduct from Approximately 2005 to 2015 Without notifying EPA, in approximately 2005, TOYOTA stopped following the May 2002 EDIR process. In approximately 2005, TOYOTA began filing EDIRs primarily when filing the California reports triggered by the 4% threshold.  TOYOTA also filed EDIRs in a small number of instances when it was otherwise filing VERRs with EPA. From approximately 2005 to 2015, TOYOTA stopped making any independent determination of whether 25 defects existed requiring an EDIR filing. Multiple times during this period, TOYOTA staff charged with preparing EDIRs identified that the plain language of the EDIR regulations called for filing an EDIR upon the identification of 25 defects, but that TOYOTA was not doing so.  These staff did not cause TOYOTA to change its practice. As a result of this conduct, TOYOTA filed at least 69 EDIRs materially late.  Thirty-nine of these were filed materially late in the ordinary course of TOYOTA’s business.  In late 2015, TOYOTA self-disclosed another 30 that had not been filed at all.  Some EDIRs were ultimately filed as many as eight years after they were due. Beyond EDIRs, TOYOTA also failed during this period to file 20 VERRs required for emission-related recall campaigns that it conducted and failed to file more than 200 Quarterly Reports related to such campaigns. Between 2005 and 2015, TOYOTA failed to provide its employees with adequate training, resources, or oversight to ensure that TOYOTA complied with its reporting obligations to EPA. As a result of TOYOTA’s conduct, EPA did not timely receive mandated information regarding emission-related defects and recalls. Notice of the proposed consent decree will be published in the Federal Register and the public will have the opportunity to submit comments on the consent decree for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval. Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss thanked the attorneys in EPA’s Air Enforcement Division, the program staff at EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, and the agents at EPA’s Criminal Investigative Division for their critical work on this case.  Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss also thanked the ENRD attorneys who assisted in the matter. This case is being handled by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert William Yalen, Dominika Tarczynska, and Jennifer Jude are in charge of the case.

Toyota complaint [PDF, ] Topic Environment Component USAO - New York, Southern Press Release Number: 21-007 Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces $180 Million Settlement Of Suit Against Toyota Motor Corporation For Decade-Long Noncompliance With Clean Air Act Reporting Requirements Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces $180 Million Settlement Of Suit Against Toyota Motor Corporation For Decade-Long Noncompliance With Clean Air Act Reporting Requirements Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division (“ENRD”) of the U.S. Department of Justice, and Susan Bodine, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today that the United States has filed and simultaneously settled a civil lawsuit against TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION, TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA, INC., TOYOTA MOTOR SALES, U.S.A., INC., and TOYOTA MOTOR ENGINEERING & MANUFACTURING NORTH AMERICA, INC. (“TOYOTA”) for systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions. Along with the civil complaint, the United States has filed a consent decree, agreed to by TOYOTA, that resolves the government’s complaint through TOYOTA’s payment of a $180 million civil penalty and the imposition of injunctive relief.  The $180 million penalty is the largest civil penalty for violation of EPA’s emission-reporting requirements.  The injunctive provisions require TOYOTA to follow compliance and reporting practices designed to ensure timely investigation of emission-related defects and timely reporting to EPA, and include training, communication, and oversight requirements.  The consent decree remains subject to a period of public comment and Court approval. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “For a decade, Toyota systematically violated regulations that provide EPA with a critical compliance tool to ensure that vehicles on the road comply with federal emissions standards.  Toyota shut its eyes to the noncompliance, failing to provide proper training, attention, and oversight to its Clean Air Act reporting obligations.  Toyota’s actions undermined EPA’s self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants.  Today, Toyota pays the price for its misconduct with a $180 million civil penalty and agreement to injunctive relief to ensure that its violations will not be repeated.” Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark said:  “This settlement is yet another important milestone settlement for this Administration, and it continues our unwavering commitment to ensuring that our environmental laws as written, including EPA’s regulations, are rigorously enforced. EPA Assistant Administrator Susan Bodine stated:  “For a decade Toyota failed to report mandatory information about potential defects in their cars to the EPA, keeping the agency in the dark and evading oversight.  EPA considers this failure to be a serious violation of the Clean Air Act.” The complaint filed in Manhattan federal court today alleges that from approximately 2005 until at least late 2015, TOYOTA systematically violated Clean Air Act automobile defect reporting requirements designed to protect public health and the environment from harmful air pollutants. Clean Air Act regulations require manufacturers to notify EPA by filing an Emissions Defect Information Report (“EDIR”) when 25 or more vehicles or engines in a given model year have the same defect in an emission control part or an element of design installed in order to comply with emission standards and other EPA regulations.  The regulations also require vehicle manufacturers to file a Voluntary Emissions Recall Report (“VERR”) with EPA when they perform a recall to correct defects in emission-related parts, and to update EPA on the progress of such recalls through Quarterly Reports.  These mandatory reporting requirements are critical to the Clean Air Act’s purpose of protecting human health and the environment from harmful air pollutants:  They encourage manufacturers to investigate and voluntarily address defects that may result in excess emissions of harmful air pollutants, and provide EPA with important information about emission-related defects for use in its oversight of manufacturers. For 10 years, TOYOTA routinely failed to comply with these reporting requirements.  During that time, TOYOTA materially delayed filing an estimated 78 EDIRs, filing many only when disclosing non-compliance to EPA in 2015, at which point some were as much as eight years late.  These EDIRs related to millions of vehicles with the potential to exhibit emission-related defects.  TOYOTA also failed to file 20 VERRs and more than 200 Quarterly Reports. During the period of noncompliance, TOYOTA managers and staff in Japan knew that TOYOTA was no longer even attempting to determine whether it was aware of 25 instances of the same emission-related defect in a model year – the threshold requirement for filing an EDIR.  Rather than follow this legally required standard, TOYOTA unilaterally decided to file EDIRs principally when TOYOTA was required to file distinct reports with California regulators under a less strict standard – a standard that EPA had rejected as too lenient when TOYOTA had previously proposed to rely on it for federal reporting.  TOYOTA managers and staff in Japan repeatedly identified the discrepancy between TOYOTA’s procedures and the plain language of the federal requirements, but failed to bring TOYOTA into compliance. As a result of its conduct, TOYOTA deprived EPA of timely information regarding emission-related defects and recalls, and avoided the early focus on emission defects contemplated by the regulations.  TOYOTA’s conduct likely resulted in delayed or avoided recalls, with TOYOTA obtaining a significant economic benefit, pushing costs onto consumers, and lengthening the time that unrepaired vehicles with emission-related defects remained on the road. *                *                * In the consent decree lodged with the federal court today, TOYOTA admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following: Between approximately 2005 and late 2015, TOYOTA routinely filed emission defect reports to EPA materially late and, in many cases, failed to file such reports at all until a self-disclosure of non-compliance in late 2015. Representations to EPA In March and May 2002, at EPA’s request, TOYOTA and EPA representatives met to discuss TOYOTA’s internal process for identifying whether 25 instances of a specific emission-related defect exist in vehicles or engines of the same model year, requiring an EDIR filing. At a first meeting in March 2002, TOYOTA described its EDIR process in which TOYOTA would investigate whether it had 25 defects only upon receiving 25 “product reports” from its dealers, but would supplement that review by filing an EDIR upon receiving warranty claims for an emission-related part in 4% of TOYOTA’s California fleet (a threshold requiring a separate filing to state authorities under California law). At the meeting, EPA rejected this EDIR process as not timely considering warranty claims, despite the incorporation of the 4% California trigger. At a May 2002 meeting with EPA, Toyota presented its revised process.  Under that process, Toyota would commence an investigation to determine whether an EDIR filing was required when it had received warranty claims for an emission-related part for 1% of relevant vehicles nationwide; when it received 500 such warranty claims regardless of the percentage; or when it received 25 similar early warning reports. TOYOTA noted internally that EPA seemed pleased with this approach, which EPA had described as “more stringent than California.” In 2003, 2004, and 2005, as part of an annual review, TOYOTA submitted its May 2002 process in writing to EPA as an overview of its EDIR reporting program. TOYOTA’s Conduct from Approximately 2005 to 2015 Without notifying EPA, in approximately 2005, TOYOTA stopped following the May 2002 EDIR process. In approximately 2005, TOYOTA began filing EDIRs primarily when filing the California reports triggered by the 4% threshold.  TOYOTA also filed EDIRs in a small number of instances when it was otherwise filing VERRs with EPA. From approximately 2005 to 2015, TOYOTA stopped making any independent determination of whether 25 defects existed requiring an EDIR filing. Multiple times during this period, TOYOTA staff charged with preparing EDIRs identified that the plain language of the EDIR regulations called for filing an EDIR upon the identification of 25 defects, but that TOYOTA was not doing so.  These staff did not cause TOYOTA to change its practice. As a result of this conduct, TOYOTA filed at least 69 EDIRs materially late.  Thirty-nine of these were filed materially late in the ordinary course of TOYOTA’s business.  In late 2015, TOYOTA self-disclosed another 30 that had not been filed at all.  Some EDIRs were ultimately filed as many as eight years after they were due. Beyond EDIRs, TOYOTA also failed during this period to file 20 VERRs required for emission-related recall campaigns that it conducted and failed to file more than 200 Quarterly Reports related to such campaigns. Between 2005 and 2015, TOYOTA failed to provide its employees with adequate training, resources, or oversight to ensure that TOYOTA complied with its reporting obligations to EPA. As a result of TOYOTA’s conduct, EPA did not timely receive mandated information regarding emission-related defects and recalls. Notice of the proposed consent decree will be published in the Federal Register and the public will have the opportunity to submit comments on the consent decree for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval. Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss thanked the attorneys in EPA’s Air Enforcement Division, the program staff at EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, and the agents at EPA’s Criminal Investigative Division for their critical work on this case.  Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss also thanked the ENRD attorneys who assisted in the matter.

Driscoll, the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), announced today that the United States has simultaneously filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo” or the “Bank”) alleging that it violated the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”) by fraudulently overcharging hundreds of commercial customers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses and federally-insured financial institutions, who used the Bank’s foreign exchange (“FX”) service.  Specifically, the United States alleged that, from 2010 through 2017, Wells Fargo FX sales specialists defrauded 771 customers by systematically charging them higher markups on FX transactions than they represented the Bank would charge, and concealing these overcharges through various misrepresentations and deceptive practices. As part of the settlement, approved today by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, Wells Fargo will pay a total of approximately $72.6 million, with approximately $35.3 million having been paid directly to the 771 customers collectively as restitution and approximately $37.3 million to be paid to the United States as civil penalties under FIRREA and as asset forfeiture.  Wells Fargo also made extensive admissions of certain conduct alleged in the Government’s complaint, including that many FX sales specialists overcharged hundreds of commercial customers by applying larger sales margins or spreads than they represented they would, and that, in certain instances, when customers contacted the Bank to inquire about higher-than-agreed-upon pricing, FX sales specialists would give customers false explanations for the inflated prices. U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “We all put trust in our banking institutions to deal with us honestly, fairly, and transparently when we are their customers.  For the better part of a decade, Wells Fargo abused this trust, using tricks, false information, and other deceptive practices to fraudulently overcharge customers who used the Bank’s foreign exchange service.  This settlement, which requires Wells Fargo to make its customers whole for their losses and pay a substantial penalty, sends a strong message to the banking industry that financial institutions who take advantage of their customers will be held to account.” As alleged in the Government’s complaint: During 2010 through 2017 (the “Covered Period”), Wells Fargo offered FX services to commercial customers located throughout the United States, such as converting the customers’ US dollars into foreign currency for outgoing wire transfers and converting incoming wire transfers of foreign currency into U.S. dollars.  Wells Fargo profited from these transactions by marking up the prices on currency it was selling to and marking down the prices on currency it was buying from its customers.  Wells Fargo employees referred internally to this currency mark-up as a “spread” or “sales margin.”  Wells Fargo FX sales specialists frequently entered into agreements with the Bank’s customers pursuant to which they represented that the Bank would charge specific spreads or sales margins on their FX transactions.  These agreements, referred to internally as “fixed-pricing agreements,” were both written and oral in nature. During the Covered Period, Wells Fargo defrauded 771 of its commercial customers with fixed-pricing agreements, many of them small or medium-sized companies and federally-insured financial institutions, by falsely representing to the customers that the Bank would charge specific fixed FX spreads on FX transactions, when, in fact, Wells Fargo was surreptitiously and systematically charging significantly higher spreads and pocketing tens of millions of dollars in ill-gotten FX revenue.  By financially incentivizing its FX sales specialists to overcharge FX customers while failing to take steps to ensure that FX sales specialists honored pricing representations, Wells Fargo created an atmosphere in which employees openly joked about and celebrated taking advantage of the Bank’s customers. Wells Fargo FX sales specialists used a variety of misrepresentations and deceptive practices to defraud customers.  For example, instead of applying agreed-upon fixed spreads to customers’ outgoing wires, FX sales specialists would charge inflated spreads that were as large as the FX sales specialists thought they could get away with.  Furthermore, rather than charging the agreed-upon fixed spread to the FX market rate at the time the outgoing wire was converted, FX sales specialists would select the best rate for the Bank and worst rate for the customer from the FX price fluctuations from the beginning of the trading day until the time of the transaction.  This practice was referred to internally as “Range of Day” Pricing. In addition, FX sales specialists sometimes would give customers fictitious underlying FX market rates and spread calculations to create the false impression that Wells Fargo was complying with pricing representations when that was not the case. Other times, FX sales specialists would make intentional “errors” to the exchange rate given to a customer to make the Bank’s spread much larger.  If caught, the FX sales specialist would falsely claim that digits in the price had been mistakenly transposed.  This practice was known as the “Big Figure Trick.” FX sales specialists also at times would charge a customer different spreads depending on which customer representative initiated the transaction.  Because Wells Fargo’s online FX service tracked user identities, FX sales specialists would impose larger spreads on transactions initiated by those representatives thought to be less sophisticated or experienced in FX trading.  This practice was known internally as “User-Based Pricing.” FX sales specialists frequently would apply an even more egregious form of Range of Day pricing to customers’ incoming wire transfers, called “BSwift” wires.  Because Wells Fargo generally did not notify customers when they received incoming wires of foreign currency or when those wires were converted, FX sales specialist could wait until the end of the day and select the best rate for the Bank and worst rate for the customer from price fluctuations throughout the entire trading day.  One FX specialist called this practice the “BSwift Pinata.” As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo admitted and accepted responsibility for the following conduct: During the Covered Period, many FX sales specialists overcharged hundreds of commercial customers by applying larger sales margins or spreads to customer FX transactions than they represented they would. Wells Fargo received millions of dollars from customers to which the Bank was not entitled. FX sales specialists internally discussed and even celebrated transactions resulting in larger FX spreads than agreed to with customers or transactions generating large FX revenue.  For example, FX sales specialists on Wells Fargo’s San Francisco FX desk would celebrate transactions with large spreads or sales margins by ringing a bell located on the trading floor.  Other FX sales specialists would use expressions such as, “back the truck up,” and “when in doubt, spread them out,” to jokingly describe how Wells Fargo and its FX sales specialists were making money on transactions by charging large FX spreads, including larger FX spreads than agreed to with customers. Wells Fargo’s own internal CMR database indicated that FX sales specialists were charging customers FX spreads that were higher than those the Bank had represented.  Certain CMR notes reflected that while a customer thought it would receive the rate that the Bank had represented to the customer, the Bank in fact charged the customer undisclosed higher spreads.  For example, an FX sales specialist stated in one CMR note concerning Customer A that there was an “agreement w/the customer” to charge “25 pips [points in percentage]on spot trades” but that the Bank would “take 30-35 . . . if possible.” False Information In certain instances, when customers contacted the Bank to inquire about higher-than-agreed-upon pricing, FX sales specialists would give false explanations for the prices such as “time fluctuations” or other supposed events in the market. In a few cases, FX sales specialists provided customers false transaction data.  In one instance, an FX sales specialist represented to Customer E that it would charge a spread of 5 basis points on certain BSwift wire transactions.  Contrary to this agreement, the Bank actually charged higher spreads on a series of FX transactions.  Then, in email correspondence with representatives of Customer E, the FX sales specialist provided inaccurate market rate information to the customer to make the FX spread falsely appear consistent with the agreement terms. The Big Figure Trick For some customers, FX sales specialists also used what they internally called the “big figure trick” or the “transposition error game” to increase the FX sales margin by switching digits in the price of the transactions in a way that would cost customers more money.  For example, if the correct hypothetical price to purchase a Euro was 1.0123 dollars, an FX sales specialist would use the big figure trick to switch the price to 1.0213 dollars, thus taking more spread (in this example, an additional 89 basis points) from the customer. If caught by the customer, the FX sales specialist would claim that it was simply a mistake of adjusting the wrong digit in the price.  One FX sales specialist explained, “You can play the transposition error game if you get called out.”  Another FX sales specialist noted to a colleague about a previous transaction that a customer “didn’t flinch at the big fig the other day.  Want to take a bit more?” User-Based Pricing At times, Wells Fargo’s FX sales specialists charged the same customers different spreads depending on which representative of the customer happened to be involved in executing the trade.  Specifically, Wells Fargo’s FX sales specialists would charge larger spreads on transactions requested by certain customer representatives thought to be less sophisticated or experienced in FX trading. BSwift Piñata As noted above, because Wells Fargo generally did not provide immediate notice to customers when they received incoming wires, known as BSwifts, Wells Fargo’s FX sales specialists took advantage of this time delay to charge higher spreads than the Bank had represented it would. An FX sales specialist in a written instant message to another sales specialist referred to the Bank’s pricing of BSwift wire transfers as the “BSWIFT pinata.” An additional FX sales specialist noted in a recorded call that she preferred to book her own BSwifts to stretch the spread and could take more spread because she was doing the pricing herself.  She observed that she could “dance around it” if the customer called with questions. Another FX sales specialist observed in an internal email communication that customers would not notice higher spreads on BSwift wires.  He wrote, after noting that he “bumped spreads up a pinch,” that “these clients who are in the mode of just processing wires will most likely not notice this slight change in pricing” and that it “could have a very quick positive impact on revenue without a lot of risk.” Financial Incentives and Lack of Meaningful or Effective Oversight Wells Fargo incentivized its FX sales specialists to generate FX sales revenue by tying their bonuses exclusively to the amount of sales revenue they generated for the Bank from FX transactions.  Specifically, before 2017, Wells Fargo paid bonuses to FX sales specialists based upon the percentage of the FX sales revenue that each FX sales specialist and FX desk generated.  Each year during the Covered Period, Wells Fargo paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses to various FX sales specialists based on FX revenue.  Some FX sales specialists received bonus compensation exceeding $1 million in a single year. Prior to 2017, Wells Fargo failed to put meaningful or effective safeguards in place to ensure that FX sales specialists priced customer FX transactions in accordance with the terms represented in fixed-pricing agreements.  For example, during the Covered Period, Wells Fargo:  (i) had no meaningful or effective policies or procedures governing how fixed-pricing agreements should be negotiated, memorialized, recorded, or implemented; (ii) provided no training to FX sales specialists concerning fixed-pricing agreements; (iii) had no meaningful or effective process to systematically track the existence or terms of fixed-pricing agreements; (iv) had no systemic process in place to monitor whether FX sales specialists were pricing FX transactions in a manner that was consistent with fixed-pricing agreements; (v) did not implement any electronic safeguards that would have prevented FX sales specialists from pricing transactions in a manner that deviated from fixed-pricing agreements; and (vi) did not conduct any audits or reviews of FX transactions to determine whether FX pricing matched fixed-pricing agreements until 2017. *                *                * In the settlement, Wells Fargo acknowledged that it took adverse employment actions against more than 20 Wells Fargo employees who were involved in the FX business, including various disciplinary actions and separation of employment, and affirmed that it has taken various steps in an effort to comply with industry FX best practices.This matter was initially brought to the Government’s attention by a whistleblower who filed a confidential declaration with the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the Financial Institutions Anti-Fraud Enforcement Act. Ms. Strauss praised the investigative work of the FBI. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lawrence H. Fogelman and Pierre G. Armand are in charge of the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Wilson of the Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit is responsible for the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Wells Fargo FX sales specialists used a variety of misrepresentations and deceptive practices to defraud customers.  For example, instead of applying agreed-upon fixed spreads to customers’ outgoing wires, FX sales specialists would charge inflated spreads that were as large as the FX sales specialists thought they could get away with.  Furthermore, rather than charging the agreed-upon fixed spread to the FX market rate at the time the outgoing wire was converted, FX sales specialists would select the best rate for the Bank and worst rate for the customer from the FX price fluctuations from the beginning of the trading day until the time of the transaction.  This practice was referred to internally as “Range of Day” Pricing. In addition, FX sales specialists sometimes would give customers fictitious underlying FX market rates and spread calculations to create the false impression that Wells Fargo was complying with pricing representations when that was not the case. Other times, FX sales specialists would make intentional “errors” to the exchange rate given to a customer to make the Bank’s spread much larger.  If caught, the FX sales specialist would falsely claim that digits in the price had been mistakenly transposed.  This practice was known as the “Big Figure Trick.” FX sales specialists also at times would charge a customer different spreads depending on which customer representative initiated the transaction.  Because Wells Fargo’s online FX service tracked user identities, FX sales specialists would impose larger spreads on transactions initiated by those representatives thought to be less sophisticated or experienced in FX trading.  This practice was known internally as “User-Based Pricing.” FX sales specialists frequently would apply an even more egregious form of Range of Day pricing to customers’ incoming wire transfers, called “BSwift” wires.  Because Wells Fargo generally did not notify customers when they received incoming wires of foreign currency or when those wires were converted, FX sales specialist could wait until the end of the day and select the best rate for the Bank and worst rate for the customer from price fluctuations throughout the entire trading day.  One FX specialist called this practice the “BSwift Pinata.” As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo admitted and accepted responsibility for the following conduct: During the Covered Period, many FX sales specialists overcharged hundreds of commercial customers by applying larger sales margins or spreads to customer FX transactions than they represented they would. Wells Fargo received millions of dollars from customers to which the Bank was not entitled. FX sales specialists internally discussed and even celebrated transactions resulting in larger FX spreads than agreed to with customers or transactions generating large FX revenue.  For example, FX sales specialists on Wells Fargo’s San Francisco FX desk would celebrate transactions with large spreads or sales margins by ringing a bell located on the trading floor.  Other FX sales specialists would use expressions such as, “back the truck up,” and “when in doubt, spread them out,” to jokingly describe how Wells Fargo and its FX sales specialists were making money on transactions by charging large FX spreads, including larger FX spreads than agreed to with customers. Wells Fargo’s own internal CMR database indicated that FX sales specialists were charging customers FX spreads that were higher than those the Bank had represented.  Certain CMR notes reflected that while a customer thought it would receive the rate that the Bank had represented to the customer, the Bank in fact charged the customer undisclosed higher spreads.  For example, an FX sales specialist stated in one CMR note concerning Customer A that there was an “agreement w/the customer” to charge “25 pips [points in percentage]on spot trades” but that the Bank would “take 30-35 . . . if possible.” During the Covered Period, many FX sales specialists overcharged hundreds of commercial customers by applying larger sales margins or spreads to customer FX transactions than they represented they would.

In a few cases, FX sales specialists provided customers false transaction data.  In one instance, an FX sales specialist represented to Customer E that it would charge a spread of 5 basis points on certain BSwift wire transactions.  Contrary to this agreement, the Bank actually charged higher spreads on a series of FX transactions.  Then, in email correspondence with representatives of Customer E, the FX sales specialist provided inaccurate market rate information to the customer to make the FX spread falsely appear consistent with the agreement terms.

The Big Figure Trick For some customers, FX sales specialists also used what they internally called the “big figure trick” or the “transposition error game” to increase the FX sales margin by switching digits in the price of the transactions in a way that would cost customers more money.  For example, if the correct hypothetical price to purchase a Euro was 1.0123 dollars, an FX sales specialist would use the big figure trick to switch the price to 1.0213 dollars, thus taking more spread (in this example, an additional 89 basis points) from the customer. If caught by the customer, the FX sales specialist would claim that it was simply a mistake of adjusting the wrong digit in the price.  One FX sales specialist explained, “You can play the transposition error game if you get called out.”  Another FX sales specialist noted to a colleague about a previous transaction that a customer “didn’t flinch at the big fig the other day.  Want to take a bit more?” For some customers, FX sales specialists also used what they internally called the “big figure trick” or the “transposition error game” to increase the FX sales margin by switching digits in the price of the transactions in a way that would cost customers more money.  For example, if the correct hypothetical price to purchase a Euro was 1.0123 dollars, an FX sales specialist would use the big figure trick to switch the price to 1.0213 dollars, thus taking more spread (in this example, an additional 89 basis points) from the customer.

BSwift Piñata As noted above, because Wells Fargo generally did not provide immediate notice to customers when they received incoming wires, known as BSwifts, Wells Fargo’s FX sales specialists took advantage of this time delay to charge higher spreads than the Bank had represented it would. An FX sales specialist in a written instant message to another sales specialist referred to the Bank’s pricing of BSwift wire transfers as the “BSWIFT pinata.” An additional FX sales specialist noted in a recorded call that she preferred to book her own BSwifts to stretch the spread and could take more spread because she was doing the pricing herself.  She observed that she could “dance around it” if the customer called with questions. Another FX sales specialist observed in an internal email communication that customers would not notice higher spreads on BSwift wires.  He wrote, after noting that he “bumped spreads up a pinch,” that “these clients who are in the mode of just processing wires will most likely not notice this slight change in pricing” and that it “could have a very quick positive impact on revenue without a lot of risk.” As noted above, because Wells Fargo generally did not provide immediate notice to customers when they received incoming wires, known as BSwifts, Wells Fargo’s FX sales specialists took advantage of this time delay to charge higher spreads than the Bank had represented it would.

Prior to 2017, Wells Fargo failed to put meaningful or effective safeguards in place to ensure that FX sales specialists priced customer FX transactions in accordance with the terms represented in fixed-pricing agreements.  For example, during the Covered Period, Wells Fargo:  (i) had no meaningful or effective policies or procedures governing how fixed-pricing agreements should be negotiated, memorialized, recorded, or implemented; (ii) provided no training to FX sales specialists concerning fixed-pricing agreements; (iii) had no meaningful or effective process to systematically track the existence or terms of fixed-pricing agreements; (iv) had no systemic process in place to monitor whether FX sales specialists were pricing FX transactions in a manner that was consistent with fixed-pricing agreements; (v) did not implement any electronic safeguards that would have prevented FX sales specialists from pricing transactions in a manner that deviated from fixed-pricing agreements; and (vi) did not conduct any audits or reviews of FX transactions to determine whether FX pricing matched fixed-pricing agreements until 2017.

Ms. Strauss praised the investigative work of the FBI. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lawrence H. Fogelman and Pierre G. Armand are in charge of the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Wilson of the Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit is responsible for the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “This is yet another lawsuit brought to enforce the rights of tenants with disabilities to live with an assistance animal.  With this resolution, we again emphasize that condominiums, cooperatives, landlords, and property managers are required by federal law to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities.” The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms and conditions of the sale or rental of, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling based on the prospective buyer or renter’s disability.  The law also mandates that reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, and services be provided when necessary to afford equal housing opportunities to persons with disabilities. According to the allegations in the Amended Complaint filed in federal court: 111 Partners is the owner of certain units in a 61-unit condominium located in New York, New York, and the landlord of the rent-controlled apartment that the Tenant occupies in the building.  The Tenant, now 58 years old, has resided in that apartment his entire life and has a long history of depression.  In 2006, the Tenant adopted a dog to help alleviate his depression and requested a reasonable accommodation to defendant’s “no pets” policy to allow him to reside with his dog in the apartment.  Defendant not only denied the request, but also initiated eviction proceedings against him.  While those proceedings were underway, in spring 2015, the Tenant was diagnosed with End Stage Renal Disease, and his depression worsened.  The Tenant promptly sought another reasonable accommodation to 111 Partners’ “no pets” policy to allow him to keep his dog in the apartment given the substantial emotional assistance the dog provided and the Tenant’s changed circumstances.  111 Partners constructively denied the request by requiring the onerous disclosure of detailed medical records and other information, despite the Tenant’s already well-substantiated request and defendant’s familiarity with his condition.  In June 2017, after his dog died and during the pendency of this litigation, the Tenant again requested a reasonable accommodation to 111 Partners’ “no pets” policy to permit him to adopt another dog for emotional support, and once again, 111 Partners constructively denied the request – requiring extensive documentation despite the fact that the Tenant had continued to provide documents, expert opinions, medical records, and sworn testimony in support of his request. Under the consent decree approved by U.S. District Court Judge Paul G. Gardephe on July 14, 2020, 111 PARTNERS must: Adopt a reasonable accommodation policy regarding requests for assistance animals; Comply with certain notice, training, and recordkeeping requirements to ensure that its employees are knowledgeable about and comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act; Allow the United States to monitor compliance with the consent decree; Dismiss all pending state court litigation against the Tenant, including the eviction proceedings commenced in 2006 regarding his request to keep an emotional support animal and termination proceedings commenced in 2019 regarding apartment conditions, and waive all claims to attorney’s fees and costs; Grant the Tenant a reasonable accommodation for the remainder of his tenancy, such that he can adopt and reside with a dog for as long as the Tenant lives in the apartment, without submitting any further reasonable accommodation requests. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Brandon Waterman is in charge of the case.

Admits to Fraudulently Using Wrong Billing Code, Paying “Draw Fees” to Physicians, and Providing Meals and Happy Hours to Physicians and Their Staff Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health, Office of Inspector General (“HHS OIG”), Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the U.S. Department of Defense - Office of Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), and Christopher Algieri, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office (“VA OIG”), announced today a $49 million settlement with PROGENITY, INC. (“PROGENITY”), a San Diego-based biotechnology company that provides molecular and diagnostic tests.  The settlement resolves claims that PROGENITY fraudulently billed federal healthcare programs for prenatal tests and provided kickbacks to physicians to induce to them to order PROGENITY tests for their patients.  The Office’s lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court alleges that PROGENITY overbilled Medicaid and the VA by fraudulently using a billing code that misrepresented the tests provided.  The lawsuit further alleges that PROGENITY provided illegal kickbacks in the form of excessive “draw fees” to physicians, meals and happy hours for physicians and their staff, and the improper reduction or waiver of patient coinsurance and deductible payments. Under the settlement approved today by U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska, PROGENITY will pay $19,449,316 to the United States to resolve the kickback claims and the Medicaid and VA fraudulent billing claims, and also makes extensive admissions regarding the company’s conduct.  PROGENITY will also pay $13,150,684 to various states to resolve these claims.  In addition, PROGENITY will pay $16.4 million to resolve similar fraudulent billing claims related to TRICARE and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program through a separate civil settlement with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California (“USAO SDCA”), and has entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with that office. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “Progenity received millions of dollars from federal healthcare programs through its fraudulent billing and kickback schemes.  The company misrepresented the tests it performed, and tried to get doctors to order Progenity tests by paying them excessive fees and providing meals and happy hours for them and their staff.  Our Office will continue to hold healthcare providers accountable when they engage in fraud and other illegal conduct.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “Kickbacks and fraudulent billing schemes undermine the integrity of our healthcare system, compromise patient care, and increase the financial burden on taxpayers.  Along with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to ensure that those billing federal health insurance programs do so in an honest manner.” DCIS Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey said:  “Ensuring the integrity of TRICARE, the U.S. Defense Department's healthcare system for military members and their families, is top priority for the DCIS.  This settlement agreement is the result of a joint effort and demonstrates the DCIS’s commitment to work with the USAO-SDNY and its law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute kickbacks and other fraudulent schemes that impact TRICARE.” VA-OIG Special Agent in Charge Christopher Algieri said:  “VA OIG will vigorously pursue those who engage in unjust kickback and billing schemes, which generate profits at the expense of veterans and taxpayers.  We appreciate the United States Attorney’s Office and our agency partners for this collaborative effort.” As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: Fraudulent Billing When submitting claims for payment, healthcare providers use Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes to identify the nature of the medical procedure or services rendered.   Government healthcare payors rely on the CPT code to determine whether the procedure or service is covered, as well as the level of reimbursement.  From March 2014 through April 2016, PROGENITY fraudulently used CPT code 88271 to seek reimbursement for noninvasive prenatal tests (“NIPTs”) that screen for genetic disorders and abnormalities when this code misrepresented the services PROGENITY actually provided.  As a result, PROGENITY received payments for non-reimbursable tests, or received substantially higher payments than it was entitled to receive.  PROGENITY knew that many patients did not meet the medical necessity criteria for NIPTs, and that it could circumvent those requirements by billing under the incorrect billing code. Kickbacks PROGENITY induced physicians to order PROGENITY tests by engaging in three kickback schemes.  First, from January 2012 through March 2016, PROGENITY paid “draw fees” to physicians or physician offices for blood specimens collected for PROGENITY tests.  These fees exceeded the fair market value of the services performed.  The total draw fees paid to physicians depended on the volume of blood specimens collected, so physicians would receive more money if they ordered more PROGENITY tests. Second, from 2012 through 2018, PROGENITY sales representatives provided food and alcohol to physicians and their staff at gatherings, including happy hours and birthday or holiday parties, that often involved little or no educational content.  For the vast majority of the relevant period, PROGENITY did not limit or even monitor the total amount its sales representatives spent on a physician.  One former sales representative spent $65,658 on meals and alcohol for physicians during a single year. Third, from January 2012 through April 2018, to market its expensive tests, PROGENITY routinely reduced or waived coinsurance and deductible payments without making the required individualized determination of financial need or reasonable collection efforts.  Sales representatives informed physicians and their staff, as well as patients, that PROGENITY would waive coinsurance and deductibles, or limit the patient’s payment to a certain maximum out-of-pocket amount.  And PROGENITY had agreements with several physicians that it would not collect any payments from their patients. As part of the settlement approved today by Judge Preska, PROGENITY admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: Miscoding : From March 2014 through April 2016, PROGENITY knowingly submitted false claims for payment to Medicaid and the VA by using CPT code 88271 to obtain reimbursement for NIPTs. PROGENITY improperly used CPT code 88271, which applies to fluorescence in situ hybridization (“FISH”) procedures, knowing that its genetic tests were cell-free DNA sequencing-based NIPTs that are not FISH procedures and that CPT code 88271 did not accurately represent the tests performed. As a result of fraudulently using CPT code 88721 and misrepresenting the type of test performed when submitting claims for payment to Medicaid and the VA for NIPTs, PROGENITY received payments for non-reimbursable tests, or received substantially higher payments than it was entitled to receive for the genetic testing services provided. Kickbacks : From January 2012 through March 2016, PROGENITY knowingly made “draw fee” payments to physicians or physicians’ offices for the collection of blood specimens for PROGENITY tests performed on federal healthcare program beneficiaries.  In total, PROGENITY paid over $1.7 million in draw fees during this period. The draw fees paid by PROGENITY exceeded the fair market value of the services performed when collecting blood specimens.  PROGENITY frequently paid physicians $20 or more for each blood draw.  PROGENITY paid dozens of physicians and physician offices thousands of dollars in above fair market draw fee payments during the relevant time period. From 2012 through 2018, PROGENITY knowingly provided meals and happy hours to physicians who ordered PROGENITY tests for federal healthcare program beneficiaries, as well to individuals who worked in physicians’ offices.  The value of these meals and happy hours exceeded Stark Law limits.  In total, PROGENITY expended millions of dollars on food and drinks for physicians and their staff during this period. During the vast majority of the relevant period, PROGENITY did not have effective systems in place to ensure that the company’s expenses for meals and happy hours for physicians and their employees complied with the Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute.  For example, PROGENITY did not (i) reliably track the amount it spent on meals and happy hours for physicians or their staff, (ii) maintain accurate sign-in sheets reflecting attendance at PROGENITY-sponsored gatherings, (iii) keep records of materials or topics that were discussed during PROGENITY-sponsored gatherings, and (iv) implement and enforce limits on the total nonmonetary compensation that could be provided to physicians. From January 2012 through April 2018, PROGENITY knowingly routinely reduced or waived federal healthcare program beneficiaries’ coinsurance and deductible payments without making the required individualized determinations of financial need or reasonable collection efforts.  PROGENITY offered to reduce or waive coinsurance and deductible payments as part of its sales efforts. In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act, which alleged that PROGENITY engaged in illegal kickback schemes.  PROGENITY has also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with HHS-OIG.  The CIA promotes compliance with the statutes, regulations, program requirements, and written directives of federal healthcare programs.  Among other things, the CIA requires that for the next five years PROGENITY must retain an Independent Review Organization to annually review the accuracy of the company’s claims for services furnished to federal healthcare program beneficiaries and monitor its arrangements with other individuals and entities. Ms. Strauss thanked HHS-OIG, VA-OIG, DCIS, USAO SDCA, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the New York State Attorney General’s Office for their assistance with the case. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey K. Powell and Kirti Vaidya Reddy are in charge of the case.

Garcia, the Regional Administrator for Region 2 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today that the United States filed a civil lawsuit against APEX BUILDING COMPANY, INC. (“APEX”) alleging violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and EPA’s Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (“RRP Rule”).  The United States simultaneously entered into a Consent Decree resolving that lawsuit.  The Consent Decree includes a $606,706 civil penalty, the second largest civil penalty ever imposed under the RRP Rule, and requires APEX to take steps to mitigate potential harms caused by its conduct. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Apex’s conduct threatened to expose people, including children, to toxic lead paint dust in communities that already suffer disproportionately from public health and environmental hazards.  Through this lawsuit and consent decree, we are holding Apex responsible for its legal violations.” EPA Regional Administrator Lisa F. Garcia said: “This company’s actions were inexcusable; they are also all too common, that is why EPA is partnering with state and local partners to crack down on improper renovation work that can expose our kids to toxic lead.  There is no safe level of lead, and lead paint dust is the biggest source of lead exposure for children.  As evidenced by this case, if companies think they can get away with endangering our kids, they are wrong.” The TSCA and the RRP Rule impose safety requirements to minimize the risk that young children, tenants, and renovation workers are exposed to toxic lead paint dust during renovations of residential buildings.  Exposure to lead paint dust is the most common cause of lead poisoning, which can lead to severe, irreversible health problems, particularly in children.  Lead poisoning can affect children’s brains and developing nervous systems, causing reduced IQ, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. As alleged in the United States’ complaint filed in the district court: APEX is a general contractor that conducted renovation work in hundreds of apartment units between 2015 and 2021.  In March 2016, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene inspected an APEX worksite and found that it had failed to contain lead dust, resulting in dust containing lead-based paint in excess of federal standards entering public hallways, in violation of the RRP Rule.  The EPA determined that APEX also lacked required certifications, failed to train its workers on lead-safe work practices, and failed to inform the building owner and occupants of the risks of lead poisoning during that renovation.  When APEX was informed of these issues, it provided the EPA with inaccurate information about its RRP Rule compliance.  Rather than coming into full compliance with the law, APEX continued to violate the RRP Rule through at least 2021.  These alleged violations occurred at low-income residential properties, where tenants are already disproportionately burdened by other environmental hazards. In the Consent Decree, APEX admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: Failing to adequately contain construction dust, including dust containing lead in excess of levels permitted under the RRP Rule at one renovation project. Failing to assign a certified renovator to oversee the project, in violation of the RRP Rule at one renovation project. Failing to provide on-the-job lead safety training to workers, in violation of the RRP Rule at one renovation project. Failing to post signs clearly defining its work area and warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to remain outside of the work area, in violation of the RRP Rule at one renovation project. Failing to provide a lead-hazard information pamphlet to the owner or occupants of the building before commencing work, in violation of the RRP Rule at one renovation project. Failing to ensure that a certified renovator regularly directed work being performed at these projects and to provide on-the-job training for APEX’s other workers, in violation of the RRP Rule at three projects. Failing to maintain documentation showing that it provided lead-hazard information pamphlets to the owners or occupants of the buildings or that it had posted warning signs in the buildings, in violation of the RRP Rule at three projects. *                *                * Pursuant to the Consent Decree, APEX will pay a penalty of $606,706, an amount based on the company’s documented inability to pay the full civil penalty for which it otherwise would be liable.  Further, the Consent Decree requires APEX to comply with safe work practices and other RRP Rule requirements in the future and to conduct tenant and worker safety information sessions to mitigate potential harms it caused.  Failure to comply with the Consent Decree will give rise to significant additional penalties. To provide public notice and afford members of the public the opportunity to comment on the Consent Decree, the Consent Decree will be lodged with the District Court for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval. Mr. Williams thanked the attorneys and enforcement staff at EPA Region 2 for their critical work on this matter. This case is being handled by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mónica P. Folch and Zack Bannon are in charge of the case. U.S. v.

Leventis, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, and Naomi Gruchacz, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against THE CIGNA GROUP and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations (collectively, “CIGNA”).  The $37 million settlement resolves claims that CIGNA submitted to the Government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments CIGNA received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.  The lawsuit was originally filed by a whistleblower in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and later transferred to the Middle District of Tennessee. The Government’s Complaint alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by CIGNA to conduct in-home assessments of plan members.  The healthcare providers (typically nurse practitioners) who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported and were in many cases prohibited by CIGNA from providing any treatment during the home visits for the medical conditions they purportedly found.  The diagnoses at issue were not supported by the information documented on the forms completed by the vendors and were not reported to CIGNA by any other healthcare provider who saw the patient during the year in which the home visits occurred. Nevertheless, CIGNA submitted these diagnoses to the Government to claim increased payments and falsely certified each year that the diagnosis data it submitted was “accurate, complete, and truthful.” As part of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson, CIGNA will pay the United States a total of $37 million.  CIGNA also made extensive factual admissions in the settlement regarding the conduct alleged in the Government’s Complaint.  In connection with this settlement, CIGNA entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with HHS-OIG.  The CIA requires CIGNA to implement numerous accountability and auditing measures.  In particular, CIGNA must conduct annual risk assessments and other monitoring, and an independent review organization will conduct multi-faceted audits focused on risk adjustment data. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “For years, Cigna submitted to the Government false and invalid diagnosis information for its Medicare Advantage plan members.  The reported diagnoses of serious and complex conditions were based solely on cursory in-home assessments by providers who did not perform necessary diagnostic testing and imaging.  Cigna knew that these diagnoses would increase its Medicare Advantage payments by making its plan members appear sicker.  This Office is committed to holding insurers accountable if they seek to manipulate the Medicare Advantage Program and boost their profits by submitting false information to the Government.” U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Henry C. Leventis said: “Medicare Advantage relies on the integrity of its insurers and the accuracy of the diagnosis code information they provide, since it has an outsize effect on Medicare payments.  We will continue to vigorously pursue fraud in this increasingly important program.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz said: “Managed care plans’ primary responsibility is to ensure the health coordination and appropriate benefits for the beneficiaries they have enrolled, not focus on profits.  HHS-OIG will work with our partners at the U.S. Attorney’s Office to ensure the integrity of federal healthcare program funds and the provision of appropriate, quality services to patients.” Medicare Advantage, also known as the Medicare Part C program, provides health insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans who opt out of traditional Medicare.  Under Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”), typically operated by private insurers like CIGNA, provide coverage for Medicare Advantage plan members.  In return, MAOs receive monthly payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) that vary based on each member’s demographic information and medical diagnoses.  MAOs submit diagnoses for their plan members, usually provided by the plan members’ healthcare providers, to CMS.  CMS then uses those diagnoses, along with demographic factors, to calculate a “risk score” for each member and, in turn, the amount of the monthly payment it will pay the MAO for covering that member.  The Medicare Advantage payment model is intended to pay MAOs more to cover healthcare expenses for sicker plan members (who are expected to incur higher healthcare costs) and less for healthier plan members (who are expected to incur lower costs). As alleged in the Government’s Complaint: CIGNA, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, owns and operates numerous MAOs that administer Medicare Advantage Plans.  CIGNA contracted with several vendors to conduct home visits of Medicare Advantage plan members across the country as part of its broader so-called “360 comprehensive assessment” program.  The home visits were typically conducted by nurse practitioners and, on occasion, by other non-physician healthcare providers such as registered nurses and physician assistants (the “Vendor HCPs”).  Based on the visit, the Vendor HCPs completed a CIGNA-created form (“360 form”) that included a check-the-box multi-page list of a wide range of medical conditions.  CIGNA had its coding teams identify diagnosis codes that corresponded to the recorded medical conditions and then submitted those to CMS for risk adjustment payment purposes. CIGNA structured the 360 home visits for the primary purpose of capturing and recording lucrative diagnosis codes that would significantly increase the monthly capitated payments it received from CMS.  The purpose of the visits was not to treat patients’ medical conditions, and CIGNA explicitly prohibited the Vendor HCPs from providing actual patient treatment or care.  As CIGNA acknowledged in an internal document discussing the program, “[t]the primary goal of a 360 visit is administrative code capture and not chronic care or acute care management.”  But this was not disclosed to CIGNA’s plan members when the home visit was scheduled or during the actual visit.  When identifying plan members to receive home visits, CIGNA targeted individuals who were likely to yield the greatest risk score increases and thus the greatest increased payment. The Vendor HCPs spent limited time with the patients and did not conduct a comprehensive physical examination.  When completing the assessments and recording the diagnoses, the Vendor HCPs relied largely on the patient’s own self-assessment and their responses to various basic screening questions.  Vendor HCPs did not have access to the patient’s full medical history and typically did not obtain or review relevant records from the patient’s primary care physician in advance of the visit. CIGNA’s 360 home visit program regularly generated false and invalid diagnosis codes for certain serious, complex conditions that cannot be reliably diagnosed in a home setting and without extensive diagnostic testing or imaging.  In tens of thousands of instances, CIGNA submitted diagnosis codes that represent serious, complex medical conditions that (i) were based only on the home visits conducted by the Vendor HCPs; (ii) required specific testing or imaging to be reliably diagnosed, which was not performed; (iii) were not supported by the information documented on the 360 form completed by the Vendor HCPs; and (iv) were not reported by any other healthcare provider who saw the plan member during the year in which the home visit occurred (the “Invalid Diagnoses”).  The Invalid Diagnoses included, but are not limited to, diagnoses for complex medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes with renal complications.  According to CIGNA’s own clinical guidelines, accurately diagnosing these conditions requires specialized testing. CIGNA exerted pressure on Vendor HCPs to record high-value diagnoses that significantly increased risk adjustment payments.  CIGNA management identified at least 12 classes of generic chronic diagnoses that they thought were “often underdiagnosed” among its Plan members and, through trainings and seminars, encouraged the Vendor HCPs to make these diagnoses during the home visits.  CIGNA also closely tracked the volume and nature of the diagnoses generated by each vendor’s home visits, as well as how the diagnoses affected risk-adjusted payments.  CIGNA provided trainings to vendors to improve their “performance” when they failed to deliver the expected level of high-value diagnosis codes. The Invalid Diagnoses generated by the 360 home visits also did not conform with the International Classification of Diseases (“ICD”) Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting (the “ICD Guidelines”), as required by applicable federal regulations.  The Invalid Diagnoses did not affect patient care, treatment, or management during the home visit, as required under the ICD Guidelines, and thus were ineligible for risk adjustment.  In addition, the Invalid Diagnoses were not supported by the minimal information recorded on the 360 forms, in violation of the ICD Guidelines’ medical record documentation requirement.  In fact, in some cases, the 360 forms include clinical exam findings that contradict the supposed diagnosis.  For example, one patient received a congestive heart failure diagnosis from a home visit even though the 360 form explicitly noted that physical exam results found her heart to be “regular” and “normal,” and stated, “cardiac reviewed and unremarkable.” As part of the settlement, CIGNA admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government including the following: As part of the 360 Program, CIGNA contracted with vendors who employed nurse practitioners or other licensed healthcare providers to conduct assessments of Part C members in their homes.  The vendor healthcare providers, among other things, performed physical exams and documented diagnostic information on standardized forms provided or approved by CIGNA but in many cases were not permitted to provide treatment or prescriptions for medications. CIGNA’s medical coding team reviewed the completed “360” forms and, based on that review, identified diagnosis codes that corresponded to the medical conditions checked off on the forms, which were then submitted to CMS as part of CIGNA’s risk adjustment data.  The forms utilized by CIGNA’s vendors listed a wide range of diagnoses, including complex medical conditions. CIGNA tracked the volume and nature of the diagnoses generated by vendors’ home visits.  CIGNA also tracked how the diagnoses affected risk-adjusted payments. According to diagnostic criteria disseminated by CIGNA to the vendors, the clinical assessment of some of these diagnoses relies on laboratory evaluation, diagnostic imaging, or other diagnostic testing when making a particular diagnosis for the first time.  In many cases, CIGNA did not require 360 Program vendors conducting in-home assessments to have the equipment available to conduct such laboratory testing, imaging, or other diagnostic testing when diagnosing these conditions. In thousands of instances, the in-home assessments conducted by 360 Program vendors resulted in diagnoses of CIGNA members and the submission to CMS of resulting risk-adjusting diagnosis codes that had not been previously reported to CMS by CIGNA from any other encounter with a healthcare provider during the year in which the home visit occurred. Based on the in-home assessments of members completed by vendors pursuant to the 360 Program, in many instances, CIGNA reported to CMS diagnoses for Medicare Advantage Plan members where the 360 forms did not include clinical information that corroborated the diagnoses and did not reflect that the diagnostic testing necessary to make the diagnosis for the first time had been performed. In separate settlements announced today by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, CIGNA is also agreeing to resolve separate allegations that CIGNA submitted invalid beneficiary diagnoses to inflate Medicare Advantage payments that did not arise from CIGNA’s home visit program. *                *                * Mr. Williams thanked HHS-OIG and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee for their assistance with this case.

Leventis, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, and Naomi Gruchacz, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against THE CIGNA GROUP and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations (collectively, “CIGNA”).  The $37 million settlement resolves claims that CIGNA submitted to the Government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments CIGNA received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.  The lawsuit was originally filed by a whistleblower in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and later transferred to the Middle District of Tennessee. The Government’s Complaint alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by CIGNA to conduct in-home assessments of plan members.  The healthcare providers (typically nurse practitioners) who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported and were in many cases prohibited by CIGNA from providing any treatment during the home visits for the medical conditions they purportedly found.  The diagnoses at issue were not supported by the information documented on the forms completed by the vendors and were not reported to CIGNA by any other healthcare provider who saw the patient during the year in which the home visits occurred. Nevertheless, CIGNA submitted these diagnoses to the Government to claim increased payments and falsely certified each year that the diagnosis data it submitted was “accurate, complete, and truthful.” As part of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson, CIGNA will pay the United States a total of $37 million.  CIGNA also made extensive factual admissions in the settlement regarding the conduct alleged in the Government’s Complaint.  In connection with this settlement, CIGNA entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with HHS-OIG.  The CIA requires CIGNA to implement numerous accountability and auditing measures.  In particular, CIGNA must conduct annual risk assessments and other monitoring, and an independent review organization will conduct multi-faceted audits focused on risk adjustment data.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that partial summary judgment has been granted in favor of plaintiffs and the Government in a lawsuit brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by private plaintiffs ( Bronx Independent Living Services et al. v. MTA) in which the United States intervened.  U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (the “MTA”) replacement of the stairways at the Middletown Road subway station in the Bronx affected the station’s usability, thus triggering the MTA’s obligation under the ADA to install elevators, without regard to cost, unless it is technically infeasible to do so. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “The MTA is now on notice that whenever it renovates a subway station throughout its system so as to affect the station’s usability, the MTA is obligated to install an elevator, regardless of the cost, unless it is technically infeasible.  Individuals with disabilities have the same rights to use the New York City subway system as every other person.  The Court’s decision marks the end of the MTA treating people with disabilities as second-class citizens.  My Office will continue to work to ensure that the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act are enforced, and that everyone enjoys equal access to public transit in this District.” The ADA, signed into law in 1990, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public.  Under its provisions, the ADA requires state and local government agencies to make alterations to public transit facilities readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. In March 2018, this Office intervened in a private lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Advocates regarding the MTA’s refusal to install elevators at the Middletown Road station, despite undertaking a substantial renovation of the entire station, including the staircases.  The Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Authority (“FTA”), had declined the MTA’s request for federal funds for the renovation because the MTA’s refusal to install elevators violated the ADA. Judge Ramos ruled that MTA’s renovation of the Middletown Road station was an alteration that triggered the ADA’s requirement to install an elevator unless it is technically not feasible to do so.  Specifically, Judge Ramos concluded that when a public transit authority alters a station in a way that affects its “usability,” the public transit authority must follow the requirements in 49 C.F.R. § 37.43(a)(1), requiring the installation of an elevator where technically feasible regardless of cost.  The Court rejected the MTA’s argument that the governing regulation permitted it to avoid installing an elevator based on cost considerations. Mr. Berman thanked Disability Rights Advocates for its work in this case, as well as FTA for its continued assistance with this matter. This case is being handled by the Civil Rights Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ellen Blain and Lara Eshkenazi are in charge of the case.

For Violations Of Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Attorney For The United States Announces $9.5 Million Settlement With Stericycle, Inc. For Violations Of Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Press Release Attorney For The United States Announces $9.5 Million Settlement With Stericycle, Inc. For Violations Of Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Friday, January 17, 2025 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office,               Southern District of New York Matthew Podolsky, Attorney for the United States, Acting under Authority Conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 515, and Cecil Rodrigues, the Acting Assistant Administrator of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today that the U.S. has filed and simultaneously settled a lawsuit against STERICYCLE, INC. (“STERICYCLE”) for systemic, nationwide violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq. , and related regulations in the operation of its former hazardous waste management business from May 5, 2014, through April 6, 2020. The proposed stipulation and order of settlement agreed to by STERICYCLE requires payment of a $9.5 million civil penalty, one of the largest civil penalties ever paid for RCRA violations.  The settlement is subject to approval by the Court. Attorney for the United States Matthew Podolsky said: “Today, we hold Stericycle responsible for flouting hazardous waste management requirements while operating a nationwide hazardous waste business, and risking significant potential harm to human health and the environment.  This penalty should put other waste management firms on notice that we will hold them accountable when they shirk their legal responsibilities and put the public and environment in harm’s way.” EPA Acting Assistant Administrator Cecil Rodrigues said: “Stericycle repeatedly failed to ensure the proper transport, management, and storage of hazardous waste – a job that they were paid to do and entrusted to perform on behalf of customers nationwide.  EPA is committed to ensuring companies comply with the law and to protecting communities from the potential risks associated with the mismanagement of hazardous wastes.” As alleged in the U.S. Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: STERICYCLE is a waste management company that operated a nationwide hazardous waste transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal business until it sold the vast majority of the business on April 6, 2020.  STERICYCLE operated 13 RCRA-permitted hazardous waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (“TSDFs”) and 44 waste transfer facilities. Between May 5, 2014, and the date of sale, STERICYCLE routinely violated RCRA requirements related to tracking and transportation of hazardous waste, as alleged in detail in the Complaint.  STERICYCLE routinely lost track of hazardous waste while transporting it, sent hazardous waste to disposal facilities that were not the ones its customers had chosen, or delivered hazardous waste shipments without the required manifests. STERICYCLE also failed to comply with requirements for resolving and reporting discrepancies between hazardous waste identified on a shipping manifest and the hazardous waste received by STERICYCLE at its facilities for disposal, and it failed to timely return signed manifests to generators and timely submit them electronically to EPA.  STERICYCLE also violated RCRA by storing hazardous waste in transfer facilities when not authorized to do so, either because the storage period was longer than the 10 days permitted by RCRA regulations or because overall transportation times for the hazardous waste shipment exceeded those constituting “the normal course of transportation” under RCRA regulations.  All of this conduct violated RCRA hazardous waste regulations critical to preventing substantial risks to human health and the environment. STERICYCLE was well aware of severe problems giving rise to these violations and failed to address them.  In the words of one STERICYCLE director in 2016, STERICYCLE had “way too many issues with a basic fundamental of [its] business, getting waste and paperwork from the generator to the designated facility.”   In 2019, the same STERICYCLE director underscored the continuation of these fundamental failings:  “The most basic thing that we do for our clients is moving the waste from point a to point b and we can’t do it.” On April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE completed the sale of its “Stericycle Environmental Solutions” hazardous waste business and, since that date, has largely ceased managing hazardous waste in the U.S.  However, STERICYCLE remains accountable for its systemic RCRA violations prior to that sale. In the settlement filed with the federal court today, STERICYCLE admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following, among other things: On numerous occasions between May 5, 2014, and April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE was the transporter of hazardous waste shipments for hazardous waste generators, and failed to deliver part or all of the hazardous waste shipment described on the shipment’s manifest to the designated TSDF. On numerous occasions between May 5, 2014, and April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE (or one of its subsidiaries or subcontractors) served as a transporter of hazardous waste shipments to one of STERICYCLE’s TSDFs and failed to ensure that a manifest accompanied all hazardous waste shipments. On numerous occasions between May 5, 2014, and April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE failed to timely provide hazardous waste generators with final signed copies of their waste shipment manifests within 30 days after the shipments were delivered to STERICYCLE TSDFs. On numerous occasions between June 2018 and April 2020, STERICYCLE failed to timely submit hazardous waste manifests to EPA’s national system for electronically tracking hazardous waste shipments—known as the e-Manifest system—within 30 days after the date of delivery of the hazardous waste shipment to STERICYCLE TSDFs. On numerous occasions between May 5, 2014, and April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE failed to consult with a generator prior to changing the destination of hazardous waste as designated on a hazardous waste manifest. On numerous occasions between May 5, 2014, and April 6, 2020, STERICYCLE stored hazardous waste at its hazardous waste transfer facilities (as that term is defined in 40 C.F.R. § 260.10) for longer than the 10-day limits permitted under RCRA. *               *                * Mr. Podolsky thanked EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for its critical work on this case. The case is being handled by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Office’s Civil Division. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dominika Tarczynska and Tomoko Onozawa are in charge of the case.

The investigation will assess whether the SVD engages in a pattern or practice of gender-biased policing. The investigation will include a comprehensive review of the policies, procedures, and training for SVD investigations of sexual assault crimes, including how SVD interacts with survivors and witnesses, collects evidence, and completes investigations; any steps NYPD has taken to address deficiencies in its handling of sexual assault crimes; how SVD allocates staffing and other resources; and the services and support offered to survivors of sexual assault. As part of this investigation, the Justice Department officials will reach out to community groups and members of the public to learn about their experiences with SVD. Prior to the announcement, Justice Department (Department) officials notified Mayor Eric Adams, NYPD Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell, and NYC Corporation Counsel Sylvia O. Hinds-Radix, who have pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said:  “Survivors of sexual assault should expect effective, trauma-informed and victim-centered investigations by police departments.  Based on information provided to the Justice Department, we find significant justification to investigate whether the NYPD’s Special Victims Division engages in a pattern or practice of gender-biased policing. Investigations into sexual assault that comply with the Constitution promote accountability, enhance public safety and foster community trust.” SDNY U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “Victims of sex crimes deserve the same rigorous and unbiased investigations of their cases that the NYPD affords to other categories of crime.  Likewise, relentless and effective pursuit of perpetrators of sexual violence, unburdened by gender stereotypes or differential treatment, is essential to public safety. We look forward to working with our partners in EDNY and the Civil Rights Division to assess the NYPD’s practices in this area.” EDNY U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said:  “Respectful, thorough, and complete investigations of sexual assaults are fundamental to a well-functioning justice system.  Over the last several months, we have learned concerning information from a variety of sources of historical issues about the way the Special Victims Division has conducted its investigations for many years.  Our review is intended to ensure that, going forward, survivors of sexual assault in New York City receive fair and just treatment in the criminal justice system, and as a result, those who engage in sexual violence are held accountable.  We appreciate that the NYPD has already taken steps to address these concerns.” The Department received information alleging deficiencies at SVD that have persisted for more than a decade, depriving survivors and the public of the prompt, thorough, and effective investigations needed to protect public safety. These deficiencies allegedly include failing to conduct basic investigative steps and instead shaming and abusing survivors and re-traumatizing them during investigations. The investigation is being conducted pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law. The Act allows the Justice Department to remedy such misconduct through civil litigation. The Department will be assessing law enforcement practices under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Civil Rights Team in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Special Litigation Section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will jointly conduct this investigation.

For False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation On Two Federal Construction Projects Manhattan U.S. Attorney Settles Fraud Suit Against Tower Maintenance Corp. For False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation On Two Federal Construction Projects Press Release Manhattan U.S. Attorney Settles Fraud Suit Against Tower Maintenance Corp. For False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation On Two Federal Construction Projects Tuesday, August 17, 2021 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office,               Southern District of New York Audrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the United States has settled civil fraud claims against TOWER MAINTENANCE CORP. (“TOWER”), a Long Island-based steel painting company.  The settlement resolves the United States’ allegations that TOWER fraudulently obtained payments on two federally funded construction projects by causing misrepresentations of compliance with Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, which require participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  Specifically, the United States alleged that TOWER, a certified DBE, caused the prime contractors on the projects to misrepresent that TOWER, as a DBE, was solely performing work on the two projects, when in fact the work was managed and supervised by codefendant Spectrum Painting Corp. (“Spectrum”), a non-DBE. Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, TOWER admits and accepts responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s amended complaint and agrees to pay $150,000 to the United States.  The settlement amount is based on the Office’s assessment of TOWER’s ability to pay based on the financial information it provided.  The Office previously reached settlements to resolve its fraud claims against the codefendants in the lawsuit, Spectrum and Ahern Painting Contractors Co. (“Ahern”), under which Spectrum and Ahern were required to pay a total of $3.4 million. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “With this settlement, my Office paints a clear picture that we will pursue any contractor that participates in an unlawful scheme to exploit the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program.  All contractors are on notice that we are committed to rooting out public works contracting fraud.” As alleged in the amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in August 2019, TOWER performed steel painting work on two federally funded projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza.  Contracts for both projects required Ahern to hire DBEs to perform a percentage of the work and to adhere to the DBE regulations.  The DBE regulations require DBEs to manage and supervise their own work.  Yet TOWER hired Spectrum, a non-DBE painting subcontractor, to manage and supervise the DBE work that was supposed to be performed solely by TOWER.  Further, to conceal this scheme, TOWER passed off Spectrum employees as its own in project documents. As part of the settlement, TOWER admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct alleged in the amended complaint: In early 2010, TOWER knew that Ahern entered into an agreement with Skanska Koch Inc. (“Skanska”) for industrial painting and rehabilitation work on the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  TOWER understood that as a subcontractor on the Brooklyn Bridge Project, Ahern was obligated to meet or exceed Ahern’s DBE participation goal on the project.  TOWER also knew that Ahern expected to use TOWER, a certified DBE, to fulfill a substantial part of Ahern’s DBE participation goal for the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  In mid-2010, TOWER in fact entered into a subcontract with Ahern to perform painting and blasting work on the Brooklyn Bridge Project, which TOWER expected would be counted toward Ahern’s DBE participation goal for the project. In connection with the Brooklyn Bridge Project, TOWER signed and submitted to Ahern various documents stating that the DBE work subcontracted to TOWER would be performed by TOWER alone. In mid-2011, TOWER knew that Ahern entered into a contract with the MTA to provide overcoat painting on the elevated structure at the Queens Plaza subway station, and that Ahern was obligated to meet or exceed its DBE participation goal for the Queens Plaza Project.  TOWER also knew that Ahern was going to use TOWER as the DBE contractor on the Queens Plaza Project to meet Ahern’s DBE participation goal.  In 2011, TOWER entered into a subcontract with Ahern to perform painting and blasting work on the Queens Plaza Project, which TOWER expected would be counted toward Ahern’s DBE participation goal for that project. In May and June 2011, TOWER and Spectrum memorialized two “consulting agreements” for painting and blasting work on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects.  The key terms of the consulting agreements between TOWER and Spectrum – including TOWER’s agreement to pay Spectrum 50% of all of its profits from the two projects, Spectrum’s agreement to provide project management support, and Spectrum’s agreement to furnish equipment to TOWER for the projects – were not formally disclosed in writing to Ahern, nor were they disclosed in any way to Skanska, NYC-DOT, or MTA. Consistent with the consulting agreements, TOWER requested that Spectrum provide project management support for the DBE work that TOWER was retained to perform on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects. In addition to the Spectrum employee who assisted TOWER in preparing the bid TOWER submitted to Ahern for its anticipated work as a DBE subcontractor on the Brooklyn Bridge project (the “Spectrum Manager), Spectrum had two other employees providing project management support to TOWER for the DBE work subcontracted to TOWER on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects: a superintendent (the “Spectrum Superintendent”) and a health and safety supervisor (the “Spectrum Safety Supervisor”). In documents that TOWER submitted to Ahern in 2010, TOWER identified the Spectrum Manager as a “Tower VP” or as a TOWER employee working on the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  And in documents TOWER submitted to Ahern in 2011 in connection with the Queens Plaza Project, TOWER identified the Spectrum Manager as a “Director” of TOWER.  In addition, the Spectrum Manager, the Spectrum Superintendent, and the Spectrum Safety Supervisor identified themselves to others working on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects as TOWER employees. In addition to informing Ahern that Spectrum would perform work on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza projects, TOWER should have disclosed Spectrum’s work to the NYC-DOT and MTA DBE officers designated on the projects, and it should have sought clarification from Ahern regarding whether Ahern disclosed Spectrum’s involvement in accordance with Ahern’s obligations. TOWER should have proactively disclosed to the relevant DBE officer the details of its financial arrangement with Spectrum relative to the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, including that TOWER and Spectrum’s agreements relative to the projects included profit sharing and provisions for Spectrum to provide TOWER financing for TOWER’s performance of work on the projects. Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the United States Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, the New York City Department of Investigation, and the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mónica P. Folch and David J. Kennedy are in charge of this case.

Hegarty, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the U.S. Department of Defense - Office of Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), and Norbert E. Vint, Deputy Inspector General Performing the Duties of the Inspector General, Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (“OPM OIG”), announced today a $40.5 million settlement of a fraud lawsuit against Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. and its affiliate, Apria Healthcare LLC (together, “Apria”), a large durable medical equipment (“DME”) provider with approximately 300 branch offices located throughout the United States.  The lawsuit alleges, among other claims, that Apria submitted false claims to federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, seeking reimbursement for the rental of costly non-invasive ventilators (“NIVs”) to program beneficiaries who were not using the NIVs such that the devices were not medically necessary or that involved the improper waiver of patient co-insurance payments. Under the settlement, which was approved on December 18 by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, Apria agreed to pay a total sum of $40.5 million, with $37,632,789.89 being paid to the United States and the remaining amount to be paid to various states.  As part of the settlement, Apria also made extensive factual admissions regarding its conduct. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “It is critical to the financial integrity of federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid that reimbursements are made only for medically necessary items and services.  DME providers like Apria have an obligation to ensure that the equipment and devices they rent to patients are medically necessary.  When companies knowingly disregard that obligation to maximize their profits, this Office will hold them accountable for their fraudulent conduct.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “Apria’s conduct compromised the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and needlessly increased the financial burden on taxpayers.  Along with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to ensure that those individuals and entities that bill federal health care programs improperly are held accountable for their actions.” DCIS Special Agent in Charge Patrick J. Hegarty said:  “The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) is committed to protecting the integrity of TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families.  Charging TRICARE for DME that was not necessary betrays the public’s trust.  This settlement demonstrates our partnership with HHS-OIG, OPM-OIG and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to investigate fraudulent schemes that impact TRICARE and put its beneficiaries at risk.” OPM OIG Deputy Inspector General Norbert E. Vint said:  “The OPM OIG is committed to fighting all forms of health care fraud.  As demonstrated by this settlement, providers that exploit federal health care programs by submitting false claims will be held accountable.” As alleged in the complaint filed by the United States, Apria decided in 2014 to prioritize the expansion of its NIV rental business because health care programs like Medicare paid as much as $1,400 per month to cover NIVs, a type of complex respiratory equipment that can dynamically adjust the pressure level of air delivery.  That expansion, however, came at the cost of Apria’s compliance with the basic medical necessity requirement of federal health programs.  Specifically, while Apria knew that it was responsible for monitoring patients’ utilization of their NIVs and to stop billing when NIVs were no longer being used, it did not have enough staff, or “respiratory therapists,” to conduct such monitoring.  As a result, Apria routinely billed Medicare and other programs when it did not know whether NIVs were still being used by patients and, therefore, remained medically necessary.  Further, even when Apria had information indicating that patients were no longer using their NIVs, it often continued to bill the federal health programs. As further alleged, Apria engaged in two other types of improper practices to obtain more NIV orders and higher profits.  First, Apria improperly billed federal health programs for certain NIV rentals that were being used in a setting called PAC mode to provide bi-level pressure support therapy, which was available from a less expensive device called VPAP RAD and did not qualify for reimbursement at the NIV rate.  Second, Apria improperly waived co-pays for a number of Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries to induce them to rent NIVs.  For example, Apria employees offered to waive co-pays to convince patients to rent NIVs from Apria instead of competitors.  Further, Apria also waived co-pays without making the required individualized assessment of financial need.  As a result of those three widespread improper practices, Apria submitted thousands of false claims to federal health programs for NIV rentals and fraudulently received millions of dollars in reimbursements. As part of the settlement, Apria admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for, among others, the following conduct: NIV Continued Use Conduct Apria relied on the respiratory therapists (“RTs”) in its branches to monitor patients’ usage of their NIV devices.  Further, Apria’s NIV promotional materials indicated that Apria’s RTs would regularly visit NIV patients to assess whether they used their NIV devices in accordance with their physicians’ instructions. The RTs at Apria’s branches, however, often did not conduct regular visits to NIV patients to confirm that patients were using their NIVs as directed by their physicians. A January 2017 internal analysis, for example, found that in December 2016, Apria’s RTs failed to complete more than half of the visits to NIV patients mandated by Apria’s NIV clinical procedures at all three of Apria’s operational zones. Apria continued to seek payments from federal health programs for NIV rentals each month even though its RTs frequently failed to conduct in-home visits to verify that patients were still using their NIVs. In addition, when it had information from the RT visits indicating that patients had stopped using their NIVs, Apria often did not take steps to stop seeking payments from federal health programs or to determine if the NIV rentals were still medically necessary. PAC Mode Conduct In 2015, Apria encouraged its sales staff to actively urge physicians to order the Astral NIVs in PAC mode.  When they urged physicians to order the Astral NIVs in PAC mode, Apria’s salespeople frequently did not tell the physicians that PAC mode therapy was also available through the VPAP RAD at a lower monthly cost. On a number of occasions, this resulted in Apria renting the more expensive Astral NIVs to patients with the PAC mode therapy orders, including patients covered by federal health programs, even though the less expensive VPAP RADs may have met those patients’ medical needs. Co-Pay Waiver Conduct Managers at a number of Apria’s branches directed salespeople at those branches to routinely discuss the availability of co-pay waivers with NIV patients, including before the patients raised concerns about their ability to make these payments.  In a number of cases, those managers also authorized salespeople to offer co-pay waivers to persuade patients to rent NIVs from Apria instead of other DME suppliers. During the Covered Period, Apria gave full co-pay waivers to hundreds of NIV patients without making an assessment as to whether those patients could have afforded some portion of their co-pay responsibilities. *                      *                      * As a result of the admitted conduct, Apria received reimbursements from the federal health programs for some NIV rental claims that did not comply with all of those programs’ billing rules and guidance. In connection with this settlement, Apria also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with HHS-OIG, which requires Apria to implement board oversight, a claims review process by an Independent Review Organization, and other compliance steps designed to foster adherence to federal health care program requirements and thereby protect the programs. This settlement arises from a whistleblower case filed by three former Apria employees under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private persons – known as “relators” – to file civil cases on behalf of the United States and share in the recovery. Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss thanked the Washington State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for its extensive collaboration in the investigation and resolution of this case, and also praised the outstanding investigative work of the HHS-OIG, DCIS, and OPM-OIG. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Li Yu and Steven Kochevar and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Casey Lee have handled the case.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Police officers have tough jobs, and so many do their work honorably, lawfully, and with distinction, respecting the rights of the citizens they have sworn to protect.  But when officers break the law, they violate their oath and undermine a community’s trust.  We ask anyone who has information relevant to the investigation into the Mount Vernon Police Department to contact the Department of Justice via email at community.mvpd@usdoj.gov or to call (866) 985-1378.” Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Kristen Clarke said: “An effective and accountable police department is a hallmark of a healthy and well-functioning democracy.  The Civil Rights Division is committed to ensuring that law enforcement agencies across our country use their authority in a manner that is constitutional, transparent, and free from discrimination.” This morning, SDNY and Civil Rights Division officials informed Mount Vernon Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard, MVPD Chief Marcel Olifiers, City Council President Marcus A. Griffith, Commissioner of Public Safety Glenn Scott, and Corporation Counsel Brian Johnson of the investigation. The investigation is being conducted pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law.  The Act allows the Department of Justice to remedy such misconduct through civil litigation.  SDNY and the Civil Rights Division will be assessing law enforcement practices under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as under the Safe Streets Act of 1968 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division, in Washington, D.C., are jointly conducting this investigation.  Individuals with relevant information are encouraged to contact the Department of Justice via email at community.mvpd@usdoj.gov or by phone at (866) 985-1378.  Individuals can also report civil rights violations regarding this or other matters using the Civil Rights Division’s reporting portal, available at civilrights.justice.gov . Additional information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is available on its website at https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny .  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division and the Division’s Police Reform Work is available on its website at www.justice.gov/crt and at /media/872116/dl?inline .

The investigation is being conducted pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law.  The Act allows the Department of Justice to remedy such misconduct through civil litigation.  SDNY and the Civil Rights Division will be assessing law enforcement practices under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as under the Safe Streets Act of 1968 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division, in Washington, D.C., are jointly conducting this investigation.  Individuals with relevant information are encouraged to contact the Department of Justice via email at community.mvpd@usdoj.gov or by phone at (866) 985-1378.  Individuals can also report civil rights violations regarding this or other matters using the Civil Rights Division’s reporting portal, available at civilrights.justice.gov .

Driscoll, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Fernando P. McMillan, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration – Office of Criminal Investigations (“FDA-OIC”), announced today the filing of a two-count Indictment (the “Indictment”) charging Laura PERRYMAN, the former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of STIMWAVE LLC, a Florida-based medical device company, in connection with a scheme to create and sell a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.  PERRYMAN was arrested this morning in Delray Beach, Florida, and will be presented later today in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Mr. Williams announced the unsealing of a non-prosecution agreement (the “Agreement”) with STIMWAVE LLC ("STIMWAVE"), which filed for bankruptcy on June 15, 2022.  The Agreement was entered into on October 29, 2022, and was sealed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, pending the Government’s ongoing investigation.  Under the terms of the Agreement, STIMWAVE has accepted responsibility for its conduct by, among other things: (i) making admissions and stipulating to the accuracy of an extensive Statement of Facts; (ii) paying a $10,000,000 monetary penalty; and (iii) maintaining an adequate compliance program, to include employing a Chief Compliance Officer and holding regular compliance committee meetings.  STIMWAVE is also required to cooperate fully with the Government.  STIMWAVE’s obligations under the Agreement will continue for a period of three years from the date of execution of the Agreement. The U.S. Attorney’s Office also unsealed a civil fraud lawsuit filed against STIMWAVE under the False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the parties’ settlement of that suit (the “FCA Settlement”).  The settlement has been submitted to United States District Judge George B. Daniels for approval.  In connection with the FCA Settlement, STIMWAVE admitted and accepted responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s civil complaint and agreed to pay $8,600,000 to the United States.  This payment will be credited towards the $10,000,000 monetary penalty discussed above.  The civil complaint also brings claims against PERRYMAN under the FCA, which are pending. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, at the direction of its founder and CEO Laura Perryman, Stimwave created a dummy medical device component — made entirely of plastic — designed to be implanted in patients for the sole purpose of causing doctors to unwittingly bill Medicare and private insurance companies more than $16,000 for each implantation of the piece of plastic.  The defendant and Stimwave did this so that they could charge medical providers many thousands of dollars for purchasing their medical device.  Our Office will continue to do everything in its power to bring to justice anyone responsible for perpetuating health care fraud, which in this case led to patients being used as nothing more than tools for financial enrichment.” FBI Assistant Director Michael J. Driscoll said: “Ms. Perryman, as the Chief Executive Officer of Stimwave, allegedly led a scheme to sell medical devices that contained a non-functioning component that doctors unwittingly implanted into patients suffering from chronic pain.  As a result of her illegal actions, not only did patients undergo unnecessary implanting procedures, but Medicare was defrauded of millions of dollars.  Today’s action demonstrates the FBI’s continuing commitment to protect Medicare and other government programs from financial fraud and abuse.” FDA-OIC Special Agent in Charge Fernando P. McMillan said: “Individuals and companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices with non-functional components put the health of patients at significant risk.  We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who jeopardize the health of their patients and of the public.” According to the documents unsealed today in Manhattan federal court and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware: [1] STIMWAVE was a medical device company that manufactured and distributed implantable neurostimulation devices designed to treat intractable, chronic pain.  Founded in 2010 by PERRYMAN and others, STIMWAVE was headquartered in Pompano Beach, Florida. STIMWAVE was founded on the premise that its products would provide non-opioid alternatives to chronic pain management.  As the founder and CEO of STIMWAVE, PERRYMAN oversaw the design of the StimQ PNS System (the “Device”), a neurostimulator medical device that treated chronic pain by producing electrical currents to target peripheral nerves outside the spinal cord.  From at least in or about 2017 up to and including her termination in or about 2019, PERRYMAN, as STIMWAVE’s CEO, engaged in a multi-year scheme (the “Scheme”) to design, create, manufacture, and market an inert, non-functioning component of the Device — called the “White Stylet” — that served no medical purpose but was included with the Device through in or about 2020 in order to make the product financially viable for doctors to purchase. When STIMWAVE originally brought the Device to market in or about 2017, it contained three primary components: (i) an implantable electrode array (the “Lead”) that stimulated the nerve; (ii) an externally worn battery that sat outside the body and wirelessly provided power to the Lead through the patient’s skin (the “Battery”); and (iii) a separate implantable receiver measuring approximately 23 centimeters in length with a distinctive pink handle — called the “Pink Stylet.”  The Pink Stylet contained copper and, unlike the White Stylet, functioned as a receiver to transmit energy from the Battery to the Lead. STIMWAVE sold the Device to doctors and medical providers for over approximately $16,000.  Medical insurance providers, including Medicare, would reimburse medical practitioners for implanting the Device into patients through two separate reimbursement codes, one for implantation of the Lead and a second for implantation of the Pink Stylet.  The billing code for implanting the Lead provided for reimbursement at a rate of between approximately $4,000 and $6,000, while the billing code for implanting a receiver, like the Pink Stylet, provided for reimbursement at a rate of between approximately $16,000 and $18,000. Soon after the Device was released, physicians informed STIMWAVE that they were having trouble implanting the Pink Stylet in certain patients because the Pink Stylet was too long.  STIMWAVE and PERRYMAN knew that the Pink Stylet could not be cut or trimmed to shorten it without interfering with the functionality of the Pink Stylet as a receiver, and without a receiver component for doctors to implant and seek reimbursement for, doctors would incur a substantial financial loss with every purchase of the Device, thereby making it more difficult for STIMWAVE to sell the Device to doctors and medical providers at the approximately $16,000 price. However, STIMWAVE — at the direction of PERRYMAN — did not lower the price of the Device so that its cost to doctors and medical providers could be covered by reimbursement for the implantation of only the Lead, nor did PERRYMAN recommend that doctors not implant the Device or its receiver component in cases where the Pink Stylet could not fit comfortably.  Instead, PERRYMAN directed that STIMWAVE create the White Stylet — a dummy component made entirely of plastic that served no medical purpose but which STIMWAVE misrepresented to doctors as a customizable receiver alternative to the Pink Stylet.  The White Stylet could be cut to size by the doctor for use in smaller anatomical spaces and was created solely so that doctors and medical providers would continue to purchase the Device for use in those scenarios and continue to bill for the implantation of a receiver component.  To perpetuate the lie that the White Stylet was functional, PERRYMAN oversaw training that suggested to doctors that the White Stylet was a “receiver,” when, in fact, it was made entirely of plastic, contained no copper, and therefore had no conductivity.  In addition, PERRYMAN directed other STIMWAVE employees to vouch for the efficacy of the White Stylet, when she knew that the White Stylet was actually non-functional. As a result of these misrepresentations regarding the functionality of the White Stylet, PERRYMAN caused doctors and medical providers to unwittingly implant the non-functional White Stylet into patients and submit fraudulent reimbursement claims for implantation of the White Stylet to Medicare, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to the federal government. On June 15, 2022, STIMWAVE filed for bankruptcy in Delaware under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, through which it sold substantially all of its assets to a third-party through an auction. *                *                * PERRYMAN, 54, of Delray Beach, Florida, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of health care fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge. Mr. Williams praised the investigative work of the FBI and thanked the FDA for its assistance. The criminal case is being handled by the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit of the Office’s Criminal Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Louis A. Pellegrino, Jacob M. Bergman, and Mónica P. Folch are in charge of the prosecution.  The civil case against STIMWAVE and PERRYMAN is being handled by the Civil Frauds Unit of the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacob M. Bergman and Mónica P. Folch are in charge of the civil case. The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. [1] As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment constitutes only allegations, and every fact described herein should be treated as an allegation.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Douglas Shoemaker, regional Special Agent-in-Charge of the United States Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General (“USDOT-OIG”), Margaret Garnett, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation (“DOI”), and Carolyn Pokorny, Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA-OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled civil fraud claims against New York-area painting contractor AHERN PAINTING CONTRACTORS CO. (“AHERN”).  The settlement resolves the United States’ allegations in a False Claims Act lawsuit that AHERN fraudulently obtained payments on two federally funded construction projects by misrepresenting compliance with Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) rules, which require participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.  Specifically, the United States alleged that AHERN misrepresented that co-defendant TOWER MAINTENANCE CORP. (“TOWER”), a certified DBE, was solely performing millions of dollars of work on the two projects when in fact much of that work was performed by co-defendant SPECTRUM PAINTING CORP. (“SPECTRUM”), a non-DBE.  As part of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts, AHERN admits and accepts responsibility for conduct alleged in the Government’s complaint and agrees to pay $3 million to the United States.  The case against defendants TOWER and SPECTRUM is ongoing. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Contractors who exploit the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program to unlawfully obtain millions of dollars in federal funding will be held to account.  Today’s settlement reflects this Office’s commitment to root out fraud in federally funded contracts, so that legitimate minority- and women-owned businesses can participate in public construction projects.” USDOT-OIG regional Special Agent-in-Charge Douglas Shoemaker said:  “Today’s settlement is a positive step on the way to closing the chapter on this egregious fraud scheme involving federally funded contracts administered through the New York City Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  While the damage to the integrity of DOT’s DBE program in this instance has been done, it only serves to strengthen our resolve in pursuing those whose greed prevents the legitimate participation of disadvantaged businesses in federal contracting on public transportation projects.” DOI Commissioner Margaret Garnett said:  “Today’s multimillion-dollar settlement demonstrates that law enforcement has its sights on exposing fraud by companies that exploit City and Federal programs aimed at increasing the participation of disadvantaged businesses in public construction projects.  DOI and its partners will continue to protect the integrity and effectiveness of these programs with investigations that uncover and deter dishonest conduct.” MTA Inspector General Carolyn Pokorny said:  “Disadvantaged Business Enterprise regulations enable honest competition in construction contracts by ensuring an equal and inclusive playing field for all.  Today’s DBE fraud settlement highlights the commitment of the Office of the MTA Inspector General, along with all of our prosecutorial and investigative partners, towards prohibiting and rooting out discrimination.” As alleged in the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court on March 2, 2019, AHERN was a contractor on two federally funded steel painting projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza.  Contracts for both projects required AHERN to hire DBEs to do a percentage of the work involved and adhere to the DBE regulations.  Instead of hiring qualified DBEs to perform the allotted DBE work, AHERN allowed SPECTRUM and TOWER to use TOWER’s status as a DBE to take credit for millions of dollars of work performed, managed, and supervised by non-DBE SPECTRUM.  To conceal this scheme, SPECTRUM employees repeatedly identified themselves as TOWER employees in documents that AHERN passed along to supervisors on the project.  AHERN and TOWER repeatedly submitted false statements and records to NYC-DOT and MTA misrepresenting that TOWER alone did all of the work allocated to DBEs and that TOWER did not hire a subcontractor to perform any of that work. As part of the settlement, AHERN admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for conduct alleged in the complaint as described below: Over the course of the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza projects, AHERN was aware of the following facts regarding the involvement of SPECTRUM, a non-DBE, in the projects: In March 2010, AHERN’s superintendent met with a TOWER manager and a SPECTRUM manager to do a walk-through of the Brooklyn Bridge worksite.  AHERN’s superintendent understood that the SPECTRUM manager would assist TOWER in preparing the bid TOWER submitted for its work as a DBE subcontractor on the Brooklyn Bridge Project; In documents that AHERN received from TOWER and then submitted to Skanska in 2010, TOWER identified the individual who AHERN knew to be a SPECTRUM manager as a “TOWER VP” or as a TOWER employee working on the Brooklyn Bridge Project.  In documents AHERN received from TOWER and then submitted to the MTA in 2011, TOWER identified the individual AHERN knew to be a SPECTRUM manager as TOWER’s superintendent for the Queens Plaza Project; Throughout the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, AHERN managers communicated directly with the SPECTRUM manager regarding the management and supervision of the projects, including scheduling and inspecting TOWER’s DBE work, ordering materials for TOWER’s DBE work, and payment for TOWER’s DBE work.  An AHERN executive also communicated directly with SPECTRUM’s owner regarding the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects. AHERN recklessly disregarded facts showing that SPECTRUM managed and supervised TOWER’s DBE work on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects. AHERN failed to seek clarification regarding the financial and other arrangements between TOWER and SPECTRUM or request a copy of any contract or agreement between TOWER and SPECTRUM regarding SPECTRUM’s role.  If AHERN had done so, and TOWER had responded truthfully, AHERN would have learned that TOWER and SPECTRUM had entered into written agreements specifying that SPECTRUM would provide project management support and furnish equipment on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, that TOWER and SPECTRUM would split any profits from the TOWER DBE work on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza Projects, and that in addition to the SPECTRUM manager, two other individuals AHERN believed to be TOWER managers were in fact employed by SPECTRUM. AHERN failed to assess whether SPECTRUM’s actual involvement in the projects was substantial enough to jeopardize TOWER’s standing as a DBE performing a “commercially useful function” under the applicable DBE regulations. Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the USDOT-OIG, DOI, and MTA-OIG. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mónica P. Folch, Li Yu, and David J. Kennedy are in charge of this case.

(“Meta”), formerly known as Facebook, Inc., requiring Meta to change its ad delivery system to prevent discriminatory advertising in violation of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”).  As required by the settlement entered on June 27, 2022, resolving a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Meta has now built a new system to address algorithmic discrimination.  Today, the parties informed the Court that they have reached agreement on the system’s compliance targets.  This development ensures that Meta will be subject to court oversight and regular review of its compliance with the settlement through June 27, 2026. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “This groundbreaking resolution sets a new standard for addressing discrimination through machine learning.  We appreciate that Meta agreed to work with us toward a resolution of this matter and applaud Meta for taking the first steps towards addressing algorithmic bias.  We hope that other companies will follow Meta’s lead in addressing discrimination in their advertising platforms.  We will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to address violations of the Fair Housing Act.” “This development marks a pivotal step in the Justice Department’s efforts to hold Meta accountable for unlawful algorithmic bias and discriminatory ad delivery on its platforms,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to hold Meta accountable by ensuring the Variance Reduction System addresses and eliminates discriminatory delivery of advertisements on its platforms.  Federal monitoring of Meta should send a strong signal to other tech companies that they too will be held accountable for failing to address algorithmic discrimination that runs afoul of our civil rights laws.” The United States’ complaint alleged, among other things, that Meta uses algorithms in determining which Meta users receive ads, including housing ads, and that those algorithms rely, in part, on characteristics protected under the FHA.  Specifically, the United States alleged that Meta feeds troves of user information into its ad delivery system, including information related to users’ FHA-protected characteristics such as sex and race, and uses that information in its personalization algorithms to predict which ad is most relevant to which user.  As the complaint alleged, Meta’s delivery algorithms introduce bias when delivering ads, resulting in a variance along sex and estimated race/ethnicity between the set of users who are eligible to see housing ads based on the advertiser’s targeted audience and the set of users who actually see the ad. Pursuant to the settlement, Meta has developed a new system—the Variance Reduction System (“VRS”)—to reduce the variances between the eligible audience and the actual audience.  The United States has concluded that the new system will substantially reduce the variances between the eligible and actual audiences along sex and estimated race/ethnicity in the delivery of housing advertisements.  The VRS will operate on all housing advertisements across Meta platforms, and the agreement requires Meta to meet certain compliance metrics in stages.  For example, by December 31, 2023, for the vast majority of housing ads on Meta platforms, Meta will reduce variances to less than or equal to 10% for 91.7% of those ads for sex and less than or equal to 10% for 81.0% of those ads for estimated race/ethnicity.  For more information on the operation of the VRS, read Meta’s technical paper . As further provided in the settlement agreement, the parties have selected an independent, third-party reviewer, Guidehouse, Inc. (“Guidehouse”), to investigate and verify on an ongoing basis whether the VRS is meeting the compliance metrics agreed to by the parties.  Under the agreement, Meta must provide Guidehouse and the United States with regular compliance reports and make available any information necessary to verify compliance with the agreed-upon metrics.  The court will have ultimate authority to resolve any disputes over the information that Meta must provide. Finally, as also required by the settlement agreement, Meta has ceased delivering housing advertisements using the Special Ad Audience tool (which delivered ads to users who “look like” other users), and Meta will not provide any targeting options for housing advertisers that directly describe or relate to FHA-protected characteristics. This agreement marks the first time that Meta will be subject to court oversight for its ad targeting and delivery system.

The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ellen Blain, David J. Kennedy, and Christine S. Poscablo are in charge of the case.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), announced today criminal charges against Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc. (“RDC”), one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States; Laurence F. Doud III, the company’s former chief executive officer; and William Pietruszewski, the company’s former chief compliance officer, for unlawfully distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA.  Mr. Berman’s Office also filed a lawsuit against RDC for its knowing failure to comply with its legal obligation to report thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA. Mr. Berman also announced an agreement (the “Agreement”) and consent decree under which RDC agreed to accept responsibility for its conduct by making admissions and stipulating to the accuracy of an extensive Statement of Facts, pay a $20 million penalty, reform and enhance its Controlled Substances Act compliance program, and submit to supervision by an independent monitor.  Assuming RDC’s continued compliance with the Agreement, the Government has agreed to defer prosecution for a period of five years, after which time the Government will seek to dismiss the charges.  The consent decree is subject to final approval by the court. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “This prosecution is the first of its kind:  executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country.  Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms.” DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said:  “Today’s charges should send shock waves throughout the pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication.  The distribution of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members of the pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in America.  DEA investigates DEA Registrants who divert controlled pharmaceutical medication into the wrong hands for the wrong reason.  This historic investigation unveiled a criminal element of denial in RDC’s compliance practices, and holds them accountable for their egregious non-compliance according to the law.” According to the documents filed today in Manhattan federal court [1] : Violations of the Federal Narcotics Laws From 2012 through March 2017, as alleged, RDC knowingly and intentionally violated the federal narcotics laws by distributing dangerous, highly addictive opioids to pharmacy customers that it knew were being sold and used illicitly.  At the direction of its senior management, including Doud and Pietruszewski, RDC supplied large quantities of oxycodone, fentanyl, and other dangerous opioids to pharmacy customers that its own compliance personnel determined were dispensing those drugs to individuals who had no legitimate medical need for them.  RDC distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies even after identifying “red flags” of diversion, including dispensing highly abused controlled substances in large quantities; dispensing primarily controlled substances; dispensing quantities of controlled substances in amounts consistently higher than accepted medical standards; accepting a high percentage of cash for controlled substance prescriptions; dispensing to out-of-state patients; and filling controlled substances prescriptions issued by practitioners acting outside the scope of their medical practice, under investigation by law enforcement, or on RDC’s “watch list.”  In addition, and at Doud’s direction, RDC frequently brought on pharmacy customers that had been terminated by other distributors. RDC’s employees, including in conversations with Doud and Pietruszewski, described some of the company’s customers as “very suspicious,” and even characterized particular pharmacies as a “DEA investigation in the making” or “like a stick of dynamite waiting for [the] DEA to light the fuse.”  Nonetheless, throughout the period in question, RDC, at the direction of Doud, increased its sales of oxycodone and fentanyl exponentially.  From 2012 to 2016, RDC’s sales of oxycodone tablets grew from 4.7 million to 42.2 million – an increase of approximately 800 percent – and during the same period RDC’s fentanyl sales grew from approximately 63,000 dosages in 2012 to over 1.3 million in 2016 – an increase of approximately 2,000 percent.  During that same time period, Doud’s compensation increased by over 125 percent, growing to over $1.5 million in 2016. Conspiracy to Defraud the DEA From 2012 through March 2017, as alleged, RDC took steps to conceal its illicit distribution of controlled substances from the DEA and other law enforcement authorities.  Among other things, RDC made the deliberate decision not to investigate, monitor, or report to the DEA pharmacy customers that it knew were diverting controlled substances for illegitimate use.  Because it knew that reporting these pharmacies would likely result in the DEA investigating and shutting down its customers, RDC’s senior management, including Doud, directed the company’s compliance department – and in particular Pietruszewski – not to report them, and instead to continue supplying those customers with dangerous controlled substances that the company knew were being dispensed and used for illicit purposes.  Among other things, pursuant to Doud’s instructions, and contrary to the company’s representations to the DEA, RDC opened new customer accounts without conducting due diligence, and supplied those customers – some of whom had been terminated by other distributors – with dangerous controlled substances. Additionally, RDC knowingly and willfully avoided filing suspicious order reports with the DEA as required by law.  Between 2012 through 2016, the company identified approximately 8,300 potentially suspicious “orders of interest,” including thousands of oxycodone orders, but the company reported only four suspicious orders to the DEA.  As alleged, RDC did not report suspicious orders in order to protect the profit being generated by customers dispensing large quantities of controlled substances.  As a result, the DEA’s ability to identify and prevent the illicit dispensing of highly addictive controlled substances by several of RDC’s pharmacy customers was impeded. *                      *                     * ROCHESTER DRUG CO-OPERATIVE, INC., is a wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products, including controlled substances, headquartered in Rochester, New York.  It is one of the nation’s 10 largest distributors of pharmaceutical products – and the fourth largest in the New York area – with over 1,300 pharmacy customers and over $1 billion in revenue per year.  RDC has been charged in an Information with conspiracy to violate the narcotics laws, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and willfully failing to file suspicious order reports.  RDC has also been sued in a civil complaint for its failure to file suspicious order reports. LAURENCE F. DOUD III, 75, of New Smyrna, Florida, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum prison term of five years. WILLIAM PIETRUSZEWSKI, 53, of Oak Ridge, New Jersey, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum prison term of 10 years; one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and one count of willfully failing to file suspicious order reports with the DEA, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison.  PIETRUSZEWSKI pled guilty to these charges, pursuant to a cooperation agreement, on April 19, 2019. The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge. Mr. Berman praised the investigative work of the DEA’s Westchester Tactical Diversion Team, comprising Special Agents, Diversion Investigators, and Task Force Officers from the DEA, Westchester County Police Department, Town of Orangetown Police Department, Rockland County Sheriff’s Office, Woodbury Police Department, Yonkers Police Department, New Windsor Police Department, and Putnam County Sheriff’s Office. The criminal cases are being handled by the Narcotics Unit of the Office’s Criminal Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephanie Lake, Louis Pellegrino, Nicolas Roos, and Alexandra Rothman are in charge of the prosecutions.  The civil case against RDC is being handled by the Office’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacob M. Bergman and Jeffrey K. Powell are in charge of the case. The charges contained in the Doud Indictment and RDC Information are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. [1] As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment against Doud and the description of the Indictment set forth below constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Gregory E. Demske, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS-OIG”), Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge of HHS-OIG’s New York Regional Office, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”) Northeast Field Office, Michael C. Mikulka, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (“DOL-OIG”), Matthew Modafferi, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Area Field Office (“USPS-OIG”), and Thomas W. South, Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Office of the Inspector General (“OPM-OIG”), announced today that the United States filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national pharmacy chain WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. (“WALGREENS”), pursuant to which WALGREENS must pay the United States and state governments a total of $269.2 million.  The first settlement, approved on January 16, 2019, by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty and unsealed today, requires WALGREENS to pay $209.2 million to resolve allegations that it improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs for hundreds of thousands of insulin pens it knowingly dispensed to program beneficiaries who did not need them.  The second settlement, approved on January 15, 2019, by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken and unsealed today, requires WALGREENS to pay $60 million to resolve allegations that it overbilled Medicaid by failing to disclose to and charge Medicaid the lower drug prices that WALGREENS offered the public through a discount program.  In both settlements, WALGREENS admitted and accepted responsibility for conduct the Government alleged in its complaints under the False Claims Act. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Medicare and Medicaid provide essential healthcare coverage to millions of people across this country.  The financial integrity of these programs depends on truthful and accurate billing by pharmacies like Walgreens.  Overbilling and improper billing of Medicare and Medicaid unduly burden taxpayers and put the solvency of these vital healthcare programs at risk.  This Office will hold healthcare providers to account when they fail to deal honestly with federal programs.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “Walgreens engaged in practices that undermined the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, compromised patient care, and wasted taxpayer dollars.  Along with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to protect the individuals that depend on federally funded health care programs, and ensure that companies that do business with those programs do so in an honest fashion.” DCIS Special Agent-in-Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey said:  “Health care fraud impacting the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is a top investigative priority for the DCIS.  The settlements announced today by the U.S. Attorney’s Office are the direct result of a joint investigative effort by the DCIS, the FBI, HHS OIG, DoL OIG, OPM OIG, Postal OIG, and the U.S. Department of Justice.  The successful resolution of these cases demonstrates the DCIS’s ongoing commitment to work with its law enforcement partners to combat health care fraud, protect Defense Health Agency funds, and ensure the integrity of TRICARE, the DoD’s health care system.” DOL-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Michael C. Mikulka said:  “Walgreens defrauded the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Program and other health care programs out of millions of dollars by over-dispensing insulin pens at the risk of potentially causing harm to beneficiaries.  We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of DOL’s benefit programs.” USPS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Matthew Modafferi said:  “This settlement sends a clear message to pharmaceutical chains to follow the law.  Pharmacies that attempt to take advantage of federal benefit systems will be pursued by the Special Agents of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General, their law enforcement partners, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.” OPM-OIG Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Thomas W. South said:   “The OPM-OIG has zero tolerance for fraud against the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  Today’s settlement reflects our commitment to pursuing and preventing improper and illegal billing practices that waste taxpayer dollars and increase the cost of medical care.  I would like to thank the DOJ attorneys, OPM-OIG agents, and their law enforcement partners for all their hard work.” Insulin Pens Settlement The United States’ complaint alleges that WALGREENS routinely submitted false days-of-supply data to federal healthcare programs when it sought federal reimbursement for insulin pens it dispensed to federal beneficiaries who did not need them.  Specifically, WALGREENS engaged in two practices that resulted in the fraudulent submissions.  First, WALGREENS configured its electronic pharmacy management system to prevent its pharmacists from dispensing less than a full box of five insulin pens, even when patients did not need that much insulin.  Second, when a full box of insulin pens exceeded the federal healthcare program’s limit on the total days of supply ( i.e. , the total number of daily doses) that could be dispensed and reimbursed at that time, WALGREENS evaded this restriction by falsely stating in its reimbursement claims that the total days of supply did not go over the limit.  As a result, federal healthcare programs paid WALGREENS millions of dollars for insulin that many beneficiaries did not actually need, and substantial quantities of valuable medication were wasted.  This conduct also opened the door to potential healthcare risks and abuse, such as the improper resale of insulin pens on the Internet. The settlement requires WALGREENS to pay approximately $168 million to the United States, and WALGREENS has agreed separately to pay approximately $41.2 million to state governments. [1] Under the settlement, WALGREENS admitted, among other things, that: When a federal health program denied a claim from WALGREENS because the reported days of supply for a full carton of five insulin pens exceeded the federal program’s days-of-supply limit, it was WALGREENS’s  practice to dispense and bill for the full carton and reduce the reported days of supply to conform to the program’s days-of-supply limit; and WALGREENS thus repeatedly reported days-of-supply data to federal health programs that were different from, and lower than, the days-of-supply calculated according to the standard pharmacy billing formula. Discount Drug Pricing Settlement The United States’ complaint in this case alleges that WALGREENS operated a program called the Prescription Savings Club (the “PSC”), under which customers received discounts when they ordered drugs from WALGREENS.  Medicaid regulations directed WALGREENS to seek Medicaid reimbursement only at the lowest of certain drug price points, including the “usual and customary price” (“U&C price”).  Medicaid rules of many states defined the U&C price as the price offered through discount programs like the PSC.  Contrary to these requirements, WALGREENS did not disclose to Medicaid the discount drug prices it offered customers through the PSC when it sought reimbursement from Medicaid.  As a result, Medicaid programs paid WALGREENS more in reimbursements than they would have paid had WALGREENS disclosed the lower PSC prices. The settlement requires WALGREENS to pay a total of $60 million, of which approximately $32 million is to the United States and approximately $28 million will go to state governments.  Under the settlement, WALGREENS admitted, among other things, that: Customers who enrolled in the PSC were eligible to receive discounts for thousands of types of drugs, and WALGREENS offered a savings guarantee under which PSC enrollees could recoup through a store credit the difference between the amount they paid to enroll in a given year and the amount they received in discounted savings in that year; and In submitting claims for reimbursement to Medicaid, WALGREENS did not identify its PSC program prices as its U&C prices for the drugs on the PSC program formulary, which resulted in the States paying more in reimbursement than they would have paid if WALGREENS had identified its PSC program prices. Both cases arose from lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act. In connection with these settlements, WALGREENS has entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with HHS-OIG.  The Corporate Integrity Agreement reaches broadly across WALGREENS’s retail and specialty pharmacies that bill federal health care programs.  Board oversight, multi-site claims reviews to be conducted by an Independent Review Organization, and other Corporate Integrity Agreement requirements seek to foster adherence to federal health care program requirements and thereby protect the programs. Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the HHS-OIG, FBI, DOD-OIG, DOL-OIG, USPS-OIG, and OPM-OIG.  He also thanked the Medicaid Fraud Control Units for Indiana, Washington, New York, and Texas for their assistance in these cases. These cases are being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Li Yu and Jessica Jean Hu are in charge of the insulin pens case against Walgreens, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Harwood was in charge of the discount drug pricing case against Walgreens. [1] The Medicaid program is primarily administered by the states but financed jointly by federal and state funds.

(“GRAMERCY CARDIAC”) for paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to physicians and their practices for patient referrals.  The kickbacks took the form of inflated office “rental payments” and fees paid to contracted cardiologists.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, from 2010 to 2021, RENTROP and Gramercy Cardiac entered into office space rental agreements, often in excess of fair market value, with primary care and other physicians (or their medical practices) in order to induce these physicians to refer patients to GRAMERCY CARDIAC-contracted cardiologists who saw patients at the rented office space.  These cardiologists then regularly ordered diagnostic tests and procedures that were performed at GRAMERCY CARDIAC locations and were paid a flat fee for each referral.  GRAMERCY CARDIAC provides cardiac diagnostic imaging services, including PET and SPECT scans, and previously operated four offices in New York City.  RENTROP founded and owns GRAMERCY CARDIAC and serves as its President. Under the settlement approved today by U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC will pay $4,510,678 to the United States and have admitted and accepted responsibility for conduct alleged in the Complaint as further described below.  RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC have also agreed to pay $1,989,362 to the State of New York to resolve the State’s claims, for a total recovery of $6.5 million.  The settlement amount is based on the Office’s assessment of RENTROP’s and GRAMERCY CARDIAC’s ability to pay based on the financial information they provided.  The parties have also executed a Consent Judgment in the amount of $64,416,515, which may be enforced if Defendants do not make the payments required under the settlement agreement.  In addition, RENTROP has agreed to relinquish his ownership and control over GRAMERCY CARDIAC by the end of the calendar year and will pay a portion of the proceeds of any sale of the practice to the United States.  Further, RENTROP is indefinitely barred from working for any entity that bills federal healthcare programs.  He also entered into a Voluntary Exclusion Agreement with HHS-OIG, which prohibits him from, among other things, participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs for five years. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Over more than a decade, Klaus Peter Rentrop and Gramercy Cardiac paid millions of dollars to doctors and their medical practices in exchange for patient referrals for cardiac testing and procedures.  The Anti-Kickback Statute is meant to ensure that when making medical decisions, a doctor considers only the patient’s best interests — not the doctor’s or others’ financial interests.  The defendants violated those doctor-patient relationships through their kickback arrangements, and now they are being held to account.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz said: “Individuals and entities that participate in the federal healthcare system are required to obey the laws meant to preserve the integrity of program funds and the provision of appropriate, quality services to patients.  Certain violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can induce medically unnecessary testing and influence physicians’ decision-making inappropriately.” According to the Complaint, from 2010 through 2021: RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC offered and paid physicians and their practices millions of dollars in kickbacks in the form of inflated “rental payments” and referral fees to induce them to refer patients to Gramercy-contracted cardiologists and to Gramercy Cardiac for diagnostic tests and procedures, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC’s scheme worked as follows.  RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC entered into office space rental agreements, often in excess of fair market value, with primary care and other physicians or their medical practices (the “Rental Practices”).  These agreements typically provided for the use of an exam room once or twice a month, as well as for the use of basic equipment ( e.g. , a telephone and a computer) and front desk staff to assist with scheduling.  The defendants often agreed to pay thousands of dollars each month in rent.  RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC also entered into independent contractor agreements with dozens of cardiologists (the “Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists”) who were sent to see patients at the Rental Practices.  In exchange for the purported “rental payments,” the Rental Practices referred patients to the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists, who in turn referred many of these patients to a GRAMERCY CARDIAC office to undergo cardiac diagnostic tests and procedures.  RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC paid the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists a flat fee for each test or procedure performed on referred patients at a Gramercy Cardiac location, with larger fees paid for tests and procedures for which GRAMERCY CARDIAC received a greater reimbursement.  These per-procedure fees were the only compensation paid to some Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists. To ensure the kickbacks paid to the Rental Practices were working, RENTROP directed his staff to calculate GRAMERCY CARDIAC’s return on investment from the “rental payments” paid to each Rental Practice.  RENTROP insisted on a minimum return on investment of at least 300% from the kickbacks. These Rental Practices referred tens of thousands of patients to the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists, who in turn referred more than 23,000 patients for PET and SPECT scans at GRAMERCY CARDIAC.  A significant proportion of these patients were Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries: GRAMERCY CARDIAC billed Medicare or Medicaid for tests or procedures provided to tens of thousands of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries who were referred by the Rental Practices, including for PET and SPECT scans for many thousands of these beneficiaries.  As a result, the claims submitted for payment for these tests and procedures were false and violated the federal False Claims Act. As part of the settlement, RENTROP and GRAMERCY CARDIAC each admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: From 2010 through 2021, GRAMERCY CARDIAC, at RENTROP’s direction, entered into rental agreements (the “Rental Agreements”) with more than 130 physicians and medical practices (the “Rental Practices”) under which GRAMERCY CARDIAC leased a portion of the practice’s office space, usually one or two exam rooms for certain days or hours each month.  RENTROP took part in the negotiation of the Rental Agreements and signed them on behalf of GRAMERCY CARDIAC.  GRAMERCY CARDIAC paid a total of more than $11 million to the Rental Practices pursuant to the Rental Agreements. From 2010 through 2021, GRAMERCY CARDIAC, at RENTROP’s direction, entered into independent contractor agreements (the “Independent Contractor Agreements”) with more than 50 cardiologists (the “Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists”) or their medical practices.  RENTROP took part in the negotiation of the Independent Contractor Agreements and signed them on behalf of GRAMERCY CARDIAC. GRAMERCY CARDIAC sent the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists to the rented office space one or more times each month to see patients who were referred for an assessment by the healthcare providers at the Rental Practice.  The Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists in turn referred these patients to GRAMERCY CARDIAC to undergo diagnostic tests and procedures, such as PET and SPECT scans. GRAMERCY CARDIAC paid many of the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists a flat fee for each diagnostic test or procedure which the cardiologist referred to GRAMERCY CARDIAC provided that the patient received the test or procedure at a GRAMERCY CARDIAC location.  These “per procedure” fees were the only compensation GRAMERCY CARDIAC provided to the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists. Certain versions of Independent Contractor Agreements stated that the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologist was to be paid not for the referrals to GRAMERCY CARDIAC, but rather for the “[a]dministration and supervision” of the PET and SPECT scans to be performed at GRAMERCY CARDIAC.  However, in many cases, the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists did not, in fact, administer and supervise the PET and SPECT scans and were nonetheless paid by GRAMERCY CARDIAC based solely on the number of tests and procedures referred. At the time the Rental Agreements were executed, it was understood that the Rental Practices would refer their patients to the Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists.  Indeed, GRAMERCY CARDIAC calculated the number of hours per month that GRAMERCY CARDIAC leased the office space based on the volume of expected patient referrals. GRAMERCY CARDIAC calculated its return on investment from its Rental Agreements — which it internally referred to as the “efficiency” of the Rental Agreements — by comparing the revenue GRAMERCY CARDIAC generated from the patient referrals to the payments it made to the Rental Practice. When a Rental Agreement’s return on investment fell below the minimum threshold, GRAMERCY CARDIAC, at RENTROP’s direction, would often refuse to pay the Rental Practice the amounts due under the Rental Agreement.  In addition, at RENTROP’s direction, GRAMERCY CARDIAC Physician Liaisons advised Rental Practice physicians that if the volume of referrals to Gramercy-Contracted Cardiologists did not increase, rent would be decreased, or the Rental Agreement would be terminated.  GRAMERCY CARDIAC terminated a number of Rental Agreements because the return on investment through patient referrals was too low. When negotiating or re-negotiating the monthly rental payment to be made under a Rental Agreement, GRAMERCY CARDIAC took into account the expected or historic return on investment based on the volume of patient referrals generated from the Rental Practice. The rental fees paid by GRAMERCY CARDIAC under the Rental Agreements were in excess of fair market value for at least some Rental Agreements. In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that had been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. *                *                * Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of HHS-OIG, and he thanked the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit at the New York State Attorney General’s Office for its extensive collaboration in the investigation. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Lillywhite is in charge of the case.

Under the settlement agreements approved by U.S. District Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, the estate of the owner of MORRIS PARK at the time of the conduct alleged in the Complaint will pay to the United States $2.85 million, WEINBERG will pay $495,000, and ARM will pay $115,000.  Each defendant also made extensive factual admissions regarding their conduct.  The settlement with the estate took into consideration MORRIS PARK’s prior voluntary self-disclosure of facts related to the improper changes made to residents’ insurance coverage. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Morris Park and its former Administrator prioritized boosting Medicare payments above compliance with the law.  They paid cash kickbacks to obtain patient referrals to fill empty beds and switched residents’ insurance coverage without properly obtaining the residents’ consent in order to increase the amount the facility was paid.  This Office is committed to pursuing all violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and other laws designed to ensure that medical decisions are based only on the patient’s best interest.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz said: “The misconduct that occurred at Morris Park exhibits the prioritization of profits over residents’ best interests.  This nursing home paid illegal kickbacks to manipulate the resident referral process and changed patients’ health coverage selections without properly obtaining their consent, with no apparent concern for how these events could negatively impact residents.  HHS-OIG and our fellow law enforcement agencies strive to ensure that entities furnishing services to Medicare enrollees are operating in accordance with federal health care laws.” Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, known as Original Medicare, or in Medicare Part C Advantage Plans (“MA Plans”), which are administered by private companies that contract with the government.  Under Original Medicare, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) directly reimburses healthcare providers, like skilled nursing facilities, on a fee-for-service basis.  In contrast, when reimbursing services provided under MA Plans, CMS pays Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”), which operate the MA Plans, a fixed, capitated amount each month for each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in the MA Plan.  CMS advises individuals to consider various factors in deciding between enrolling in an MA Plan or Original Medicare, such as differences in out-of-pocket costs and doctor choice. As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: It is well known within the skilled nursing facility industry that it is usually more profitable for the facility to admit residents enrolled in Original Medicare than in MA Plans.  The defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes to increase the number of Original Medicare residents at MORRIS PARK. Payment of Cash Kickbacks for Patient Referrals From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, MORRIS PARK offered and paid remuneration in the form of cash payments, meals, and sports tickets to a Jacobi discharge planning supervisor (the “Jacobi Manager”) to induce her to refer Original Medicare beneficiaries for admission to MORRIS PARK.  For much of this period, MORRIS PARK paid the Jacobi Manager $150 for each referred patient who was admitted to the facility.  WEINBERG was responsible for delivering the cash payments personally to the Jacobi Manager, often arranging to meet her at a CVS parking lot close to MORRIS PARK.  He regularly reached out to the Jacobi Manager to request patient referrals when MORRIS PARK had empty beds. MORRIS PARK paid the Jacobi Manager a total of approximately $5,000 to $10,000 for referring dozens of Original Medicare patients for admission to MORRIS PARK.  In addition, MORRIS PARK offered the Jacobi Manager tickets to Yankees games, invited her and her staff to a MORRIS PARK-sponsored holiday party, and frequently arranged for food to be delivered to her office. Scheme to Switch Residents’ Medicare Coverage From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019, MORRIS PARK, at the direction of WEINBERG, disenrolled residents from their self-selected MA Plans and enrolled them in Original Medicare without obtaining the consent of the residents or their authorized representatives.  WEINBERG pressured MORRIS PARK staff to disenroll residents from their MA Plans. MORRIS PARK staff approached residents, often at their bedside, to try to persuade them to switch their insurance coverage.  When talking to residents and their families, MORRIS PARK staff typically did not fully explain how the change to Original Medicare would impact the resident’s coverage, including potential changes to the resident’s co-payments and deductibles; the potential loss of supplemental coverage available under the resident’s MA Plan; any resulting change in the resident’s drug plan; or limitations on when the resident could re-enroll in the plan after leaving MORRIS PARK.  In most cases, the defendants switched residents’ insurance coverage without getting the residents or their family members to sign a consent form evidencing the resident’s consent to the insurance change.  In certain instances, at the direction of WEINBERG, MORRIS PARK staff offered to reduce or waive the co-payments that would be owed by residents under Original Medicare in order to try to persuade them to agree to disenroll from their MA Plan. In the summer of 2018, on WEINBERG’s recommendation, MORRIS PARK retained WEINBERG’s friend, ARM (who worked at another skilled nursing facility) to assist with the improper disenrollments.  MORRIS PARK paid ARM a $1,000 fee for each resident whom ARM helped to switch to Original Medicare.  ARM agreed to split this $1,000 fee with WEINBERG, so WEINBERG would pocket $500 for each resident who was disenrolled. The settlement with the estate of the owner of MORRIS PARK at the time of the misconduct includes the following admissions of conduct: During the period from 2017 through 2019, MORRIS PARK offered to make, and in fact made, cash payments to the Jacobi Manager for each Original Medicare patient referral that resulted in an admission to the facility.  For much of this period, the Jacobi Manager received the sum of $150 for each referral. During the period from 2017 through 2019, MORRIS PARK admitted dozens of Medicare patients who were referred to the facility by Jacobi. In order to persuade residents to disenroll from their MA Plans, in many instances, MORRIS PARK staff did not fully explain to residents and their families how a switch to Original Medicare would affect the resident’s coverage, including potential changes to the resident’s co-payments and deductibles and the potential loss of supplemental coverage that was available under the resident’s MA Plan.  In some instances, MORRIS PARK staff offered inducements to residents or their family members to try to persuade them to agree to the disenrollment.  For example, at the direction of WEINBERG, staff sometimes offered to reduce or waive the co-payments that residents would be required to pay starting on the 21 st day of their stay at the facility if they switched to Original Medicare. In most cases, MORRIS PARK disenrolled residents from their MA Plans without obtaining from the resident or any family member a signed disenrollment form or any other document evidencing the resident’s consent to the insurance change.  In several instances, MORRIS PARK disenrolled residents even after the residents and/or their family members had indicated they did not want to switch their Medicare coverage. Starting in early 2019, MORRIS PARK paid WEINBERG monthly cash bonuses if the average number of Original Medicare residents at the facility was maintained at a certain level for a given month.  MORRIS PARK also paid bonuses to marketing and admissions staff members that were tied to the admission of new residents with Original Medicare. As part of his settlement, WEINBERG admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: Starting sometime in 2017, WEINBERG was responsible for delivering the cash payments personally to the Jacobi Manager.  They texted to arrange a time and place to meet in person, often meeting at a CVS parking lot close to MORRIS PARK.  WEINBERG reached out to the Jacobi Manager on numerous occasions to ask for patient referrals so he could fill empty beds at MORRIS PARK. During his time at MORRIS PARK, WEINBERG sought to maximize the number of residents who were enrolled in Original Medicare. Shortly after he became Administrator, WEINBERG directed MORRIS PARK’s staff to try to persuade many of the facility’s residents to disenroll from their MA Plans and to enroll in Original Medicare instead.  WEINBERG identified residents who were candidates for disenrollment and then pressured staff to take steps to switch those residents’ insurance coverage. In the summer of 2018, WEINBERG contacted his friend, ARM, who worked full-time at another skilled nursing facility in the Bronx.  WEINBERG asked ARM to assist with the disenrollment process at MORRIS PARK.  MORRIS PARK reached an agreement with ARM under which MORRIS PARK would pay $1,000 to ARM for each MORRIS PARK resident whom ARM helped to disenroll from a Medicare Advantage Plan and enroll in Original Medicare.  WEINBERG and ARM agreed that they would split this $1,000 payment, so that WEINBERG would receive $500 for each resident disenrolled.  WEINBERG did not disclose this arrangement to MORRIS PARK. Once ARM was retained, the pace of disenrollments dramatically increased.  WEINBERG continued to exert significant pressure on MORRIS PARK staff to disenroll as many residents from Medicare Advantage Plans as possible.  In one instance in July 2019, WEINBERG directed the facility’s Financial Coordinator to disenroll a resident who clearly lacked the capacity to consent to a change in their insurance coverage.  The Financial Coordinator asked WEINBERG “[h]ow do we do a dis enrollment” when the resident “is not alert” and has no family.  WEINBERG responded: “We just do it.” As part of his settlement, ARM admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following conduct: ARM understood that MORRIS PARK would benefit from maximizing the number of residents who were enrolled in Original Medicare because the facility typically received a higher daily reimbursement rate for residents enrolled in Original Medicare as compared to MA Plans, and Original Medicare residents were often approved by Medicare for longer stays in the facility. ARM reached an agreement under which MORRIS PARK would pay $1,000 to ARM for each MORRIS PARK resident whom ARM helped to disenroll from a MA Plan and enroll in Original Medicare.  WEINBERG asked ARM to split this $1,000 payment with him, so that WEINBERG would receive $500 for each resident disenrolled.  ARM agreed.  ARM did not disclose this arrangement to anyone else at MORRIS PARK. From August 2018 through December 2019, MORRIS PARK paid ARM $1,000 for each MORRIS PARK resident who was disenrolled from their MA Plan and enrolled in Original Medicare. Although ARM usually relied on MORRIS PARK staff to obtain and document the resident’s consent, he did not confirm that the resident had actually consented or signed the disenrollment form before processing the disenrollment. *                *                * Mr. Williams thanked HHS-OIG for its assistance with the case.

Under the settlement agreements approved by U.S. District Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, the estate of the owner of MORRIS PARK at the time of the conduct alleged in the Complaint will pay to the United States $2.85 million, WEINBERG will pay $495,000, and ARM will pay $115,000.  Each defendant also made extensive factual admissions regarding their conduct.  The settlement with the estate took into consideration MORRIS PARK’s prior voluntary self-disclosure of facts related to the improper changes made to residents’ insurance coverage. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Morris Park and its former Administrator prioritized boosting Medicare payments above compliance with the law.  They paid cash kickbacks to obtain patient referrals to fill empty beds and switched residents’ insurance coverage without properly obtaining the residents’ consent in order to increase the amount the facility was paid.  This Office is committed to pursuing all violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and other laws designed to ensure that medical decisions are based only on the patient’s best interest.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz said: “The misconduct that occurred at Morris Park exhibits the prioritization of profits over residents’ best interests.  This nursing home paid illegal kickbacks to manipulate the resident referral process and changed patients’ health coverage selections without properly obtaining their consent, with no apparent concern for how these events could negatively impact residents.  HHS-OIG and our fellow law enforcement agencies strive to ensure that entities furnishing services to Medicare enrollees are operating in accordance with federal health care laws.” Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, known as Original Medicare, or in Medicare Part C Advantage Plans (“MA Plans”), which are administered by private companies that contract with the government.  Under Original Medicare, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) directly reimburses healthcare providers, like skilled nursing facilities, on a fee-for-service basis.  In contrast, when reimbursing services provided under MA Plans, CMS pays Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”), which operate the MA Plans, a fixed, capitated amount each month for each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in the MA Plan.  CMS advises individuals to consider various factors in deciding between enrolling in an MA Plan or Original Medicare, such as differences in out-of-pocket costs and doctor choice. As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: It is well known within the skilled nursing facility industry that it is usually more profitable for the facility to admit residents enrolled in Original Medicare than in MA Plans.  The defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes to increase the number of Original Medicare residents at MORRIS PARK. Payment of Cash Kickbacks for Patient Referrals From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, MORRIS PARK offered and paid remuneration in the form of cash payments, meals, and sports tickets to a Jacobi discharge planning supervisor (the “Jacobi Manager”) to induce her to refer Original Medicare beneficiaries for admission to MORRIS PARK.  For much of this period, MORRIS PARK paid the Jacobi Manager $150 for each referred patient who was admitted to the facility.  WEINBERG was responsible for delivering the cash payments personally to the Jacobi Manager, often arranging to meet her at a CVS parking lot close to MORRIS PARK.  He regularly reached out to the Jacobi Manager to request patient referrals when MORRIS PARK had empty beds. MORRIS PARK paid the Jacobi Manager a total of approximately $5,000 to $10,000 for referring dozens of Original Medicare patients for admission to MORRIS PARK.  In addition, MORRIS PARK offered the Jacobi Manager tickets to Yankees games, invited her and her staff to a MORRIS PARK-sponsored holiday party, and frequently arranged for food to be delivered to her office. Scheme to Switch Residents’ Medicare Coverage From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019, MORRIS PARK, at the direction of WEINBERG, disenrolled residents from their self-selected MA Plans and enrolled them in Original Medicare without obtaining the consent of the residents or their authorized representatives.  WEINBERG pressured MORRIS PARK staff to disenroll residents from their MA Plans. MORRIS PARK staff approached residents, often at their bedside, to try to persuade them to switch their insurance coverage.  When talking to residents and their families, MORRIS PARK staff typically did not fully explain how the change to Original Medicare would impact the resident’s coverage, including potential changes to the resident’s co-payments and deductibles; the potential loss of supplemental coverage available under the resident’s MA Plan; any resulting change in the resident’s drug plan; or limitations on when the resident could re-enroll in the plan after leaving MORRIS PARK.  In most cases, the defendants switched residents’ insurance coverage without getting the residents or their family members to sign a consent form evidencing the resident’s consent to the insurance change.  In certain instances, at the direction of WEINBERG, MORRIS PARK staff offered to reduce or waive the co-payments that would be owed by residents under Original Medicare in order to try to persuade them to agree to disenroll from their MA Plan. In the summer of 2018, on WEINBERG’s recommendation, MORRIS PARK retained WEINBERG’s friend, ARM (who worked at another skilled nursing facility) to assist with the improper disenrollments.  MORRIS PARK paid ARM a $1,000 fee for each resident whom ARM helped to switch to Original Medicare.  ARM agreed to split this $1,000 fee with WEINBERG, so WEINBERG would pocket $500 for each resident who was disenrolled. The settlement with the estate of the owner of MORRIS PARK at the time of the misconduct includes the following admissions of conduct: During the period from 2017 through 2019, MORRIS PARK offered to make, and in fact made, cash payments to the Jacobi Manager for each Original Medicare patient referral that resulted in an admission to the facility.  For much of this period, the Jacobi Manager received the sum of $150 for each referral.

Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Gregory E. Demske, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge of HHS-OIG’s New York Regional Office, Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the U.S. Department of Defense - Office of Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), and Christopher Algieri, Special Agent in Charge the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office (“VA OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled a civil fraud lawsuit against NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION (“NOVARTIS”), part of Swiss drug manufacturer Novartis International AG, alleging that NOVARTIS violated the federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute by providing doctors with cash payments, recreational outings, lavish meals, and expensive alcohol to induce them to prescribe NOVARTIS cardiovascular and diabetes drugs reimbursed by federal healthcare programs.  Specifically, the Government alleged that NOVARTIS organized tens of thousands of sham educational events at high-end restaurants and other venues, paid exorbitant speaker fees to doctors who gave no meaningful presentations, and provided expensive meals and alcohol to doctor attendees and their guests.  When those doctors then prescribed NOVARTIS’s cardiovascular and diabetes drugs, federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for these tainted prescriptions.  As part of the settlement, approved today by U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe, NOVARTIS will pay the United States and various States a total of $678 million.  NOVARTIS also made extensive factual admissions in the settlement and agreed to strict limitations on any future speaker programs, including reductions to the amount it may spend on such programs. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “For more than a decade, Novartis spent hundreds of millions of dollars on so-called speaker programs, including speaking fees, exorbitant meals, and top-shelf alcohol that were nothing more than bribes to get doctors across the country to prescribe Novartis’s drugs.  Giving these cash payments and other lavish goodies interferes with the duty of doctors to choose the best treatment for their patients and increases drug costs for everyone.  This Office will continue to be vigilant in cracking down on kickbacks, however they may be dressed up, throughout the pharmaceutical industry.” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge said:  “Not only did Novartis incentivize doctors to host these speaking events, reps bribed the doctors to write more prescriptions of the company’s drugs to give Novartis an advantage over competitors within their field.  Greed replaced the responsibility the public expects from those who practice medicine, not to mention the potential for an erosion of trust in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.  This conduct was reprehensible and dishonest.  Patients and consumers deserve better, and our office will continue to pursue any similar allegations of this kind.” HHS-OIG Chief Counsel Gregory Demske said:  “OIG will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice to investigate and pursue kickbacks regardless of the form they take.  To address Novartis’s conduct and the widely-recognized compliance risks associated with paid speaker programs, the CIA requires Novartis to make fundamental changes to its speaker program practices.  Under the CIA, Novartis must significantly reduce the number of programs and the number of paid physicians, and can no longer pay for inherently-risky in-person programs.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “The various kickback schemes employed by Novartis threatened the impartiality of medical decision-making and the financial integrity of Medicare and Medicaid.  Greed must never play a part in patient care.  Along with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable when they step over the line to maximize their market share at the expense of taxpayer-funded federal health care programs.” DCIS Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey said:  “Protecting the integrity of TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their dependents, is a top priority for the DCIS.  When pharmaceutical corporations offer kickbacks and engage in other fraudulent activity to induce medical professionals to prescribe their products, they undermine the integrity of TRICARE and other healthcare plans.  The settlement agreement announced today is the result of a joint effort and demonstrates the DCIS’s ongoing commitment to work with its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, to investigate and prosecute companies that seek to profit by engaging in schemes such as those identified in this case.” VA-OIG Special Agent in Charge Christopher Algieri said:  “Kickback schemes undermine our federal healthcare programs, including healthcare benefits administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  We will continue to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to protect the quality of veterans’ healthcare and integrity of VA’s programs.” In its Complaint in this lawsuit, the Government alleged that between 2002 and 2011 (the “Relevant Period”), NOVARTIS hosted tens of thousands of speaker programs and related events under the guise of providing educational content, when in fact the events served as nothing more than a means to provide bribes to doctors.  NOVARTIS paid physicians honoraria, purportedly as compensation for delivering a lecture regarding a NOVARTIS medication, but, as NOVARTIS knew, many of these programs were nothing more than social events held at expensive restaurants, with little or no discussion about the NOVARTIS drugs.  Indeed, some of the so-called speaker events never even took place; the speaker was simply paid a fee in order to induce the speaker to prescribe NOVARTIS drugs. The Government’s complaint further alleged that NOVARTIS sales representatives, on the instruction of their managers, selected high-volume prescribers to serve as the paid “speakers” at these events with the intent to induce them to write more – or keep writing many – NOVARTIS prescriptions.  The sales representatives then pressured the speakers to increase their prescriptions of NOVARTIS drugs, and often dropped doctors from the program if they failed to do so.  Further, the Government alleged that this widespread kickback scheme was the result of decisions made by top management at NOVARTIS’s North American headquarters in New Jersey. As part of the settlement, NOVARTIS admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government including the following: Some NOVARTIS sales representatives intended the honoraria paid to doctors to be an inducement to these doctors to prescribe more NOVARTIS drugs. NOVARTIS paid many high-prescribing doctors tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in honoraria. In thousands of instances, NOVARTIS paid for the same group of doctors, often colleagues or friends, to have dinners together repeatedly.  Doctors in these groups would sometimes rotate being the speaker and receiving the honorarium payment. NOVARTIS sales representatives hosted programs at some of the most expensive restaurants in the United States, intending to induce the doctors in attendance to continue to write NOVARTIS prescriptions.  These restaurants included some of the most high-end restaurants in the country, such as Masa, Daniel, Gramercy Tavern, Il Mulino, Babbo, Peter Luger, Le Bernardin, and Eleven Madison Park in New York City; Charlie Palmer’s in Washington, D.C.; Morton’s Steakhouse and the Four Seasons in Chicago; Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami; Abacus, Nobu, and the Four Seasons in Dallas; Gary Danko in San Francisco; Patina and Matsuhisa in Los Angeles; Grill 225 in South Carolina; and Commander’s Palace in New Orleans. Throughout the Relevant Period, more than 12,000 speaker programs and roundtables had meal spends that were considerably in excess of the $125 per person limit set by NOVARTIS’s compliance policies. For example, in 2008, at a speaker program held at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse in Pikesville, Maryland, NOVARTIS held an event with only one doctor in the audience for the speaker’s presentation, at which it spent $448 per person on food and alcohol, in addition to the $1,000 honorarium payment provided to the speaker. During the Relevant Period, some NOVARTIS sales representatives conducted programs at venues where the focus was on entertainment, including fishing trips, sporting events, wine tastings, and hibachi tables.  NOVARTIS conducted hundreds of events at wineries and golf clubs. Sales representatives also conducted events at Hooters. At many of NOVARTIS’s speaker programs, the sales representative hosting the event did not require the speaker, who was being paid an honorarium, to deliver a presentation at all, or allowed the speaker to click through the power point presentation in a matter of minutes.  In those instances, the majority of the time was spent socializing and enjoying dinner. NOVARTIS in a number of instances paid doctors honoraria for purportedly speaking at events that never took place. On Long Island, at least one NOVARTIS sales representative organized fraudulent speaker programs by arranging for a restaurant to create fake receipts to make it appear that a dinner had taken place, and then using the budgeted funds to purchase gift cards that were distributed to high-prescribing doctors.  Doctors were then also paid honoraria for “speaking” at these sham events. NOVARTIS’s compliance training materials suggested that emails advocating illegal kickbacks were improper in part because they “reflect[] ignorance of the import of written communications, and put[] the Company at risk.” NOVARTIS’s Chief Compliance Officer also stated in training presentations:  “If you don't have to write it, don’t.  Consider using the phone.” Under the settlement, NOVARTIS will pay a total of $678,000,000, of which (i) $591,442,008.92 will be paid to the United States as False Claims Act damages, (ii) $38,406,717.42 will be forfeited to the United States as proceeds of violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (iii) $48,151,273.66 will be paid to various States. The settlement also requires NOVARTIS to reform its business practices. Contemporaneously with this settlement, NOVARTIS has entered into a corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) with HHS-OIG that will significantly curtail the company’s ability to conduct speaker programs going forward, and will dramatically reduce the amount of money that NOVARTIS may spend on such programs.  Under the five-year CIA, NOVARTIS speaker programs are only permitted under limited circumstances and must be conducted in a virtual format such as a webinar.  The CIA also requires multi-faceted monitoring of NOVARTIS’s operations and obligates company executives and Board members to certify compliance annually with the terms of the CIA.  The strict limitations on speaker programs imposed by the CIA are also incorporated into the settlement.  The settlement provides procedures for the Government to raise violations of these requirements with the district court. This matter was initially brought to the Government’s attention by a whistleblower who filed a complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act. Ms. Strauss praised the investigative work of the FBI, HHS-OIG, and DCIS.  She also thanked the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Division in Washington, D.C., and the Office of Counsel to the Inspector General of HHS for their critical assistance in this case. The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeannette Vargas, Pierre Armand, Mónica Folch, Jacob Lillywhite, Jennifer Jude, and Jacob Bergman are in charge of the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Wilson of the Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit is responsible for the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Gregory E. Demske, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), Scott J. Lampert, Special Agent in Charge of HHS-OIG’s New York Regional Office, Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the U.S. Department of Defense - Office of Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), and Christopher Algieri, Special Agent in Charge the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Field Office (“VA OIG”), announced today that the United States has settled a civil fraud lawsuit against NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION (“NOVARTIS”), part of Swiss drug manufacturer Novartis International AG, alleging that NOVARTIS violated the federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute by providing doctors with cash payments, recreational outings, lavish meals, and expensive alcohol to induce them to prescribe NOVARTIS cardiovascular and diabetes drugs reimbursed by federal healthcare programs.  Specifically, the Government alleged that NOVARTIS organized tens of thousands of sham educational events at high-end restaurants and other venues, paid exorbitant speaker fees to doctors who gave no meaningful presentations, and provided expensive meals and alcohol to doctor attendees and their guests.  When those doctors then prescribed NOVARTIS’s cardiovascular and diabetes drugs, federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for these tainted prescriptions.  As part of the settlement, approved today by U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe, NOVARTIS will pay the United States and various States a total of $678 million.  NOVARTIS also made extensive factual admissions in the settlement and agreed to strict limitations on any future speaker programs, including reductions to the amount it may spend on such programs. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “For more than a decade, Novartis spent hundreds of millions of dollars on so-called speaker programs, including speaking fees, exorbitant meals, and top-shelf alcohol that were nothing more than bribes to get doctors across the country to prescribe Novartis’s drugs.  Giving these cash payments and other lavish goodies interferes with the duty of doctors to choose the best treatment for their patients and increases drug costs for everyone.  This Office will continue to be vigilant in cracking down on kickbacks, however they may be dressed up, throughout the pharmaceutical industry.” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge said:  “Not only did Novartis incentivize doctors to host these speaking events, reps bribed the doctors to write more prescriptions of the company’s drugs to give Novartis an advantage over competitors within their field.  Greed replaced the responsibility the public expects from those who practice medicine, not to mention the potential for an erosion of trust in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.  This conduct was reprehensible and dishonest.  Patients and consumers deserve better, and our office will continue to pursue any similar allegations of this kind.” HHS-OIG Chief Counsel Gregory Demske said:  “OIG will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice to investigate and pursue kickbacks regardless of the form they take.  To address Novartis’s conduct and the widely-recognized compliance risks associated with paid speaker programs, the CIA requires Novartis to make fundamental changes to its speaker program practices.  Under the CIA, Novartis must significantly reduce the number of programs and the number of paid physicians, and can no longer pay for inherently-risky in-person programs.” HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “The various kickback schemes employed by Novartis threatened the impartiality of medical decision-making and the financial integrity of Medicare and Medicaid.  Greed must never play a part in patient care.  Along with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable when they step over the line to maximize their market share at the expense of taxpayer-funded federal health care programs.” DCIS Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey said:  “Protecting the integrity of TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their dependents, is a top priority for the DCIS.  When pharmaceutical corporations offer kickbacks and engage in other fraudulent activity to induce medical professionals to prescribe their products, they undermine the integrity of TRICARE and other healthcare plans.  The settlement agreement announced today is the result of a joint effort and demonstrates the DCIS’s ongoing commitment to work with its law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, to investigate and prosecute companies that seek to profit by engaging in schemes such as those identified in this case.” VA-OIG Special Agent in Charge Christopher Algieri said:  “Kickback schemes undermine our federal healthcare programs, including healthcare benefits administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  We will continue to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to protect the quality of veterans’ healthcare and integrity of VA’s programs.” In its Complaint in this lawsuit, the Government alleged that between 2002 and 2011 (the “Relevant Period”), NOVARTIS hosted tens of thousands of speaker programs and related events under the guise of providing educational content, when in fact the events served as nothing more than a means to provide bribes to doctors.  NOVARTIS paid physicians honoraria, purportedly as compensation for delivering a lecture regarding a NOVARTIS medication, but, as NOVARTIS knew, many of these programs were nothing more than social events held at expensive restaurants, with little or no discussion about the NOVARTIS drugs.  Indeed, some of the so-called speaker events never even took place; the speaker was simply paid a fee in order to induce the speaker to prescribe NOVARTIS drugs. The Government’s complaint further alleged that NOVARTIS sales representatives, on the instruction of their managers, selected high-volume prescribers to serve as the paid “speakers” at these events with the intent to induce them to write more – or keep writing many – NOVARTIS prescriptions.  The sales representatives then pressured the speakers to increase their prescriptions of NOVARTIS drugs, and often dropped doctors from the program if they failed to do so.  Further, the Government alleged that this widespread kickback scheme was the result of decisions made by top management at NOVARTIS’s North American headquarters in New Jersey. As part of the settlement, NOVARTIS admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government including the following: Some NOVARTIS sales representatives intended the honoraria paid to doctors to be an inducement to these doctors to prescribe more NOVARTIS drugs. NOVARTIS paid many high-prescribing doctors tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in honoraria. In thousands of instances, NOVARTIS paid for the same group of doctors, often colleagues or friends, to have dinners together repeatedly.  Doctors in these groups would sometimes rotate being the speaker and receiving the honorarium payment. NOVARTIS sales representatives hosted programs at some of the most expensive restaurants in the United States, intending to induce the doctors in attendance to continue to write NOVARTIS prescriptions.  These restaurants included some of the most high-end restaurants in the country, such as Masa, Daniel, Gramercy Tavern, Il Mulino, Babbo, Peter Luger, Le Bernardin, and Eleven Madison Park in New York City; Charlie Palmer’s in Washington, D.C.; Morton’s Steakhouse and the Four Seasons in Chicago; Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami; Abacus, Nobu, and the Four Seasons in Dallas; Gary Danko in San Francisco; Patina and Matsuhisa in Los Angeles; Grill 225 in South Carolina; and Commander’s Palace in New Orleans. Throughout the Relevant Period, more than 12,000 speaker programs and roundtables had meal spends that were considerably in excess of the $125 per person limit set by NOVARTIS’s compliance policies. For example, in 2008, at a speaker program held at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse in Pikesville, Maryland, NOVARTIS held an event with only one doctor in the audience for the speaker’s presentation, at which it spent $448 per person on food and alcohol, in addition to the $1,000 honorarium payment provided to the speaker. During the Relevant Period, some NOVARTIS sales representatives conducted programs at venues where the focus was on entertainment, including fishing trips, sporting events, wine tastings, and hibachi tables.  NOVARTIS conducted hundreds of events at wineries and golf clubs. Sales representatives also conducted events at Hooters. At many of NOVARTIS’s speaker programs, the sales representative hosting the event did not require the speaker, who was being paid an honorarium, to deliver a presentation at all, or allowed the speaker to click through the power point presentation in a matter of minutes.  In those instances, the majority of the time was spent socializing and enjoying dinner. NOVARTIS in a number of instances paid doctors honoraria for purportedly speaking at events that never took place. On Long Island, at least one NOVARTIS sales representative organized fraudulent speaker programs by arranging for a restaurant to create fake receipts to make it appear that a dinner had taken place, and then using the budgeted funds to purchase gift cards that were distributed to high-prescribing doctors.  Doctors were then also paid honoraria for “speaking” at these sham events. NOVARTIS’s compliance training materials suggested that emails advocating illegal kickbacks were improper in part because they “reflect[] ignorance of the import of written communications, and put[] the Company at risk.” NOVARTIS’s Chief Compliance Officer also stated in training presentations:  “If you don't have to write it, don’t.  Consider using the phone.” Under the settlement, NOVARTIS will pay a total of $678,000,000, of which (i) $591,442,008.92 will be paid to the United States as False Claims Act damages, (ii) $38,406,717.42 will be forfeited to the United States as proceeds of violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (iii) $48,151,273.66 will be paid to various States. The settlement also requires NOVARTIS to reform its business practices.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Rikers Island has been in crisis for years.  This is a collective failure with deep roots, spanning multiple mayoral administrations and DOC commissioners.  But after eight years of trying every tool in the toolkit, we cannot wait any longer for substantial progress to materialize.  That is why my Office will seek a court-appointed receiver to address the conditions on Rikers Island.” *                *                * In 2015, the United States entered into a consent decree with the City of New York and the DOC to address violations of the constitutional rights of incarcerated individuals at Rikers Island (the “Consent Decree”).  The Consent Decree required DOC to develop and implement a wide range of reforms to reduce the level of violence in the jails and ensure the safety and well-being of people in custody as well as corrections officers.  Over the past eight years, this Office has worked diligently with the Monitor appointed pursuant to the Consent Decree and all parties to address the ongoing unsafe conditions on Rikers Island.  After multiple remedial orders and an Action Plan that has been in place for over a year, on July 10, 2023, the Monitor found that despite some progress in certain areas, DOC has not made “substantial and demonstrable progress in implementing the reforms, initiatives, plans, systems, and practices as outlined in the Action Plan” and “there has not been a substantial reduction in the risk of harm currently facing incarcerated individuals and Department staff.”  In light of these findings, this Office has decided to pursue contempt proceedings and seek additional relief from the Court, including the appointment of a receiver, to address the ongoing risk of harm to both incarcerated individuals and DOC staff.  If appointed, the receiver would report to the Court and have independent authority to take necessary steps to comply with core provisions of the Consent Decree and other Court-ordered relief.

Dreher, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resource Division (“ENRD”), and Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, announced today that the United States has entered into a settlement agreement with the Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“New Kerr-McGee”), and their parent Andarko Petroleum Corporation, in a fraudulent conveyance case brought by the United States and co-plaintiff Anadarko Litigation Trust (the “Trust”) in the bankruptcy of Tronox Inc. and its subsidiaries  (“Tronox”).  The bankruptcy court had previously found, in December 2013, that the historic Kerr-McGee Corporation (“Old Kerr-McGee”) fraudulently conveyed assets to New Kerr-McGee to evade its debts, including its liability for environmental clean-up at contaminated sites around the country.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the defendants agree to pay $5.15 billion to settle the case, of which approximately $4.4 billion will be paid to fund environmental clean-up and for environmental claims.  This is the largest payment ever for the clean-up of environmental contamination. Deputy Attorney General James Cole said: “Kerr-McGee’s businesses all over this country left significant, lasting environmental damage in their wake.  It tried to shed its responsibility for this environmental damage and stick the United States taxpayers with the huge cleanup bill.  Through a lot of hard work, we uncovered this fraud and recovered over $5 billion dollars for the American people.  This settlement demonstrates the Justice Department’s firm commitment to preventing and combating all forms of fraud and to securing environmental justice.” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “If you are responsible for 85 years of poisoning the earth, then you are responsible for cleaning it up.  That’s why this case was brought.  And that’s why the defendants are paying a record $5.15 billion -- to fund that colossal cleanup and to make things right.  The company tried to keep its rewards and shed its responsibilities by playing a corporate shell game, putting its profitable oil-and-gas business in a new entity and leaving behind a bankrupt shell holding the environmental liabilities of the defunct, polluting lines of business.  The company tried to cleanse its valuable business from its toxic legacy liabilities. Now the defendants will pay to cleanse the land and water.” Acting Assistant Attorney General Robert G. Dreher said: “Today’s settlement is a just resolution of an historic injustice to the American people and our environment.  The money recovered will result in clean-ups of a toxic history the Old Kerr-McGee unsuccessfully tried to walk away from.” EPA Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles said:  “EPA’s vigorous pursuit of this case will have a big return for communities across the country.  Companies that pollute can’t escape their responsibility to pay for the cleanup.  EPA will continue to fight for those affected by pollution.” The Fraudulent Conveyance According to the complaints of the Government and the Trust and the December 12, 2013, written opinion of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan L. Gropper: Old Kerr-McGee operated numerous businesses, which included uranium mining, the processing of radioactive thorium, creosote wood treating, and manufacture of perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel.  These operations left contamination across the nation, including radioactive uranium waste across the Navajo Nation; radioactive thorium in Chicago and West Chicago, Illinois; creosote waste in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South; and perchlorate waste in Nevada. In the years prior to 2005, Old Kerr-McGee concluded that the liabilities associated with this environmental contamination were a drag on its “crown jewel” business, the exploration and production of oil and gas.  With the intent of evading these and other liabilities, Old Kerr-McGee created a new corporate entity – defendant New Kerr-McGee – and, through a scheme executed in 2002 and 2005, transferred its valuable oil and gas exploration assets to the new company.  The legacy environmental liabilities were left behind in the old company, which was re-named Tronox, and spun off as a separate company in 2006.  As a result of these transactions, Tronox was rendered insolvent and unable to address its environmental and other liabilities.  In 2009, Tronox went into bankruptcy. The United States and the bankruptcy estate (now represented by the Trust) brought this lawsuit to hold the defendants accountable and require them to repay the value of the assets fraudulently conveyed from Old Kerr-McGee. In its decision, the Court found that Old Kerr-McGee transferred assets with the intent to hinder or delay creditors, including particularly environmental creditors, and also transferred those assets for less than their fair value, which left Tronox insolvent, unable to pay its debts when they came due, and undercapitalized.  Among other things, the Court concluded that: “[T]here can be no dispute that Kerr-McGee acted to free substantially all its assets – certainly its most valuable assets – from 85 years of environmental and tort liabilities.” “[O]verhelming” evidence demonstrated that “Defendants devised, carried out and had complete knowledge that [the transfer of Old Kerr-McGee’s oil and gas exploration and production assets was] part of ‘a single integrated scheme’ to create a ‘pure play’ E&P business [referring to the ‘crown jewel’ oil and gas exploration and production business] free and clear of the legacy liabilities.” “[T]here is no credibility to the uniform testimony of the inner circle [of Old Kerr-McGee management] that isolation of the oil and gas assets from the chemical business had nothing to do with an effort to cleanse the E&P assets from the legacy liabilities.” “The record is replete with evidence that Kerr-McGee misapplied [the] standard [for setting reserves for environmental claims under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles] and thereby understated its liabilities for GAAP purposes.” Statements by former Old Kerr-McGee employees that the cost of this environmental pollution would decline after the  spin-off were “not rooted in reality.” Kerr-McGee had failed to conduct any “contemporaneous analysis of the effect of [its] transactions on the legacy liability creditors,” including the effect it would have on the United States’ environmental claims. The Settlement Under today’s settlement agreement, the defendants will pay $5.15 billion to the Trust to settle the fraudulent conveyance case.  Pursuant to a 2011 settlement between the United States, certain state, local, and tribal governments, and the bankruptcy estate, approximately 88% of the net proceeds of this litigation will be distributed by the trust to the United States, certain state governments, the Navajo Nation, and environmental trusts created to clean up Tronox’s contaminated sites.  The 2011 settlement agreement provides specific percentages of this funding that will be made available to each site. As a result of these agreements, some of the key recoveries for environmental claims and for clean-up of environmental sites are estimated to be the following: $1.1 billion will be paid to a trust charged with cleaning up two dozen other contaminated sites around the country, including the Kerr-McGee Superfund Site in Columbus, Mississippi. $1.1 billion will be paid to a trust responsible for cleaning up a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead.  Lake Mead feeds into the Colorado River, a major source of drinking water in the Southwest. Approximately $985 million will be paid to U.S. EPA to fund the clean-up of abandoned uranium mines on land of the Navajo Nation, where radioactive waste remains from Kerr-McGee mining operations. Approximately $224 million will be paid to U.S. EPA for clean-up of thorium contamination at the Welsbach Superfund Site in Gloucester, New Jersey. Approximately $217 million will be paid to the federal Superfund in repayment of costs previously incurred by EPA cleaning up the Federal Creosote Superfund Site in Manville, New Jersey. Additional amounts will be paid to the United States, states, the Navajo Nation, and environmental trusts for other environmental claims and contaminated sites at issue in this case. The settlement agreement will be lodged with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for a period of at least 30 days before it is submitted for the Court’s approval, in order to provide public notice and to afford members of the public the opportunity to comment on the settlement agreement. Mr. Bharara thanked the Trust, its trustee John C. Hueston, and its counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP, for their critical work on this case.  Mr. Bharara also thanked the many federal, state, and tribal officials who worked tirelessly on this matter.  The litigation of this case was assisted by EPA personnel from around the country; the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce; the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the U.S. Forest Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as numerous state governments and the Navajo Nation. This case was handled by the Environmental Protection Unit and the Tax and Bankruptcy Unit of the SDNY’s Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert William Yalen and Joseph Pantoja, along with Alan S. Tenenbaum, Katherine Kane, Frederick S. Phillips, Marcello Mollo, and Erica Pencak of ENRD, are in charge of this case. Updated May 13, 2015 Component USAO - New York, Southern Press Release Number: 14-095 United States Announces $5.15 Billion Settlement With Anadarko To Pay For Environmental And Toxic Tort Liabilities United States Announces $5.15 Billion Settlement With Anadarko To Pay For Environmental And Toxic Tort Liabilities Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email   Largest Payment for the Clean-Up of Environmental Contamination in History James Cole, Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”), Robert G. Dreher, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resource Division (“ENRD”), and Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, announced today that the United States has entered into a settlement agreement with the Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“New Kerr-McGee”), and their parent Andarko Petroleum Corporation, in a fraudulent conveyance case brought by the United States and co-plaintiff Anadarko Litigation Trust (the “Trust”) in the bankruptcy of Tronox Inc. and its subsidiaries  (“Tronox”).  The bankruptcy court had previously found, in December 2013, that the historic Kerr-McGee Corporation (“Old Kerr-McGee”) fraudulently conveyed assets to New Kerr-McGee to evade its debts, including its liability for environmental clean-up at contaminated sites around the country.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the defendants agree to pay $5.15 billion to settle the case, of which approximately $4.4 billion will be paid to fund environmental clean-up and for environmental claims.  This is the largest payment ever for the clean-up of environmental contamination. Deputy Attorney General James Cole said: “Kerr-McGee’s businesses all over this country left significant, lasting environmental damage in their wake.  It tried to shed its responsibility for this environmental damage and stick the United States taxpayers with the huge cleanup bill.  Through a lot of hard work, we uncovered this fraud and recovered over $5 billion dollars for the American people.  This settlement demonstrates the Justice Department’s firm commitment to preventing and combating all forms of fraud and to securing environmental justice.” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “If you are responsible for 85 years of poisoning the earth, then you are responsible for cleaning it up.  That’s why this case was brought.  And that’s why the defendants are paying a record $5.15 billion -- to fund that colossal cleanup and to make things right.  The company tried to keep its rewards and shed its responsibilities by playing a corporate shell game, putting its profitable oil-and-gas business in a new entity and leaving behind a bankrupt shell holding the environmental liabilities of the defunct, polluting lines of business.  The company tried to cleanse its valuable business from its toxic legacy liabilities. Now the defendants will pay to cleanse the land and water.” Acting Assistant Attorney General Robert G. Dreher said: “Today’s settlement is a just resolution of an historic injustice to the American people and our environment.  The money recovered will result in clean-ups of a toxic history the Old Kerr-McGee unsuccessfully tried to walk away from.” EPA Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles said:  “EPA’s vigorous pursuit of this case will have a big return for communities across the country.  Companies that pollute can’t escape their responsibility to pay for the cleanup.  EPA will continue to fight for those affected by pollution.” The Fraudulent Conveyance According to the complaints of the Government and the Trust and the December 12, 2013, written opinion of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan L. Gropper: Old Kerr-McGee operated numerous businesses, which included uranium mining, the processing of radioactive thorium, creosote wood treating, and manufacture of perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel.  These operations left contamination across the nation, including radioactive uranium waste across the Navajo Nation; radioactive thorium in Chicago and West Chicago, Illinois; creosote waste in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South; and perchlorate waste in Nevada. In the years prior to 2005, Old Kerr-McGee concluded that the liabilities associated with this environmental contamination were a drag on its “crown jewel” business, the exploration and production of oil and gas.  With the intent of evading these and other liabilities, Old Kerr-McGee created a new corporate entity – defendant New Kerr-McGee – and, through a scheme executed in 2002 and 2005, transferred its valuable oil and gas exploration assets to the new company.  The legacy environmental liabilities were left behind in the old company, which was re-named Tronox, and spun off as a separate company in 2006.

(“ARTIMUS”).  Under the settlement, ARTIMUS has agreed to make retrofits at rental buildings in Harlem and Chelsea, named Susan’s Court and Chelsea Park, respectively.  ARTIMUS also agreed to provide $75,000 to compensate aggrieved persons and pay a $5,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, ARTIMUS agreed to establish procedures to survey four additional properties, two in Manhattan and two in Queens, to improve accessibility and agreed to ensure that its future residential development projects will comply with the accessibility requirements of the FHA.  The settlement was approved today by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “This Office has brought multiple suits to address the failure of real estate developers to comply with the Fair Housing Act, and we will continue to ensure that New York City’s residential housing market is open to everyone, including people with disabilities.  We appreciate Artimus’s cooperation in remedying the inaccessible conditions in their buildings.” According to the allegations in the complaint and the settlement approved today: The FHA’s accessible design and construction provisions require multifamily housing complexes constructed after January 1991 to have basic features accessible to persons with disabilities.  The inaccessible conditions at ARTIMUS’s rental buildings included excessively high thresholds at building entrances and entrances to common use areas, common use bathrooms that lack grab bars and pipe insulation, excessively high thresholds at entrances to individual apartments and within the apartments, and bathrooms in individual apartments that lack sufficient clear floor space for people who use wheelchairs.  These features in the common use areas of ARTIMUS’s buildings, as well as in the buildings’ apartment interiors, did not meet the specifications set forth in the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, Design Guidelines for Accessible/Adaptable Dwellings. Under the settlement, ARTIMUS agreed to make retrofits to the public and common use areas as well as the individual units at the Chelsea Park and Susan’s Court buildings to improve accessibility.  The settlement also requires ARTIMUS to establish procedures to ensure FHA compliance at its future development projects, including to retain an FHA compliance consultant to assess the design documents and conduct site visits to identify non-compliant conditions.  In addition, ARTIMUS agreed to institute policies and training to ensure that its employees and agents will comply with the FHA’s accessibility requirements. Finally, the settlement requires ARTIMUS to provide $75,000 to compensate aggrieved persons.  Aggrieved persons may be entitled to monetary compensation from the fund created through today’s settlement.  Aggrieved individuals may include those who: Were discouraged from living at ARTIMUS’s rental buildings because of the lack of accessible features; Have been hurt in any way by the lack of accessible features at ARTIMUS’s rental buildings; Paid to have an apartment at one of ARTIMUS’s rental buildings made more accessible to persons with disabilities; or Otherwise were discriminated against on the basis of disability at one of ARTIMUS’s rental buildings as a result of inaccessible design and construction. *                *                * The settlement with ARTIMUS is the 18th settlement reached by this Office with developers and architects to remedy inaccessible housing in this District, including suits against The Durst Organization, Glenwood Management, Silverstein Properties, Related Companies, and Atlantic Development. Any individual who may be entitled to compensation can file a claim by using the Civil Rights Complaint Form available on the United States Attorney’s Office’s website https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/civil-rights or by sending a written claim to: U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York 86 Chambers Street, 3rd Floor New York, New York 10007 Attention: Chief, Civil Rights Unit The case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney David J.

Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”), Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), and Andrew Wheeler, Acting Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), announced today the signing of an administrative agreement (“Agreement”) with the NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY (“NYCHA”) and the CITY OF NEW YORK (the “City”) requiring NYCHA, under the supervision of a federal monitor, to fundamentally reform its operations and remedy living conditions for its residents, including lead paint hazards, mold growth, pest infestations, lack of heat, and inadequate elevator service.  The Agreement, which went into effect immediately and does not require court approval, resolves the United States’ claims against NYCHA detailed in the Complaint filed in United States District Court on June 11, 2018 (the “Complaint”), which will be dismissed without prejudice.  The Complaint alleged that for years NYCHA had violated and was continuing to violate basic federal health and safety regulations, including regulations requiring NYCHA to protect children from lead paint and otherwise provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing.  The Complaint further alleged that NYCHA repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the public regarding its lead paint compliance, and intentionally deceived HUD inspectors. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated:  “NYCHA’s failure to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing is simply unacceptable, and illegal.  Children must be protected from toxic lead paint, apartments must be free of mold and pest infestations, and developments must provide adequate heat in winter and elevator service.  This Office has not wavered from its commitment to better living conditions for NYCHA residents.  Today’s Agreement will improve the lives of the more than 400,000 New Yorkers who call NYCHA home.  The Agreement goes beyond the prior proposed Consent Decree by providing strict, enforceable standards that NYCHA must meet by particular deadlines for the five critical living conditions, including requiring both the immediate remediation of lead paint in apartments with children under 6 years old and, over time, 100 percent abatement of all lead paint in all NYCHA developments, as well as a change in NYCHA leadership.” HUD Secretary Ben Carson said:  “This is a very positive outcome, one that I believe can bring meaningful change to living conditions of the many thousands of families who depend upon NYCHA for their housing.  But there is still a lot of work to be carried out.  We look forward to continuing what has been a productive working relationship with the Mayor and his team.  HUD will continue to advocate for the hundreds of thousands of children, women, and men in New York City whose lives and livelihoods depend on having safe, fair, and affordable housing.  They deserve nothing less.” Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said:  “Under today’s agreement, New York City commits to provide the resources and institutional reforms needed to end NYCHA’s pattern and practice of endangering the health of children living in New York’s public housing.  EPA will be vigilant and is prepared to reinstate our litigation should they fail to meet those commitments and continue to harm children by violating lead paint safety regulations.” Based on NYCHA’s misconduct as detailed in the Complaint, the Secretary of HUD declared today that NYCHA is in substantial default of its covenant to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing.  The purpose of the Agreement is to remedy the deficient physical conditions in NYCHA properties, ensure that NYCHA complies with its obligations under federal law, reform the management structure of NYCHA, and facilitate cooperation and coordination between HUD, NYCHA, and the City. Specifically, the Agreement requires NYCHA to remediate living conditions at NYCHA properties by specific deadlines and meet strict, objective compliance standards regarding lead paint hazards, mold growth, pest infestations, and inadequate heating and elevator service.  With respect to lead paint hazards, for example, the Agreement requires NYCHA to take action within 30 days to visually inspect all non-exempt units built before 1978 where NYCHA believes a child under 6 resides or routinely visits and remediate any deteriorated lead-based paint in the apartment, and, over time, to abate all lead paint in all NYCHA developments.  The Agreement further obligates NYCHA to establish three new critical functions:  a Compliance Department, an Environmental Health and Safety Department, and a Quality Assurance Unit.  In addition, the Agreement requires the City to select a new chief executive officer for NYCHA from a list of qualified professionals jointly compiled by HUD, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the City. The Agreement also renews the City’s commitment, reflected in the June 2018 proposed Consent Decree, to provide an additional $1 billion in capital funds to NYCHA over the next four years and an additional $200 million in capital funds each subsequent year for the duration of the Agreement.  Also, the agreement locks in an additional $4 billion in City funds budgeted through 2027. Pursuant to the Agreement, a federal monitor, selected by HUD and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in consultation with NYCHA and the City, will oversee NYCHA’s reform efforts.  Beyond the specifically enumerated remedial actions required under the Agreement, NYCHA will develop action plans, subject to the monitor’s approval, to remediate living conditions at NYCHA and meet the compliance standards set forth in the Agreement.  The monitor and NYCHA also will collaboratively develop a plan to overhaul NYCHA’s organizational, management, and workforce structure, informed by a new comprehensive study from an independent third-party consultant.  Throughout the term of the Agreement, the monitor is required to engage with the community, including NYCHA residents, resident groups, and stakeholders, regarding matters covered by the Agreement, and provide public reports detailing NYCHA’s progress.  The cost of the monitor shall be paid by the City. *                *                * Mr. Berman thanked HUD, HUD Office of Inspector General, and EPA for their invaluable assistance in this matter. This case is being handled by the Office’s Environmental Protection Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant United States Attorneys Robert William Yalen, Mónica P. Folch, Jacob Lillywhite, Talia Kraemer, and Sharanya Mohan are in charge of the case.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “It is simply unacceptable that any student should be denied equal access to an education because of a disability.  We are pleased that CUNY has agreed to provide relief to the student whose education was compromised and that CUNY is committed to improving the accessibility of its courses, including online and digital content, for all future students.” Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating against any individual on the basis of disability by excluding the individual from participation in services, programs, and activities.  The ADA requires public entities to make reasonable modifications to avoid such discrimination and to administer their services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities, including by furnishing appropriate auxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication. The out-of-court agreement resolves an investigation during which the U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that CUNY failed to provide reasonable accommodations required under the ADA for a student with visual impairments at CUNY’s John Jay School of Criminal Justice and identified shortcomings in CUNY’s accessibility and reasonable accommodation policies and procedures.  Specifically, the investigation found, among other things, that CUNY failed to make qualified learning assistants available to ensure an integrated learning setting for the student in numerous science and mathematics courses.  Additionally, John Jay instructors required students to use WebAssign, a third-party online learning product, to complete assignments, but that digital platform was not fully capable of reading out mathematical and scientific symbols and equations.  Furthermore, John Jay repeatedly failed to make usable versions of required textbooks and other course materials available to the student by the start of courses.  The student made a number of attempts to bring the deficiencies to the attention of staff at John Jay and CUNY, but neither John Jay nor CUNY had adequate policies and procedures to ensure that reasonable accommodation requests and related complaints are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.  As a result, the student received unduly poor grades and was forced to forgo taking other desired and required advanced courses for a number of academic years. CUNY has agreed to prepare and implement systemwide policies to ensure improved accessibility of educational content to visually impaired students, including digital learning content, proper training of staff and faculty, and effective reasonable accommodation and complaint procedures. Under the agreement, CUNY will permanently purge all of the affected student’s grades in the relevant courses in which reasonable modifications were not provided and pay the student $10,000 in compensatory damages.  CUNY will also adopt systemwide policies and procedures to ensure: The prompt availability of qualified learning assistants, including by initiating an appropriate and timely search process, involving the relevant affected students in that process, and setting a reasonable level of compensation likely to attract qualified candidates; The prompt availability of accessible course materials by the start of the relevant course or as soon as practicable based upon early consultations with affected students; Reasonable accommodation and complaint mechanisms based on clear, short deadlines by which accommodation requests and complaints must be addressed and remaining concerns are promptly escalated to higher-level administrators as necessary; Information Technology accessibility consistent with the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, including via verification of the accessibility of third-party learning products and of instructors’ awareness of accessibility requirements for instructor-created content; and Training of faculty and accessibility-services staff on ADA requirements. *                *                * This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Cha-Kim is in charge of the case.

Lampert, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), announced today that the United States has filed and settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against TCPRNC, LLC d/b/a PLAZA REHAB AND NURSING CENTER (“PLAZA REHAB CENTER”) and CITADEL CONSULTING GROUP LLC d/b/a CITADEL CARE CENTERS LLC (“CITADEL”). The lawsuit alleges that PLAZA REHAB CENTER, acting at the direction of CITADEL, fraudulently switched the type of Medicare coverage in which elderly residents were enrolled in order to maximize the Medicare payments that PLAZA REHAB CENTER would receive. As alleged in the Government’s complaint, the residents and their families often did not request, consent to, or know about the change to their healthcare coverage, which had the potential to impact their out-of-pocket payments, the scope of the services and care covered, and their drug coverage plan. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “Skilled nursing facility residents have the right to choose their own healthcare insurance coverage.  Plaza Rehab Center frequently changed the insurance of its residents without their consent or knowledge, and without explaining how the change could impact their out-of-pocket costs and the scope of their healthcare coverage.  When facilities unlawfully take advantage of elderly residents in order to maximize their revenue from federal healthcare programs, this Office will hold them accountable.” HHS-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Scott J. Lampert said:  “HHS-OIG is committed to safeguarding Medicare and its beneficiaries from fraud.  Those who exploit federal health care programs for financial gain and violate the trust of beneficiaries must be held accountable for their actions.” Under the settlement, which was approved on June 27, 2022, by U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels, PLAZA REHAB CENTER and CITADEL agreed to pay a total of $7.85 million and made extensive factual admissions regarding their conduct. Specifically, PLAZA REHAB CENTER and CITADEL admitted that their staff often did not obtain the consent of the resident or their authorized representatives prior to disenrolling the resident from their Medicare Advantage Plan. In addition, as part of the settlement, CITADEL agreed to take steps to ensure that all skilled nursing facilities that are Citadel Care Centers comply with applicable guidance on Medicare health plan disenrollments and enrollments. PLAZA REHAB CENTER and CITADEL also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with HHS-OIG, which requires that they maintain a compliance program designed to foster adherence to federal health care program requirements and thereby protect the programs. Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in the original parts of Medicare, known as Original Medicare, or in Medicare Advantage Plans, which are administered by private companies that contract with the government. Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage Plans differ in how healthcare providers, including skilled nursing facilities, seek and receive reimbursement. Under Original Medicare, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) directly reimburses providers, like skilled nursing facilities, on a fee-for-service basis. In contrast, when furnishing medical services to a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, the provider submits claims to the Medicare Advantage Organization (“MAO”) that operates the Medicare Advantage Plan, which in turn pays the provider an agreed-upon amount. CMS pays MAOs a fixed, capitated amount each month for providing coverage for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Plan. CMS advises individuals to consider various factors in deciding between a Medicare Advantage Plan and Original Medicare, such as differences in out-of-pocket costs and doctor choice. As alleged in the Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court: It is well known within the skilled nursing facility industry that it is typically more profitable to admit residents who are enrolled in Original Medicare than residents enrolled in Medicare Advantage Plans. From September 2016 to February 2019, CITADEL exerted pressure on PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff to increase the number of residents enrolled in Original Medicare in order to increase Medicare reimbursements. PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff disenrolled many residents from their self-selected Medicare Advantage Plans and enrolled them in Original Medicare without obtaining the consent of the residents or their authorized representatives. PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff were supposed to ensure that residents (or their authorized representatives) signed “disenrollment forms” prior to effectuating any disenrollment of the resident from their Medicare Advantage Plan. However, in many instances, PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff disenrolled residents from their Medicare Advantage Plan and enrolled them in Original Medicare without obtaining a signed disenrollment form reflecting the resident’s consent. Indeed, PLAZA REHAB CENTER employees effectuated numerous disenrollments without ever speaking to the resident or their authorized representative or explaining the consequences of switching to Original Medicare. In addition, in other instances, PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff discussed a disenrollment with the resident and purportedly obtained the resident’s consent, but the resident did not have the capacity to provide consent because of their health condition. In the settlement agreement, PLAZA REHAB CENTER and CITADEL admit, acknowledge, and accept responsibility for the following conduct: PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff, at the direction and under pressure from a CITADEL manager responsible for the new admission practices, changed PLAZA REHAB CENTER residents’ insurance from Medicare Advantage Plans to Original Medicare after such residents’ admission to PLAZA REHAB CENTER. Among other things, CITADEL set a monthly disenrollment quota for PLAZA REHAB CENTER and identified potential candidates for disenrollment. PLAZA REHAB CENTER earned greater revenues for residents if such residents were enrolled in Original Medicare, as compared to Medicare Advantage Plans. PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff often did not obtain the consent of the resident or their authorized legal representatives prior to disenrolling the resident from their Medicare Advantage Plan and enrolling them in Original Medicare. In approximately 19 instances, PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff purportedly obtained the residents’ consent before disenrolling them from their Medicare Advantage Plan, but, according to these residents’ mental status assessments, they did not have the capacity to provide consent because of their health condition. PLAZA REHAB CENTER regularly failed to consider the results of these mental health assessments and did not evaluate the capacity of residents to consent to the insurance change. PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff effectuated these changes in a resident’s coverage by logging on to the Medicare.gov website using the resident’s personal information. PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff would use this website to disenroll the resident from their self-selected Medicare prescription drug plan, which resulted in the resident automatically being disenrolled from their self-selected Medicare Advantage Plan and being enrolled into Original Medicare. In some instances, when completing the information online to effectuate the disenrollment, PLAZA REHAB CENTER staff misrepresented that they were either: (i) the person listed on the enrollment form; (ii) a person helping the person listed on the enrollment form in completing the form; or (iii) a person authorized to act on behalf of the individual on the enrollment form under the laws of the State where the individual resided. PLAZA REHAB CENTER and CITADEL often did not offer Plaza Rehab Center residents assistance in re-enrolling them in a Medicare Advantage Plan upon discharge from the Plaza Rehab Center facility. As a result of the conduct described above, the Government made payments under Original Medicare to PLAZA REHAB CENTER for residents who were improperly enrolled in Original Medicare without their consent. PLAZA REHAB CENTER was not entitled to these payments. *                *                * In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act. Mr. Williams thanked HHS-OIG for its investigative efforts and assistance with the case. This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Charles S. Jacob is in charge of the case.

The administrative correction mechanisms outlined in the guidelines apply to information disseminated by the Department on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when it was first disseminated. These Guidelines provide procedural guidance to agency staff and inform the public about agency policies and procedures for making corrections to published information. Purpose This Guidance provides the standards for Department of Justice (DOJ)-wide information quality, as required under the Information Quality Act (IQA) and related guidelines. [1] Senior Leadership Offices and Heads of Components (SLOs & HoCs) are responsible for the quality of the information they produce and disseminate to the public. The information in this document is intended as guidance for the SLOs & HoCs. It is not regulation, is not legally enforceable, and does not create any legal rights or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on DOJ or the public. Nothing in this guidance affects any otherwise available judicial review of the agency’s actions. This Guidance does not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidential protections. Oversight / Management Responsibility OMB Memorandum M-19-15 requires agencies to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated to the public, and define mechanisms for redress by affected persons, where appropriate. In response, SLOs & HoCs will use this guidance to: 1. Pre-Dissemination Practices . Establish SLO & HoC information pre-dissemination practices that include: Establishing a basic standard of quality for information maintained and disseminated by the SLO & HoC. Establishing information quality procedures for their SLO & HoC, as necessary, and apply the procedures before disseminating SLO & HoC information. 2. Request for Correction . Establish a process for the public to seek timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the SLO & HoC that does not comply with OMB, DOJ, or SLO & HoC guidelines. 3. Reporting . Report on SLO & HoC IQA practices to JMD as required for OMB reporting. Influential Information SLOs & HoCs will identify and provide additional scrutiny for “influential” information. SLOs & HoCs may designate certain classes of information as "influential" in the context of their specific programs. Absent such designations, SLOs & HoCs will determine whether information is influential on a case-by-case basis, using the principles articulated in this Guidance. The "influential" designation is intended to be applied to information only when clearly appropriate. SLOs & HoCs will not designate information products or types of information as influential on a regular or routine basis. General Exemptions Except for those categories of information exempted ( see below ), this Guidance applies to all information disseminated by DOJ, and DOJ-initiated or sponsored dissemination of information by DOJ grantees, contractors, or cooperators on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated. This Guidance applies not only to information that DOJ generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOJ that DOJ disseminates publicly. This Guidance does not override other compelling interests, including, but not limited to, privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidential protections. Additionally, this Guidance does not apply when the agency's presentation makes it clear that the material offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views. Additional Exemptions for Categories of Information The following non-exhaustive list describes context in which information may be disseminated that are exempted from this Guidance. Limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees unless the agency represents the information as, or uses the information in support of, an official agency position, or the grantee is disseminating the information at the request of the agency, or the grant requires agency approval of the information request Intra-or inter-agency use or sharing of government information Responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law Distribution limited to correspondence with individuals or persons Press releases fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications (in any medium) that announce, support or give public notice of information in DOJ Information relating to subpoenas, or adjudicative processes Archival records disseminated by federal agency libraries or similar federal data repositories Congressional testimony and other submissions to Congress containing information that DOJ has previously provided to the public; and Procedural, operational, policy and internal manuals prepared for the management and operations of DOJ that are not primarily intended for public dissemination Non-public information, including information incorrectly/inadvertently disclosed Civil, criminal, and administrative information for investigations or proceedings Pre-Dissemination Practices SLOs & HoCs will conduct pre-dissemination reviews of their information products that incorporate the following requirements. Quality. During the reviews, consider the level of quality for each type of product it disseminates, based on the utility, objectivity, and integrity of the information. SLOs & HoCs ensure the utility of the information by continuously monitoring information needs and developing new information sources by revising existing methods, models, and information products SLOs & HoCs will ensure objectivity by using reliable data sources, sound analytic techniques, and document methods and data sources. Finally, SLOs & HoCs will maintain the integrity of information, ensuring it is protected from unauthorized access, corruption, or revision. Peer Review of Influential Information. When using scientific information, including third-party data or models, ensure compliance with the requirements of OMB’s Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. [2] When conducting peer review, SLOs & HoCs will ask reviewers to evaluate the objectivity of the underlying data and the sensitivity of the agency’s conclusions to analytic assumptions. When influential information that has been peer reviewed changes significantly (e.g., as a result of the peer reviewer comments, additional agency analysis, or further consideration) the SLO & HoC will conduct a second peer review. Information Protection. While prioritizing increased access to data and analytical frameworks used to generate information, ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, and Department policy requirements for protections of data security, privacy and confidentiality, proprietary data, and the confidentiality of business, law enforcement, and national security information. Ensure that all interests in privacy and confidentiality are protected, and any disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) takes place pursuant to applicable statutory, regulatory, and Department policy requirements. Any questions relating to appropriate disclosure of PII should be coordinated with the Department’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy, the Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer (CPCLO), consistent with DOJ policy. Options for Wider Access. Explore methods that provide wider access to datasets while reducing the risk of improper disclosures of PII. Tiered access [3] offers promising ways to make data widely available while applying protections for security, privacy, confidentiality, and ensuring appropriate access and use. Statistical Information. Engage in statistical activities [4] that are transparent and based on sound statistical methods. Transparency is a broad concept, which can include a clear description of the methods, data sources, assumptions, outcomes, limitations, and related information to permit a data user to understand how the statistical information product was designed or produced. Sound statistical activities and methods generate information (data and analysis) for a statistical purpose [5] that is accurate, reliable, and unbiased. Procedures to promote sound statistical activities and methods will cover the planning of statistical data systems, the collection of statistical data, and the processing of statistical data (including analysis). Transparency refers to a clear description of the methods, data sources, assumptions, outcomes, limitations, and related information to permit a data user to understand how the statistical information was designed or produced. Scientific Information . Ensure documented methods used on the same data set achieve consistent results. Communicate transparently by “including a clear explication of underlying assumptions; accurate contextualization of uncertainties; and a description of the probabilities associate with both optimistic and pessimistic projections, including best-case and worst-case scenarios.” [6] Program, Regulatory and Administrative Information. Establish procedures for clearly documenting and communicating the quality of program, regulatory, or administrative information that has potential for secondary use (aka secondary analysis), or other use. For questions relating to authorized or unauthorized secondary uses or analysis of information that includes PII, SLOs and HoCs should coordinate with Senior Component Officials for Privacy, subject to approval by the CPLO, in order to ensure privacy requirements are met, and risks are managed. Program, Regulatory and Administrative Information. Establish procedures for clearly documenting and communicating the quality of program, regulatory, or administrative information that has potential for authorized secondary use, (aka secondary analysis). For secondary analysis that includes PII, components should coordinate with the Senior Component Officials for Privacy, subject to approval by the CPCLO, to mitigate risks to individual privacy. Non-Government Information. When using non-government sources [7] to create influential information that represents SLO & HoC views, communicate to the public sufficient information on the characteristics of the data and analysis, including its scope, generation protocols, and any other information necessary to allow the public to reproduce the SLO & HoC’s conclusions. Cross Agency Information. When making information originally collected or developed by other Federal agencies available to the public in a cross-agency dissemination, clearly communicate to the public the quality of the information contributed by DOJ. Information Aggregation. Account for the “mosaic effect” of information aggregation, which occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual but when combined with other available information could pose such a risk. Transparent Communication. Provide the public with documentation about each dataset released to allow data users to determine the fitness of the data for the purpose for which third parties may consider using. Such documentation can include the strengths and weaknesses of the data, analytical limitations, security requirements, and processing options. Request for Correction SLOs & HoCs will allow the public to submit a Request for Correction (RFC) when disseminated information does not comply with OMB, DOJ, and SLO & HoC policy, guidelines, and procedures. SLOs & HoCs will process the request in accordance with the below. 120 Calendar Day Response. Respond to RFCs within 120 calendar days of receipt, or obtain concurrence from the requester to an extension. RFC Review. Conduct a thorough review of the information being challenged, the processes that were used to create and disseminate the information and the conformity of the information and processes with OMB, DOJ and SLO & HoC policy, guidelines, and procedures. Provide a point-by-point response addressing data quality arguments in the RFC. Do not opine on the requestor’s or the Department’s policy position. Determine whether a correction is warranted, and, if so, what corrective action to take. The corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information and may include consideration of factors, such as the significance of the information, the magnitude of the error, and the public benefit of making the requested correction. DOJ is not required to change or alter the content or status of information simply based on the receipt of a RFC. Legal and OMB Review. Before releasing responses to the requestor, complete all appropriate internal review, and share the draft response with OMB for its assessment of compliance with OMB guidance. Request for Reconsideration. The requestor may file a Request for Reconsideration within 45 calendar days from the date that DOJ transmitted its decisions from the original RFC. SLOs and HOCs will process the reconsideration request in the same manner as a RFC. However, the same agency personnel who opined during the RFC process will not participate in deciding a Request for Reconsideration. Requestors will be aware they bear the "burden of proof" with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek. DOJ will base its decision on the merits of the information provided by the requestor and may be unable to process, in a timely manner or at all, requests that omit one or more of the requested elements. DOJ will not attempt to contact the requestor to obtain additional information. Requester Information To obtain consideration for a request for correction or reconsideration, requesters will provide the following information to PRA.inbox@usdoj.gov : Statement. The Request for Correction of information or Request for Reconsideration is submitted under DOJ’s Information Quality Guidance. Requestor contact information. Include the name, mailing address, telephone number, fax number (if any), email address (if any), and organization affiliation (if any) of the person requesting the correction. Specific description of information to correct. Include the name of the DOJ report or data product, the date of issuance or other identifying information such as the URL of the web page, and a detailed description that clearly identifies the specific information contained the report or data product for which a correction is being sought. Explanation of noncompliance with OMB and/or DOJ Information Quality Guidance. Provide a description of how the information is incorrect or fails to meet either the OMB or DOJ information quality guidelines. Explanation of the impact of the alleged error. Provide an explanation that specifies how the alleged error harms or how a correction would benefit the requestor. Recommendation and justification for how the information will be corrected. Provide an explanation that gives the requestor’s specific recommendations for how the information will be corrected and that describes the requestor’s position for why DOJ should adopt the recommendation. Supporting documentary evidence. Provide supporting documentary evidence, such as comparable data or research results on the same topic to assist in evaluating the merits of the request. Reporting SLOs & HoCs will report on their information quality practices as required for OMB reporting. This includes reporting on downstream uses of their information collection systems as required by OMB in the Information Collection Request under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).

Updated January 18, 2025 Information Quality Information Quality Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email OMB M-19-15 is in effect DOJ Information Quality Guidelines Ensuring the Quality of the Information Disseminated by the Department Purpose Oversight/Management Responsibility Influential Information General Exemptions Pre-Dissemination Practices Request for Correction Reporting References Ensuring the Quality of the Information Disseminated by the Department The Department of Justice's Information Quality Guidelines are in accordance with the provisions of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) government-wide guidance. The administrative correction mechanisms outlined in the guidelines apply to information disseminated by the Department on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when it was first disseminated. These Guidelines provide procedural guidance to agency staff and inform the public about agency policies and procedures for making corrections to published information. Purpose This Guidance provides the standards for Department of Justice (DOJ)-wide information quality, as required under the Information Quality Act (IQA) and related guidelines. [1] Senior Leadership Offices and Heads of Components (SLOs & HoCs) are responsible for the quality of the information they produce and disseminate to the public. The information in this document is intended as guidance for the SLOs & HoCs. It is not regulation, is not legally enforceable, and does not create any legal rights or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on DOJ or the public. Nothing in this guidance affects any otherwise available judicial review of the agency’s actions. This Guidance does not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidential protections. Oversight / Management Responsibility OMB Memorandum M-19-15 requires agencies to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated to the public, and define mechanisms for redress by affected persons, where appropriate. In response, SLOs & HoCs will use this guidance to: 1. Pre-Dissemination Practices . Establish SLO & HoC information pre-dissemination practices that include: Establishing a basic standard of quality for information maintained and disseminated by the SLO & HoC. Establishing information quality procedures for their SLO & HoC, as necessary, and apply the procedures before disseminating SLO & HoC information. 2. Request for Correction . Establish a process for the public to seek timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the SLO & HoC that does not comply with OMB, DOJ, or SLO & HoC guidelines. 3. Reporting . Report on SLO & HoC IQA practices to JMD as required for OMB reporting. Influential Information SLOs & HoCs will identify and provide additional scrutiny for “influential” information. SLOs & HoCs may designate certain classes of information as "influential" in the context of their specific programs. Absent such designations, SLOs & HoCs will determine whether information is influential on a case-by-case basis, using the principles articulated in this Guidance. The "influential" designation is intended to be applied to information only when clearly appropriate. SLOs & HoCs will not designate information products or types of information as influential on a regular or routine basis. General Exemptions Except for those categories of information exempted ( see below ), this Guidance applies to all information disseminated by DOJ, and DOJ-initiated or sponsored dissemination of information by DOJ grantees, contractors, or cooperators on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated. This Guidance applies not only to information that DOJ generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOJ that DOJ disseminates publicly. This Guidance does not override other compelling interests, including, but not limited to, privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidential protections. Additionally, this Guidance does not apply when the agency's presentation makes it clear that the material offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views. Additional Exemptions for Categories of Information The following non-exhaustive list describes context in which information may be disseminated that are exempted from this Guidance. Limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees unless the agency represents the information as, or uses the information in support of, an official agency position, or the grantee is disseminating the information at the request of the agency, or the grant requires agency approval of the information request Intra-or inter-agency use or sharing of government information Responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law Distribution limited to correspondence with individuals or persons Press releases fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications (in any medium) that announce, support or give public notice of information in DOJ Information relating to subpoenas, or adjudicative processes Archival records disseminated by federal agency libraries or similar federal data repositories Congressional testimony and other submissions to Congress containing information that DOJ has previously provided to the public; and Procedural, operational, policy and internal manuals prepared for the management and operations of DOJ that are not primarily intended for public dissemination Non-public information, including information incorrectly/inadvertently disclosed Civil, criminal, and administrative information for investigations or proceedings Pre-Dissemination Practices SLOs & HoCs will conduct pre-dissemination reviews of their information products that incorporate the following requirements. Quality. During the reviews, consider the level of quality for each type of product it disseminates, based on the utility, objectivity, and integrity of the information. SLOs & HoCs ensure the utility of the information by continuously monitoring information needs and developing new information sources by revising existing methods, models, and information products SLOs & HoCs will ensure objectivity by using reliable data sources, sound analytic techniques, and document methods and data sources. Finally, SLOs & HoCs will maintain the integrity of information, ensuring it is protected from unauthorized access, corruption, or revision. Peer Review of Influential Information. When using scientific information, including third-party data or models, ensure compliance with the requirements of OMB’s Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. [2] When conducting peer review, SLOs & HoCs will ask reviewers to evaluate the objectivity of the underlying data and the sensitivity of the agency’s conclusions to analytic assumptions. When influential information that has been peer reviewed changes significantly (e.g., as a result of the peer reviewer comments, additional agency analysis, or further consideration) the SLO & HoC will conduct a second peer review. Information Protection. While prioritizing increased access to data and analytical frameworks used to generate information, ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, and Department policy requirements for protections of data security, privacy and confidentiality, proprietary data, and the confidentiality of business, law enforcement, and national security information. Ensure that all interests in privacy and confidentiality are protected, and any disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) takes place pursuant to applicable statutory, regulatory, and Department policy requirements. Any questions relating to appropriate disclosure of PII should be coordinated with the Department’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy, the Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer (CPCLO), consistent with DOJ policy. Options for Wider Access. Explore methods that provide wider access to datasets while reducing the risk of improper disclosures of PII. Tiered access [3] offers promising ways to make data widely available while applying protections for security, privacy, confidentiality, and ensuring appropriate access and use. Statistical Information. Engage in statistical activities [4] that are transparent and based on sound statistical methods. Transparency is a broad concept, which can include a clear description of the methods, data sources, assumptions, outcomes, limitations, and related information to permit a data user to understand how the statistical information product was designed or produced. Sound statistical activities and methods generate information (data and analysis) for a statistical purpose [5] that is accurate, reliable, and unbiased. Procedures to promote sound statistical activities and methods will cover the planning of statistical data systems, the collection of statistical data, and the processing of statistical data (including analysis). Transparency refers to a clear description of the methods, data sources, assumptions, outcomes, limitations, and related information to permit a data user to understand how the statistical information was designed or produced. Scientific Information . Ensure documented methods used on the same data set achieve consistent results. Communicate transparently by “including a clear explication of underlying assumptions; accurate contextualization of uncertainties; and a description of the probabilities associate with both optimistic and pessimistic projections, including best-case and worst-case scenarios.” [6] Program, Regulatory and Administrative Information. Establish procedures for clearly documenting and communicating the quality of program, regulatory, or administrative information that has potential for secondary use (aka secondary analysis), or other use. For questions relating to authorized or unauthorized secondary uses or analysis of information that includes PII, SLOs and HoCs should coordinate with Senior Component Officials for Privacy, subject to approval by the CPLO, in order to ensure privacy requirements are met, and risks are managed. Program, Regulatory and Administrative Information. Establish procedures for clearly documenting and communicating the quality of program, regulatory, or administrative information that has potential for authorized secondary use, (aka secondary analysis). For secondary analysis that includes PII, components should coordinate with the Senior Component Officials for Privacy, subject to approval by the CPCLO, to mitigate risks to individual privacy. Non-Government Information. When using non-government sources [7] to create influential information that represents SLO & HoC views, communicate to the public sufficient information on the characteristics of the data and analysis, including its scope, generation protocols, and any other information necessary to allow the public to reproduce the SLO & HoC’s conclusions. Cross Agency Information. When making information originally collected or developed by other Federal agencies available to the public in a cross-agency dissemination, clearly communicate to the public the quality of the information contributed by DOJ. Information Aggregation. Account for the “mosaic effect” of information aggregation, which occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual but when combined with other available information could pose such a risk.

Pagtatatuwa ng Pananagutan at Pag-endorso Habang ang Departamento ay nagsisikap na gawin ang impormasyon sa website na ito bilang napapanahon at tumpak hangga’t maaari, ang Departamento ay hindi gumagawa ng mga pahayag, pangako, o garantiya tungkol sa katumpakan, pagkakumpleto, o kasapatan ng mga nilalaman ng site na ito, at hayagang itinatanggi ang pananagutan para sa mga pagkakamali at pagtanggal sa mga nilalaman ng site na ito.

Binago Abril 16, 2024 Mga Legal na Patakaran at Pagtatatuwa Mga Legal na Patakaran at Pagtatatuwa Ibahagi  Facebook X LinkedIn Email English | | العربية | | 简体字 | | 繁體中文 | | Français | | 한국어 | | Português | | Pусский | | Español | | Tiếng Việt | | Salamat sa pagbisita sa website ng Department of Justice. Nasa ibaba ang mga legal na patakaran at pagtatatuwa para sa mga gumagamit ng site na ito. Ang mga patakaran at pagtatatuwa na ito ay nalalapat lamang sa site ng Department of Justice. Samakatuwid, kapag nag-link ka sa ibang site, napapailalim ka sa mga patakaran ng bagong site. Mga Link sa Ibang Mga Website Pag-Link sa Website ng DOJ Estado ng Copyright (karapatang magpalathala) at Sitasyon Paggamit ng mga Selyo ng DOJ at Mga Logo Mga Alituntunin ng Kalidad ng Impormasyon Pagtatatuwa ng Pananagutan at Pag-endorso Mga Link sa Ibang Mga Website Ang impormasyon na pino-post sa website ng Department of Justice ay kinabibilangan ng mga hypertext (text na may link sa ibang mga text) na link o mga payo sa impormasyong nilikha at pinanatili ng ibang mga pampubliko at/o pribadong organisasyon. Binibigay ng Department of Justice ang mga link at payo na ito para lamang sa iyong impormasyon at kaginhawaan. Kapag pumili ka ng link sa isang website sa labas, napapailalim ka sa mga patakaran sa pagkapribado, copyright, seguridad, at kalidad ng impormasyon sa website na iyon. Ang Department of Justice ay: HINDI kinokontrol o ginagarantiya ang katumpakan, legalidad, kaugnayan, pagiging napapanahon, o pagkakumpleto ng impormasyon na nilalaman sa isang naka-link na website; HINDI nag-eendorso sa mga naka-link na website, sa mga pananaw na kanilang ipinahayag, o sa mga produkto/serbisyo na kanilang inaalok; HINDI magpapahintulot sa paggamit ng mga naka-copyright na materyales na nilalaman sa naka-link na website; HINDI responsible para sa mga transmisyon na natatanggap ng mga gumagamit mula sa mga naka-link na website; HINDI ginagarantiya na sumusunod ang mga website sa labas sa mga kinakailangan sa pag-access ng Seksyon 508 ng Rehabilitation Act (batas na pangserbisyo sa mga may kapansanan). Ang mga link sa ibang pampamahalaan at hindi pampamahalaan na mga site ay karaniwang lilitaw kasama ang icon (maliit na grapikong simbolo ng programa) ng “panlabas na link” upang ipahiwatig na aalis ka sa website ng Department of Justice kapag pinindot mo ang link. Kapag makakita ka ng link na hindi gumagana mangyaring makipag-ugnayan sa Department of Justice Webmaster (dalubhasa sa web). Pag-link sa Website ng DOJ Pinahihintulutan ang mga link sa website ng Department of Justice website. Ang paggamit ng mga selyo ng Department of Justice, gayunpaman, ay protektado at nangangailangan ng paunang nakasulat na pahintulot tulad ng inilarawan sa ibaba. Ang katotohanan na ang isang website ay nagli-link sa site ng Department of Justice ay hindi nagpapahiwatig na ang Departamento ay may pananagutan sa nilalaman ng site na iyon, at lalong hindi ito nagpapahiwatig ng pag-eendorso sa site na iyon ng Departamento. Estado ng Copyright at Sitasyon Maliban kung iba ang ipinahiwatig, ang impormasyon sa mga website ng Department of Justice ay nasa pampublikong domain at maaaring kopyahin at ipamahagi na walang permiso. Ang sitasyon ng Department of Justice bilang pinagmulan ng impormasyon ay pinahahalagahan, kung naaangkop. Gayunpaman, ang paggamit ng anumang selyo ng Department of Justice ay protektado at nangangailangan ng paunang pahintulot, tulad ng inilarawan sa ibaba. Kung ang pinagmulan maliban sa Department of Justice o ibang ahensya ng federal na pamahalaan ay ipinahiwatig sa isang larawan, grapiko, o ibang materyal, ang permiso para kopyahin ang mga materyales na ito ay dapat makuha sa orihinal na pinagmulan. Paalala lang na ang ilang mga larawan, mga grapiko at ibang mga materyales na ginagamit sa website na ito ay naka-copyright. Para sa impormasyon sa mga materyales na nabuo ng mga panglabas na entidad gamit ang pondo ng Department of Justice, mangyaring sumangguni sa mga patakaran ng indibidwal na bahagi. Ang paunawa sa copyright na ito ay nauukol lamang sa website ng Department of Justice. Paggamit ng Mga Selyo ng Department of Justice at mga Bahagi, Mga Logo, Ibang Opisyal na Sagisag, Mga Pangalan at Inisyal Ang mga selyo ng Department of Justice, mga logo at ibang opisyal na sagisag ay hindi maaaring gamitin o kopyahin nang walang nakasulat na pahintulot. Ang mga kahilingan para sa pahintulot na gumamit o kopyahin ng anumang selyo, logo, o ibang opisyal na sagisag ng isang bahagi ng Department of Justice ay isasangguni sa mga pinuno ng kaugnay na bahagi. Ang mga kahilingan para sa pahintulot na gumamit o kopyahin ang anumang selyo ng Departamento o ibang opisyal na sagisag ay isasangguni sa Assistant Attorney General (pangalawang pangkalahatang abogado) para sa Pamamahala. Ang pahintulot sa paggamit o para kopyahan ang mga selyo, mga logo o ibang opisyal na sagisag ng Departamento ay ipinagkaloob depende sa bawat kaso at nagsasangkot ng pagsasaalang-alang ng maraming nauugnay na mga salik, kasama: ang gastos o benepisyo sa Departamento o sa pamahalaang nagkakaloob sa kahilingan; ang hindi sinasadyang kalabasan ng pag-eendorso o pagpapatunay ng Departamento; ang potensyal para sa maling paggamit; ang epekto sa seguridad ng Departamento; ang kalabasan ng reputasyon sa paggamit; at ang lawak ng kontrol ng Departamento sa sukdulang paggamit at distribusyon ng anumang produkto (mga) o publikasyon(mga) dala ang opisyal na sagisag ng Departamento. Ang paggamit ng mga pangalan o mga inisyal ng Federal Bureau of Investigation (federal na kawanihan para sa nag-iimbestiga), ng Drug Enforcement Administration (ahensya sa pagpapatupad ng batas ng droga), at ng United States Marshals Service (sangay na nagpapatupad ng mga federal na batas) ay pinamamahalaan ng 18 U.S.C. sec. 709, na nagbabawal sa kanilang hindi awtorisadong paggamit sa paraang kinakalkula upang maihatid ang impresyon na ang paggamit na iyon ay inaaprubahan, iniindorso, o pinahihintulutan ng bahagi na iyon,  maliban kung ang nakasulat na pahintulot ay natanggap mula sa pinuno ng kaukulang bahagi. Mga Alituntunin ng Kalidad ng Impormasyon Ang Department of Justice ay naglabas ng mga alituntunin upang makatulong na matiyak ang kalidad, kawalang-kinikilingan, pagiging kapaki-pakinabang at integridad ng impormasyong ipinapalaganap nito sa publiko, kasama ang impormasyong ibinigay sa website na ito. Ang mga kasanayan at pamamaraan ng kalidad ng impormasyon ng Departamento ay makikita sa Pahina ng Kalidad ng Impormasyon ng DOJ . Kasama sa mga alituntunin ng kalidad ng impormasyon ng Departamento ay ang mga pamamaraan para humiling ng pagwawasto ng ipinakalat na impormasyon.

Although application requirements vary, offices typically request a resume, cover letter, and law school transcript. Most offices have early application deadlines and interested law students should plan to apply at least four to five months in advance. Find Volunteer Internship Opportunities How Many Volunteer Opportunities Are There? Each year, over 1,800 volunteer legal interns serve in Justice components and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices throughout the country, during both the academic year and summer. Where Are the Volunteer Opportunities Located? Justice has a presence in almost every major city in the country. There are 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and 89 field offices of the U.S. Trustee Program throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, and more than 60 Immigration Courts in more than 30 states and U.S. territories. Some organizations only offer employment opportunities in Washington, D.C. Other organizations, such as the Antitrust Division, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Environment and Natural Resources Division, have field offices in various cities across the country. Contact information for each U.S. Attorney’s Office is at https://www.justice.gov/usao/find-your-united-states-attorney . More information about Department field office locations is available on the DOJ Offices by State Chart . Who is Eligible for Volunteer Legal Intern Positions? Any law student enrolled at least half-time, and who has completed at least one semester of law school is eligible to apply for volunteer internship positions at any time. First-year law students who have not completed their first semester may apply for volunteer internships after December 1. Part-time law students and joint-degree candidates may also apply for volunteer internship positions. Law school graduation terminates eligibility for volunteer positions except for graduate law students who are enrolled at least half time and not practicing law. Is Course Credit or a Monetary Stipend Available Through My School? Volunteer legal internships may qualify either for course credit or as part of a law school’s work-study program. In addition, some schools sponsor public interest fellowships or other programs where legal interns receive a stipend for public interest work. Interested students should contact their law school for specific information and requirements. Is it Possible to Serve More Than One Volunteer Internship? Working at the Department requires access to DOJ information, DOJ IT systems, and DOJ facilities. Security regulations permit short term access for not more than six months without requiring a background investigation (BI). If one internship or multiple internships within a twelve-month period last more than six months in total, a background investigation is required. In some cases, organizations sponsoring legal interns may not be in a position to justify the time and cost of the BI process in these short-term employment situations. If you have served in a prior DOJ internship/externship and are considering a second DOJ internship within 12 months of the start of the first internship, and the total time spent in DOJ internships would be more than 6 months, we encourage you to raise this issue with the hiring component prior to accepting an offer.

Search Attorney Vacancies & Volunteer Legal Internships Law Students Volunteer Legal Internships Summer Law Intern Program Eligibility Participating Components Entry-Level Attorneys Eligibility Participating Components Experienced Attorneys Current Attorney Vacancies Summer Law Intern Program Eligibility Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email Applications for the 2025 Summer Law Intern Program (SLIP) will be accepted from current law students who have completed at least one semester of full-time study by the Tuesday, September 3, 2024, application deadline. First-year, first-semester law students are not eligible. In addition, a failing law school grade disqualifies SLIP applicants who would intern prior to law school graduation if listed on the official law school transcript.  The majority of SLIP hires intern the summer following the second year of law school (i.e., via the SLIP-Pathways); however, third-year law students entering judicial clerkships, legal fellowships, Presidential Management Fellowships, or full-time graduate law programs may intern between law school graduation and the start of their clerkship, fellowship, or LL.M. program (i.e., via the SLIP-Law Clerk). Law students graduating in winter 2024 through spring 2025 who are applying for, but have not yet accepted clerkships/fellowships, should apply to the Honors Program and transfer to the SLIP Law Clerk upon accepting an offer.  Applicants are not required to attend an ABA accredited law school. The SLIP-Pathways is the hiring program for pre-law school graduation internships. The SLIP-Law Clerk offers graduating law students the opportunity to work for DOJ between law school graduation and the start of an Honors Program eligibility preserving activity . Check Your Eligibility To determine whether you are eligible to apply for the for the 2025 Summer Law Intern Program select the link that best describes your current law school status. Full-time law student (J.D. or equivalent only) Part-time law student (J.D. or equivalent only) Law students graduating in the 2024-2025 academic year Joint Degree law student (e.g., J.D. and LL.M. or J.D. and Masters Degree) Ineligibility Applicants must be current students enrolled and seeking a degree in a qualifying educational institution on a half- to full-time basis and be able to meet the definition of a student throughout the duration of their appointments. Full-time law students: You are eligible if you are currently attending law school and have completed at least one full semester of law school by the application deadline. Part-time law students: You are eligible if you are currently attending law school and have completed the equivalent of one semester of full-time law school by the application deadline. Law Students Graduating in the 2024-2025 academic year: You are eligible to apply to the SLIP-Law Clerk program if you will graduate from law school between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025 and, within 9 months of law school graduation, you will enter a full-time eligibility preserving activity (e.g., a judicial clerkship, a legal fellowship, a Presidential Management Fellowship, or an LL.M. program), and you are available to work during summer 2025. Eligibility is restricted to graduating law students who have accepted/formally committed to a full-time Honors Program eligibility-preserving activity (i.e., a judicial clerkship, legal fellowship, or graduate law program) by the application deadline. Joint-degree students who have completed the JD portion of their education are NOT eligible. If you are applying for, but have not yet accepted a clerkship, fellowship, or a graduate law program, your application will be routed to the Attorney General's Honors Program.  If you later accept a clerkship, fellowship, or are accepted into a graduate law program, you may return to your application, add the specific clerkship/fellowship/graduate law program information, and transfer your application to the Summer Law Intern Program. The system will prompt you to select components participating in the SLIP Law-Clerk (participating components differ between Programs). This option remains open until the Department finalizes its Summer Law Intern Program hiring pools, generally in early- to mid-October. J oint-degree law students (J.D./LL.M.; J.D./MBA, etc.) : You are eligible if you are a current joint-degree student who is simultaneously pursuing a J.D. and a graduate law degree (e.g., J.D./LL.M.) or a J.D. and a non-legal graduate degree (e.g., J.D./MBA) who has completed at least one semester of law school by the application deadline.  You do not currently have to be taking law classes (e.g., the current or future semester may be study directed toward the second graduate degree); however, you must be actively pursuing both degrees. If you will complete academic requirements for both degrees, including a thesis, if required, and graduate from both programs between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025, please see the comments for Law Students Graduating in the 2024-2025 academic year, above. Ineligibility: First year, first semester law students are not eligible. Students attending an educational institution that is not accredited by an agency recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education (such as the American Bar Association (ABA), the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)), are ineligible. If you are unsure whether your law school qualifies, consult with your Career Services office, registrar, or review accreditation information on your law school’s website. This restriction does not apply to SLIP-Law Clerk applicants (graduating law students seeking internships prior to the start of an eligibility preserving activity). Individuals who are not enrolled (or will not be deemed enrolled) at their school (e.g., on a leave of absence) during the internship appointment.  Normal interims between semesters do not result in ineligibility. Individuals who are federal government employees or on active military duty during the internship period are not eligible to be hired via the SLIP. The SLIP is a compensated excepted service hiring program; current federal government employees or active duty military should consider applying for volunteer intern positions with a view toward negotiating a detail or leave of absence with their current employer.

Eligibility is restricted to graduating law students who have accepted/formally committed to a full-time Honors Program eligibility-preserving activity (i.e., a judicial clerkship, legal fellowship, or graduate law program) by the application deadline. Joint-degree students who have completed the JD portion of their education are NOT eligible. If you are applying for, but have not yet accepted a clerkship, fellowship, or a graduate law program, your application will be routed to the Attorney General's Honors Program.  If you later accept a clerkship, fellowship, or are accepted into a graduate law program, you may return to your application, add the specific clerkship/fellowship/graduate law program information, and transfer your application to the Summer Law Intern Program. The system will prompt you to select components participating in the SLIP Law-Clerk (participating components differ between Programs). This option remains open until the Department finalizes its Summer Law Intern Program hiring pools, generally in early- to mid-October.  J oint-degree law students (J.D./LL.M.; J.D./MBA, etc.) : You are eligible if you are a current joint-degree student who is simultaneously pursuing a J.D. and a graduate law degree (e.g., J.D./LL.M.) or a J.D. and a non-legal graduate degree (e.g., J.D./MBA) who has completed at least one semester of law school by the application deadline.  You do not currently have to be taking law classes (e.g., the current or future semester may be study directed toward the second graduate degree); however, you must be actively pursuing both degrees. If you will complete academic requirements for both degrees, including a thesis, if required, and graduate from both programs between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025, please see the comments for Law Students Graduating in the 2024-2025 academic year, above.  Ineligibility: First year, first semester law students are not eligible. Students attending an educational institution that is not accredited by an agency recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education (such as the American Bar Association (ABA), the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)), are ineligible. If you are unsure whether your law school qualifies, consult with your Career Services office, registrar, or review accreditation information on your law school’s website. This restriction does not apply to SLIP-Law Clerk applicants (graduating law students seeking internships prior to the start of an eligibility preserving activity). Individuals who are not enrolled (or will not be deemed enrolled) at their school (e.g., on a leave of absence) during the internship appointment.  Normal interims between semesters do not result in ineligibility. Individuals who are federal government employees or on active military duty during the internship period are not eligible to be hired via the SLIP. The SLIP is a compensated excepted service hiring program; current federal government employees or active duty military should consider applying for volunteer intern positions with a view toward negotiating a detail or leave of absence with their current employer.
