He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record (first among NASA astronauts) and having the fifth-longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. López-Alegría commanded Axiom-1 , the first ever all-private team of commercial astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which launched on April 8, 2022, and spent just over 17 days in Earth's orbit. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Background [ edit ] [ edit ] Son of a Spanish father and an American mother, López-Alegría was born in Madrid , Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California . After graduating from Mission Viejo High School , [ 4 ] López-Alegría joined the United States Navy , where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy , and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School . Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his aviation experience in the Navy was as an instructor pilot in Training Squadron 2 (VT-2) at Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Pensacola, Florida, at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 ( VQ-2 ) in Rota, Spain , and the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River , Maryland . He was the first EP-3E pilot to be selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School 's Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian. [ ] His son Nicolas starred alongside López-Alegría in 2006 in Mira La Luna (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, Son And Moon , was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin , Sunita Williams , and him. Mission record [ edit ] [ edit ] López-Alegría's first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA 's International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff , flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft. [ 5 ] [ ] López-Alegría served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. [ 6 ] [ ] On September 20, 2006, López-Alegría docked with the ISS as commander of Expedition 14 , having taken off from Baikonur , Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9 . On Expedition 14 , he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007, he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth. López-Alegría holds the all-time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross , had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. López-Alegría is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia's Anatoly Solovyev . On April 2, 2007, López-Alegría set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days [ 7 ] (the longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov , who spent 438 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995).

He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record (first among NASA astronauts) and having the fifth-longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. López-Alegría commanded Axiom-1 , the first ever all-private team of commercial astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which launched on April 8, 2022, and spent just over 17 days in Earth's orbit. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Background [ edit ] [ edit ] Son of a Spanish father and an American mother, López-Alegría was born in Madrid , Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California . After graduating from Mission Viejo High School , [ 4 ] López-Alegría joined the United States Navy , where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy , and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School . Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his aviation experience in the Navy was as an instructor pilot in Training Squadron 2 (VT-2) at Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Pensacola, Florida, at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 ( VQ-2 ) in Rota, Spain , and the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River , Maryland . He was the first EP-3E pilot to be selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School 's Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian. [ ] His son Nicolas starred alongside López-Alegría in 2006 in Mira La Luna (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, Son And Moon , was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin , Sunita Williams , and him. Mission record [ edit ] [ edit ] López-Alegría's first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA 's International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff , flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft. [ 5 ] [ ] López-Alegría served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. [ 6 ] [ ] On September 20, 2006, López-Alegría docked with the ISS as commander of Expedition 14 , having taken off from Baikonur , Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9 . On Expedition 14 , he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007, he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth. López-Alegría holds the all-time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross , had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. López-Alegría is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia's Anatoly Solovyev . On April 2, 2007, López-Alegría set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days [ 7 ] (the longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov , who spent 438 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995). [ ] List of EVAs [ edit ] [ edit ] 2000-10-16  7:07 hours STS-92 ,  EVA 2 2000-10-18  6:56 hours  STS-92,  EVA 4 2002-11-26  6:45 hours STS-113 , EVA 1 2002-11-28  6:10 hours  STS-113, EVA 2 2002-11-30  7:00 hours  STS-113, EVA 3 2006-11-22  7:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14 , EVA 1 2007-01-31  7:55 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 2 2007-02-04  7:11 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 3 2007-02-07  6:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 4 2007-02-22  6:18 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 5 At the end of his ISS mission, he commanded the longest flight by a Soyuz spacecraft, making Expedition 14 the longest expedition thus far. López-Alegría broke the record for longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. [ 8 ] [ ] Post-NASA career [ edit ] [ edit ] López-Alegría retired from NASA on March 12, 2012 [ 9 ] and served as the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation through the end of 2014.
López-Alegría is an independent consultant to traditional and commercial space companies, serves on several advisory boards and committees to public and private organizations, and is engaged in public speaking domestically and internationally. He is based in Washington, DC. [ ] In 2017 López-Alegría joined Axiom Space as director of Business Development. [ 10 ] He flew in space again in 2022 as commander of Axiom Mission 1 , the first Axiom Space Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] López-Alegría was the commander of Axiom Mission 3 , which launched on 18 January 2024.

[ 3 ] These teams of combat divers are trained in mine-countermeasures, search and recovery and underwater explosives as a war time role. During peace time they are tasked also with assisting dry docking, underwater welding/cutting/repairs, and their continual role in assisting arms of service from other nations ( Lesotho , Tanzania ) and in crime fighting in collaboration with the police. [ ] Training [ edit ] [ edit ] Training is conducted at the Diving school at SAS Simonsberg, which was established on 1 April 1957 after the signing of the Simonstown Agreement .

"Captain" is the nickname which is widely applied to Billy Deans, however he is a US Coast Guard -rated captain up to 100 tons. [ citation needed ] citation needed Deans is a former member of the board of directors of International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). He was an instructor for the United States Army Corps of Engineers , and taught Special forces divers for the United States Army and the United States Navy . He is also a Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) and National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) recreational diving instructor. [ citation needed ] citation needed In Kevin McMurray's book, Deep Descent , he refers to an unspecified third party publication describing Billy Deans as "the world's best diver". [ 1 ] [ ] Billy Deans was one of the early pioneers in the use of trimix for deep diving . During the exploration of U-869 chronicled in the best selling book, Shadow Divers , John Chatterton and Richie Kohler sought instruction from Billy Deans in the use of trimix (which had, until then, largely been restricted to cave exploration diving in Florida ). These presaged a number of North Eastern wreck divers to seek trimix training from Billy Deans, leading to its popularity as a deep diving breathing gas. [ 2 ] [ ] Billy Deans has been involved in a number of high-profile shipwreck expeditions over the years, including Gary Gentile 's expedition to the USS Monitor , various exploration dives on the SS Andrea Doria , [ 3 ] the USS Wilkes-Barre and U-2513 . In late 1993, Billy Deans served as Dive Operations Officer for an expedition recovering treasure and artifacts from a Spanish brigantine which sank in the Gulf of Mexico off New Orleans . [ ] Billy Deans ran a dive shop (known as Key West Diver) in Key West, FL for many years prior to retiring from diving in 1998. [ citation needed ] citation needed He qualified as an ICU nurse .

Dive boats may be propelled by wind or muscle power, but are usually powered by internal combustion engines. Some features, like convenient access from the water, are common to all dive boats, while others depend on the specific application or region where they are used. The vessel may be extensively modified to make it fit for purpose, or may be used without much adaptation if it is already usable. Dive boats may simply transport divers and their equipment to and from the dive site for a single dive, or may provide longer term support and shelter for day trips or periods of several consecutive days. [ 1 ] Deployment of divers may be while moored , at anchor , or under way , (also known as live-boating or live-boat diving). There are a range of specialised procedures for boat diving, which include water entry and exit, avoiding injury by the dive boat, and keeping the dive boat crew aware of the location of the divers in the water. [ ] live-boating There are also procedures used by the boat crew, to avoid injuring the divers in the water, keeping track of where they are during a dive, recalling the divers in an emergency, and ensuring that none are left behind. Purpose [ edit ] [ edit ] The dive boat provides a means of transport to and from dive sites which may be too far or inconvenient for shore access. This is the case with the majority of recreational dive sites. It can also provide a base of operations where the divers can shelter, rest, store and change gear, socialise with other divers, eat and sleep between dives. They can provide enhanced safety, comfort and convenience, and provide guided access to sites of particular interest, but introduce their own set of hazards. They can also provide access to diving procedures which may be difficult, dangerous or impossible from the shore. [ 2 ] [ ] Types of dive boat [ edit ] [ edit ] The usual classification of recreational dive boats based on operational parameters includes: [ 3 ] [ ] basic dive boats day boats liveaboards Some overlap of function is possible.
Dive boats may be privately owned and operated, or run as a commercial business (generally known as charter boats). [ 2 ] [ ] The structure, layout and size of a dive boat for any given application may vary considerably according to regional requirements and traditions, and convenience. Basic dive boats [ edit ] [ edit ] These are usually open boats used for short distance, or short duration, trips to dive sites, usually for a single dive or sometimes for a "two tank" trip, either with both dives at the same site, or with the second dive on the way back, or a short distance from the first. They generally have no amenities other than seating and stowage for dive gear, and the divers are usually exposed to wind, spray and sun during the trip. It is common for divers to kit up in their dive suits before boarding, for protection from the weather. It is unusual for the operator to provide refreshments other than bottled drinking water and an after-dive candy. [ citation needed ] citation needed Rigid-hulled inflatable boat [ edit ] [ edit ] Divers only spend a few hours at a time on these fast but exposed boats. The boats are usually relatively small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for private use, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat safety gear, lifejackets and first aid oxygen administration equipment. [ 1 ] [ ] Space in the boat is limited, and divers generally travel and kit up while sitting on the tubes opposite a central cylinder rack where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, and return to the boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have ladders which hook over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively wet and uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that they get the diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches. [ citation needed ] citation needed Open rigid hulled boats [ edit ] [ edit ] These serve a similar function to the Rigid-hulled inflatable boats, but do not have inflatable tubes. They are more durable, but usually heavier for the same load capacity. In Australia and New Zealand the light aluminium " tinnie " is often used as a dive boat. These boats are usually less stable than the equivalent inflatable and are not as easy to climb back on board, but are light, durable and economical. Kayaks and canoes are occasionally used as dive boats for one or two divers, and are portable and paddled by the occupants. [ 4 ] [ ] Decked rigid hulled boats [ edit ] [ edit ] Flush decked boats with transom boarding arrangements are commonly used in areas with generally pleasant weather and sea conditions. The flush deck with seating and storage along the sides leaves the centre of the deck open for movement to and from the stern. Gates in the handrails amidships may be provided to get divers into the water more quickly, and an awning may be provided for protection from the sun. Inflatable boats [ edit ] [ edit ] These are usually relatively small and used only for short distances with a small number of divers. They are relatively uncomfortable, and not usually very fast, but are stable for their size and can be deflated, folded, and transported in a car or utility vehicle. [ citation needed ] citation needed Day boat [ edit ] [ edit ] These boats are usually made of rigid materials - such as glass reinforced resin, plywood or aluminium. Day boats are generally relatively large: typically, between 60 and 90 feet (18 and 27 m) in length, as they must provide some comfort for the passengers for several hours. Many day boats are used for scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as "liveaboard" boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather and is likely to have various facilities such as a toilet (called the "head") and a small kitchen (called a "galley"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing to be out in the open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. [ citation needed ] citation needed The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the boat, and return on board using a ladder or a lift. In some cases a smaller "tender" is used to carry divers to and from less accessible sites, and to rescue divers who are in difficulty or who drift away from the boat. [ citation needed ] citation needed Liveaboard [ edit ] [ edit ] On these commercially operated boats, the divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat. [ 2 ] In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] The divers enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical lift platform. [ 2 ] Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat. [ citation needed ] [ ] citation needed Liveaboards used on the West Coast of Thailand and in the Red Sea tend to be up to 100 feet (30 m) long and have: [ citation needed ] citation needed The engine and stores compartments. The lower deck, which is mostly cabins for the passengers, usually two passengers per cabin. At the stern, a diving platform with diving ladders. The main deck, with dining/social room, crew cabins, the bridge , and open space for preparation and storage of dive gear. One or two superstructure decks. The size of a liveaboard can vary considerably, based mainly on the number of passengers carried, the quality of accommodations provided, special equipment carried, and legal constraints for registration. Diving support vessels [ edit ] [ edit ] A diving support vessel is a ship that is used as a floating base for professional diving projects. [ 6 ] They are not generally classified as dive boats but share the basic purpose of transporting divers and giving them access to the water at the dive site . Basic requirements are the ability to keep station accurately and reliably throughout a diving operation, often in close proximity to drilling or production platforms, for positioning to degrade slowly enough in deteriorating conditions to recover divers without excessive risk, and to carry the necessary support equipment for the mode of diving to be used. [ ] Recent offshore diving support vessels tend to be dynamically positioned (DP) and often have additional functions. DP makes a wider range of operations possible, but the platform presents some inherent hazards, particularly the thrusters , making launch and recovery by diving bell widespread. DSVs for inshore operations tend to be much smaller, and may operate while moored for shallow work. Live-boat operations are considered unacceptably hazardous for surface supplied diving unless a stage or bell is used to keep the divers' umbilicals clear of the vessel's thrusters . Others [ edit ] [ edit ] Boats intended for other purposes can usually be used as dive platforms provided that there is reasonably convenient access to the water and enough space to carry the necessary equipment. Auxiliary sailing yachts  and motor yachts are often used by their owners as dive boats, and catamarans can be particularly amenable to this function as they often have spacious decks and stern boarding facilities with swim ladders. Dive boat features [ edit ] [ edit ] Features that make a boat suitable for use by divers are: Sufficient space and stability to carry the divers and their equipment. [ 7 ] : 12–11 [ ] : 12–11 Safe stowage for equipment during transit. Facilities for the divers to enter the water from the boat and board the boat from in the water. [ 7 ] : 12–11 [ ] : 12–11 Basic marine safety equipment for the class of vessel will be required by regional or national legislation, and diving specific safety equipment may also be carried as  required by legislation or the diver certification agency to which the boat operator is affiliated. This will usually include: Basic marine safety equipment: marine VHF radio small craft emergency equipment - life jackets , flares , fire extinguishers and other equipment according to the size and operating range of the boat. Diving safety equipment: oxygen first aid equipment. [ 1 ] [ ] diving first aid equipment . [ 8 ] [ ] diving shot , line, and buoy. [ 1 ] [ ] a signal flag to indicate that divers are in the water. [ 1 ] [ ] where necessary, equipment to bring an incapacitated diver on board. On larger boats additional diving support facilities may also be present: high pressure diving air compressor gas blending panel recompression chamber chase boat , or tender , to recover divers who surface away from the anchored vessel Access facilities [ edit ] [ edit ] If the freeboard of the boat is too high for the divers to climb back on board unaided, a ladder or other aid must be provided. Boarding aids range in cost, complexity, safety, and ease of use, from a boarding stirrup or a rope ladder, through rigid ladders and stairs with handrails, christmas tree ladders which allow the diver to climb while wearing fins, to temporary and fixed stern dive platforms, lifting platforms, diver lifts, and passerelles . [ 7 ] : 12–13 [ ] : 12–13 Diver lifts [ edit ] [ edit ] A diver lift is a platform which is lowered into the water on which the diver stands while being lifted up to deck level. The lift mechanism constrains sideways motions of the platform, and has sufficient hand-holds for the diver to stand securely during lifting. A lift may also be used to lower a diver into the water. In most cases the lift will be suitable for transporting a fully kitted diver in a standing position, but in special cases seating may be provided. It differs from a diving stage or basket, which is lowered to diving depth, as a lift generally can only be lowered deep enough to stand up after swimming over the platform, which for most divers will be between 1 and 1.5 metres (3.3 and 4.9 ft). [ 9 ] The lifting platform should have enough space to stand wearing fins, and there should be suitable handholds to allow the diver to be stable during lifting and lowering with a low risk of getting equipment or body parts in pinch points. The space allowed for walking between platform and boat should take into account the equipment likely to be carried by the diver, such as side mounted cylinders. [ ] Dive boat operations [ edit ] [ edit ] Procedures for diving from a boat vary depending on the boat, the diving equipment, the dive site and the dive plan. [ 10 ] [ ] Stowage of dive gear [ edit ] [ edit ] Trim and stability of small boats can be significantly influenced by where and how the dive gear is stowed.
When transiting a surf line, or in other rough sea conditions, the movement of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks to stow the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks to stow other heavy equipment. [ 2 ] Larger vessels, particularly liveaboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive. [ ] Deployment of divers [ edit ] [ edit ] Divers will usually enter the water with positive buoyancy, as this allows them to make final surface checks, signal to the boat that they are OK and co-ordinate descent with a buddy, but there are occasions when negative buoyancy entries are chosen to avoid excessive drift in a strong current, in which case all pre-dive checks must be done on the boat, the buoyancy compensator, and where applicable, the dry-suit emptied of gas, and the breathing apparatus function thoroughly checked before entering the water. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The risk of injury if there is an equipment problem is greater for negative entry, particularly with breathing gas failures. [ ] [ ] Water entry [ edit ] [ edit ] Several techniques are used for water entry from boats, depending on the layout of the vessel, particularly the freeboard at the entry points. Large dive boats often have a permanent or folding platform at the stern just above the water, intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient for divers. Such platforms will usually be provided with steps or ladders from the deck, and folding ladders into the water. Backward roll : The diver sits on the gunwale or RHIB tube facing into the boat, and falls in backwards. Suitable for open boats with low sides. [ 3 ] [ 10 ] : 13–6 Backward roll [ ] [ ] : 13–6 Forward roll is suitable for boats with low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing. [ 3 ] Forward roll [ ] Stride entry is suitable for boats with low or moderately low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point. [ 3 ] Stride entry [ ] Vertical drop is suitable for boats with moderate to high deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point. [ 13 ] : 249 Vertical drop [ ] : 249 Silent entry , suitable for boat with very low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing. [ 13 ] : 251 Silent entry [ ] : 251 Ladder entry may be used where there is a ladder into the water. Ladders may be fixed, folding or portable, and may be designed for use with swimfins. Lifting platform entry: The diver/s stand on a platform fixed to the boat by the lifting mechanism, and are lowered a short distance into the water. [ 9 ] [ ] Stage launch: The diver/s stand on a platform called a diving stage or basket, which can be lowered by a cable to a considerable distance below the surface. diving stage Monitoring and escorting the divers [ edit ] [ edit ] If there is no current, and the divers are visiting a small site and can surface on the shot-line or anchor line, keeping track is nominally simple if all goes to plan, as they will surface at a predictable position which is marked. This is not always the case, and for some dives they will surface away from the marker even when the plan is followed precisely. In other cases divers will not make it back to the shot-line and have to surface independently. If the dive boat is anchored and the plan is for the divers to ascend on the anchor line, it may be necessary to have a tender or chase boat available to follow and pick up divers surfacing off the mark. [ 14 ] [ ] One system common with recreational divers is for one of the divers in each group to deploy a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB), also known as a decompression buoy , at the end of the dive. This serves to notify the boat that divers are surfacing, and where they are. It also warns other vessels to keep clear of divers in the water. [ 14 ] [ ] A group of divers drift diving together will often follow a dive leader who tows a surface marker buoy (SMB) throughout the dive. This allows the boat to follow the group effectively in most conditions. If any of the divers need to surface early they can ascend on the SMB line, and surface at the buoy, which is where they will be most easily seen by the boat crew. If anyone is separated from the group they can deploy a DSMB to notify the boat that they will be surfacing away from the float. [ 15 ] [ ] Recovery of divers [ edit ] [ edit ] Divers may be picked up by a small tender or the dive boat may have a low enough freeboard for divers to climb over the side unaided, or with a bit of assistance from the crew. In this case it is usual to pass up heavy equipment such as weightbelts , and leave on the fins to help boost the diver out of the water. This is easiest with inflatable boats, particularly if provided with conveniently sited handles or ropes along the sides. [ 3 ] For higher freeboards and easier boarding, mechanical aids may be provided: [ ] Ladders may be provided for boarding from the water. [ 7 ] : 12–11 It is easier to climb a standard ladder or stairs if fins are removed first. [ 16 ] They can be handed up to an attendant on the boat, clipped to the diver's harness, or carried by sliding the fin straps over the forearm. Christmas tree ladders can be climbed with the fins on the feet, and should stand off the side of the boat far enough for the fins to have clearance. [ ] : 12–11 [ ] Stern and side platforms [ 7 ] : 12–13 may be used in conjunction with ladders or low freeboard decks. [ ] : 12–13 Passerelles or gangways are ramps which are lowered at one end to provide a path to walk from the deck to a dock or tender, and can also be used to walk to the water level. Diver lifts are platforms attached to the boat on which the diver stands while being lifted to deck level or lowered a short distance into the water. [ 9 ] [ ] Stages and baskets are platforms which are lowered into and under the water and are hoisted back on board with the diver or divers standing on them. They are not attached to the boat except by the lifting cable. Boarding stirrups can be used on low freeboard boats, particularly rigid hull inflatables. They are straps with a loop, rung or hook at the lower end attached to the side of the boat. The standard versions require a fin to be removed to get the foot into the stirrup, and have a fixed length, which can be awkward to use as the stirrup may be uncomfortably high for a tall person if at the right height for a short person. Adjustable versions allow the diver to clip the loop around the foot with the fin in place, then the loop can be raised to the preferred height after fitting. Open sided rigid "hook" stirrups allow the foot to be positioned on a rigid stirrup without removing the fin. [ 17 ] Stirrup steps have the same ergonomic disadvantages as rope ladders : they swing freely under load. [ ] Adjustable boarding stirrup  Foot loop detail  Fit loop  Push up  Swing onto boat  Boat diving hazards [ edit ] [ edit ] Run down by boat (the dive boat or any other passing by) Cut by propeller (the dive boat or any other passing by) Left behind in the sea after the dive Seasickness Another diver landing on top during entry. This can happen when divers do a group backward roll over the side of a boat, and do not all go in together. Anyone rolling late may land on top of someone already in the water. It can also happen when entries are from the same point and a diver does not ensure that the water is clear to enter. Falling overboard in transit, particularly when crossing a surf line after a beach launch in a boat where the seating is along the sides. Surfacing far away from boat and cannot be found. Surfacing away from an anchored boat and unable to swim back to it against wind or current. Hypothermia and wind chill on open boats in cold or windy weather Sunburn and overheating on open boats in hot weather Special procedures [ edit ] [ edit ] Some boat diving activities require special procedures to reduce risk or enhance the diving experience. Logging in and out [ edit ] [ edit ] The risk of being left behind by the boat can be controlled by logging divers into and out of the water. [ 18 ] If this is done by each diver only for themselves, there is little chance of confusion and error. In other protocols the skipper or divemaster is responsible for ensuring there is a name-list of all divers on board before leaving the shore, and that everyone on the list is back on the boat before leaving the dive site. [ 19 ] [ ] [ ] Use of personal marker [ edit ] [ edit ] Surfacing at the shot-line, group surface marker, or personal marker buoy increases the visibility of a diver, and reduces the risk of not being noticed by a passing vessel. This will reduce the risks both of being run down and of being lost at the surface. [ 20 ] It also provides an additional flotation device in case of fatigue. [ ] Signalling the boat [ edit ] [ edit ] If the boat cannot see a diver at the surface, the diver can use several methods to be more visible, and once seen, can indicate to the boat whether they are in difficulty or not. [ 20 ] [ ] Diving from an anchored boat [ edit ] [ edit ] When using the anchor line to control ascents and descents, a "tag line" (or "lead line") may be used between the anchor line and the stern of the vessel, to allow secure transfer between these points in a current. [ 21 ] A floating "drift line" (also "tag line", "current line" or "trail line") may be streamed from the stern or boarding platform to assist divers who drift astern of the vessel, and for something to hold onto while waiting to use the ladder. They can either hold onto the line and be pulled in by the crew, or pull themselves along the line. The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. [ 2 ] A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the anchor line to guide decompressing divers ascending on the anchor line to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops. [ ] [ ] Live-boating [ edit ] [ edit ] Live-boating is diving from a boat which is not moored. [ 10 ] : 13–7 There are increased risks due to the proximity of the divers to propellers when the engines are running, but there are also safety and convenience advantages to having the boat available to move at immediate notice, particularly in currents, as the boat can follow a group of drift divers, and pick up the divers from where they surface in most cases. Live boating is also used where anchoring is prohibited or impracticable. Live-boating [ ] : 13–7 Decompression stations [ edit ] [ edit ] When a significant amount of decompression is planned by several divers at a site where they can reasonably expect to surface on the shotline , they may consider deploying a decompression trapeze . This keeps the divers together where it is easier to monitor them and provide support for the last part of the dive. [ 22 ] A decompression trapeze can also be dropped by the boat for a group of divers by pre-arranged signal, such as a second decompression buoy at the group. [ ] Drift diving [ edit ] [ edit ] Drift diving occurs when the divers allow themselves to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy , and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is vertical current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. [ 3 ] [ 15 ] Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs , surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem. [ ] [ ] Wreck diving [ edit ] [ edit ] A major consideration of wreck diving is finding the wreck and getting the divers to the wreck with the minimum risk of getting lost.
There are several methods for getting the divers to the wreck. The preferred method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor . A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage is less likely to damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important to get back to the shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as "parachuting in" or "free drop". The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary.  Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions. [ 23 ] When live-boating there are alternative methods for descent, including free drop and descent on the shotline. [ 21 ] [ ] live-boating [ ] An upline (or Jersey upline) may be used to limit drift during ascent. This is a fairly substantial natural fibre rope which is deployed from the bottom using a small lift bag to provide the equivalent of a shotline. The lower end is tied off to the bottom, usually on a wreck, and the diver ascends on the line to avoid being swept away from the site by currents. After reaching the surface, the last diver cuts the line and it sinks back down, Natural fibre is used so the line rots away over a few years. [ 24 ] upline [ ] Towing a diver [ edit ] [ edit ] Occasionally a diver may be towed using a "sled", an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. [ 10 ] : 13–7 The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. [ 25 ] Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver. [ 26 ] [ ] : 13–7 [ ] [ ] Emergency procedures [ edit ] [ edit ] Diver recall [ edit ] [ edit ] There are several ways to recall divers to the surface during a dive. Some are not universally known or immediately obvious, and the chances of them being understood correctly and responded to appropriately are increased if they are specified in the dive briefing. [ 18 ] [ ] Pyrotechnic diver recall devices (Thunderflash) are small explosive devices calibrated to make sufficient noise to alert any divers in the vicinity without significant risk of injury to diver or environment. They have the advantages of being small, compact, and not easily confused with anything else likely to occur during the dive. They  have disadvantages of a limited shelf life, and must be transported, stored, used and disposed of according to manufacturer's instructions and legal constraints. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] A surface marker buoy line may be used to signal to the diver below, either by pre-arranged pull signals, or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and carrying a message. [ 27 ] [ ] Underwater loudspeaker and public address (PA) systems produce either a pre-programmed or microphone input sound signal. [ 29 ] [ ] Revving the boat's engines is a popular but notoriously unreliable method, as few divers can distinguish between the sounds of the engines of their support boat and those of any other roughly similar vessel. Lost diver procedures [ edit ] [ edit ] There are three aspects to lost diver procedure: Lost buddy procedure, which is similar or identical to the procedure when diving from any other platform, until the diver notifies the boat that a diver is missing. Lost diver underwater, and Lost diver on the surface. Generally, since the diver is lost, it is not known whether they are lost underwater or on the surface. Early notification that a diver is missing allows early starting of the search process. If the divers are notified of their expected behaviour during the dive briefing, the chances of timely notification of a problem are improved. [ 18 ] [ ] If a diver has not surfaced or returned to the boat when expected or a diver is reported missing by a buddy or dive leader, the diver is considered to be lost unless they have a surface marker buoy deployed. [ 30 ] However, the presence of a buoy at the surface is no guarantee that it is connected to the diver. [ ] Decompression illness [ edit ] [ edit ] A dive boat will not be carrying a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving support vessel , so treatment would be limited to oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, [ 31 ] first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where the equipment is available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may choose to do in-water recompression . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Operating a dive boat [ edit ] [ edit ] The person in command of a dive boat is generally referred to as the skipper . In most cases the boat is fairly small and will not require many crew members. It is not unusual for the skipper to be the only crew member.
There may be national legislation requiring a certificate of competency or license from the person in command of a dive boat. This will generally depend on whether the boat is operated for profit, how many passengers it is licensed to carry and how far offshore it is licensed to operate.   This section needs expansion .

He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record (first among NASA astronauts) and having the fifth-longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. López-Alegría commanded Axiom-1 , the first ever all-private team of commercial astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which launched on April 8, 2022, and spent just over 17 days in Earth's orbit. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Background [ edit ] [ edit ] Son of a Spanish father and an American mother, López-Alegría was born in Madrid , Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California . After graduating from Mission Viejo High School , [ 4 ] López-Alegría joined the United States Navy , where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy , and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School . Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his aviation experience in the Navy was as an instructor pilot in Training Squadron 2 (VT-2) at Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Pensacola, Florida, at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 ( VQ-2 ) in Rota, Spain , and the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River , Maryland . He was the first EP-3E pilot to be selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School 's Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian. [ ] His son Nicolas starred alongside López-Alegría in 2006 in Mira La Luna (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, Son And Moon , was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin , Sunita Williams , and him. Mission record [ edit ] [ edit ] López-Alegría's first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA 's International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff , flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft. [ 5 ] [ ] López-Alegría served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. [ 6 ] [ ] On September 20, 2006, López-Alegría docked with the ISS as commander of Expedition 14 , having taken off from Baikonur , Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9 . On Expedition 14 , he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007, he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth. López-Alegría holds the all-time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross , had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. López-Alegría is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia's Anatoly Solovyev . On April 2, 2007, López-Alegría set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days [ 7 ] (the longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov , who spent 438 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995). [ ] List of EVAs [ edit ] [ edit ] 2000-10-16  7:07 hours STS-92 ,  EVA 2 2000-10-18  6:56 hours  STS-92,  EVA 4 2002-11-26  6:45 hours STS-113 , EVA 1 2002-11-28  6:10 hours  STS-113, EVA 2 2002-11-30  7:00 hours  STS-113, EVA 3 2006-11-22  7:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14 , EVA 1 2007-01-31  7:55 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 2 2007-02-04  7:11 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 3 2007-02-07  6:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 4 2007-02-22  6:18 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 5 At the end of his ISS mission, he commanded the longest flight by a Soyuz spacecraft, making Expedition 14 the longest expedition thus far. López-Alegría broke the record for longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. [ 8 ] [ ] Post-NASA career [ edit ] [ edit ] López-Alegría retired from NASA on March 12, 2012 [ 9 ] and served as the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation through the end of 2014.
López-Alegría is an independent consultant to traditional and commercial space companies, serves on several advisory boards and committees to public and private organizations, and is engaged in public speaking domestically and internationally. He is based in Washington, DC. [ ] In 2017 López-Alegría joined Axiom Space as director of Business Development. [ 10 ] He flew in space again in 2022 as commander of Axiom Mission 1 , the first Axiom Space Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] López-Alegría was the commander of Axiom Mission 3 , which launched on 18 January 2024.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He has also served as a NASA Undersea Research Team Project Lead and Spaceflight Training Simulation Supervisor at NASA JSC. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Todd is a veteran Aquanaut of 5 missions. In 2001, he commanded the first NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations ( NEEMO ) mission, a joint NASA- NOAA program to study human survival in the Aquarius underwater laboratory in preparation for future space exploration . [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Todd has also spent many years helping to develop the futuristic undersea exploration vessel SeaOrbiter , which was inspired by French architect Jacques Rougerie . [ 8 ] [ ] Education [ edit ] [ edit ] Todd grew up watching the Apollo launches from his beachfront hometown of Cocoa Beach, Florida , where his father was also employed in the space program. It was there, at a young age, that he was immersed in and captivated by both sea and space environments.  Todd graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in geology in 1982.  He has worked in several underwater habitats , piloted many submersibles , and has conducted myriad expeditions on the parallels between living and working in outer space and "inner space". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] NASA career [ edit ] [ edit ] Todd works as a subsea and space operations consultant as well as for Booz Allen at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as the NEEMO, NEEMO NXT and SEATEST Project Manager. [ 9 ] As a Simulation Supervisor in Spaceflight Training, Todd was responsible for developing and executing multi-national simulations used for training astronauts and flight control teams. He has also worked as an Operations Lead at the Mission Control Center in Moscow , Russia . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2000, Todd developed the NASA Undersea Research Team " NEEMO " (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations). This program utilizes the Aquarius laboratory as a research facility for space missions such as long-term space habitation. Todd served as an aquanaut on the 2000 "NASA SEATEST" mission, NASA SEATEST 3 in 2016, SEATEST 4 in 2017, and as the commander of the October 2001 NASA NEEMO 1 mission. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] He subsequently managed the "topside" teams for NASA missions, [ 5 ] and was the Mission Director for NEEMO 7 , [ 10 ] NEEMO 8 [ 11 ] and NEEMO 14 . [ 12 ] As of 2016, Todd remains the project manager for NEEMO thru NEEMO 21. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In June 2012, Todd piloted a DeepWorker 2000 submersible as part of the NEEMO 16 mission. [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Todd was involved in the training for many spaceflights, including the first two flights to build the International Space Station, crew training for the deployment mission of the Italian -made Tethered Satellite System and for the first flight to rendezvous with the Mir Space Station . Earlier in his career, Todd worked as a Space Shuttle systems astronaut instructor for many missions including STS-31 , the flight which deployed the Hubble Space Telescope . Todd also led the international training activities for STS-97 /ISS 4A, which flew in November 2000. [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] Personal [ edit ] [ edit ] Todd's wife, Karen, and their two daughters, Kristen and Kari, reside in Nassau Bay, Texas and Beaver Creek, Colorado. Todd is a Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) Divemaster who has made over 2000 dives. He is also a submersible pilot, an instrument-rated pilot , seaplane pilot and Explorers Club Fellow. Todd is a member of the SeaSpace Symposium and of the advisory board for the International Association for Handicapped Divers . Todd also plays guitar in his rock band , The Rockit Scientists.

( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Underwater vision is the ability to see objects underwater , and this is significantly affected by several factors. Underwater, objects are less visible because of lower levels of natural illumination caused by rapid attenuation of light with distance passed through the water. They are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, also resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with wavelength of the light, and color and turbidity of the water. The vertebrate eye is usually either optimised for underwater vision or air vision, as is the case in the human eye. The visual acuity of the air-optimised eye is severely adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between air and water when immersed in direct contact. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but has the side effect of scale and distance distortion. The diver learns to compensate for these distortions. Artificial illumination is effective to improve illumination at short range. [ 1 ] [ ] Stereoscopic acuity , the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this is affected by the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and associated loss of hand-eye coordination. [ 1 ] At very short range in clear water distance is underestimated, in accordance with magnification due to refraction through the flat lens of the mask, but at greater distances - greater than arm's reach, the distance tends to be overestimated to a degree influenced by turbidity. Both relative and absolute depth perception are reduced underwater. Loss of contrast results in overestimation, and magnification effects account for underestimation at short range. [ 1 ] Divers can to a large extent adapt to these effects over time and with practice. [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Light rays bend when they travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens . The cornea , humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina . The eye of most land animals is adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), effectively eliminating the cornea's focusing properties. When immersed in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they are focused  behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia . [ 2 ] This is largely avoided by having an air space between the water and the cornea, trapped inside the mask or helmet. [ ] Water attenuates light due to absorption [ 2 ] and as light passes through water colour is selectively absorbed by the water. Color absorption is also affected by turbidity of the water and dissolved material. Water preferentially absorbs red light, and to a lesser extent, yellow, green and violet light, so the color that is least absorbed by water is blue light. [ 3 ] Particulates and dissolved materials may absorb different frequencies, and this will affect the color at depth, with results such as the typically green color in many coastal waters, and the dark red-brown color of many freshwater rivers and lakes due to dissolved organic matter. [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Visibility is a term which generally predicts the ability of some human, animal, or instrument to optically detect an object in the given environment, and may be expressed as a measure of the distance at which an object or light can be discerned. [ 4 ] Factors affecting visibility include illumination, length of the light path, particles which cause scattering, dissolved pigments which absorb specific colours,  and salinity and temperature gradients which affect refractive index. [ 5 ] Visibility can be measured in any arbitrary direction, and for various colour targets, but horizontal visibility of a black target reduces the variables and meets the requirements for a straight-forward and robust parameter for underwater visibility. [ 4 ] Instruments are available for field estimates of visibility from the surface, which can inform the dive team on probable complications. [ ] [ ] [ ] Illumination [ edit ] [ edit ] Illumination of underwater environments is limited by the characteristics of the water. Light absorption by water is variable and depends on the temperature of the water and concentration of ions (salinity). Accurate values for the absorbtion coefficient and the temperature and salinity coefficients are available for specific ranges and values of wavelength from 400nm to 14000nm.There are three dominant molrcular vibration modes but the absorption spectrum in liquid water is a continuum. Light scattering is also variable depending on temperature and salinity. [ 6 ] [ ] Natural illumination [ edit ] [ edit ] Natural illumination underwater is mostly sunlight during the day and moonlight during the night in the depth zone near the surface. In deeper water, where this light does not penetrate, light emitted by living organisms constitute most of the natural illumination.   This section needs expansion with:  light emitted by organisms, artificial lighting. You can help by adding to it . ( February 2025 ) ( February 2025 ) February 2025 Artificial illumination [ edit ] [ edit ]  Light absorption and scattering [ edit ] [ edit ] backscatter has a greater effect when from artificial illumination as the light source is more likely to be close to the viewer than for natural light. Evolution of the eye [ edit ] [ edit ] Eyes originated, developed and diversified by natural selection as organs of photosensitivity and vision in living organisms. The eye exemplifies convergent evolution of an organ found in many animal forms . Simple light detection is found in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants and animals. Complex, image-forming eyes have evolved independently several times. [ 7 ] [ ] Types of eye [ edit ] [ edit ] There are several types of eye, comprising simple eyes, with one concave photoreceptive surface, and compound eyes which include a group of individual lenses laid out over a convex surface. Each of these major types has several lesser variations, with about 10 significant types recognised. All of these originated in aquatic organisms, and therefore have, at some stages of their evolution, been adapted primarily for underwater vision. Some lineages took to terrestrial life, and their eyes evolved further in that environment, and of those, a few returned to an amphibious or aquatic lifestyle, with further adaptation in some cases. Photosensitivity [ edit ] [ edit ] Focus [ edit ] [ edit ] Water has a significantly different refractive index to air, and this affects the focusing of the eye. Most animals' eyes are adapted to either underwater or air vision, and do not focus properly when in the other environment. [ citation needed ] citation needed Variations by taxa [ edit ] [ edit ] Invertebrates have a large variety of eye structures. Most, possibly all, originated in an aquatic environment, but some have later adapted to a terrestrial environment, and later re-adapted to an aquatic environment. [ citation needed ] Vertebrates all evolved from a common marine vertebrate ancestor, which already had well developed underwater vision and a specific eye structure, which has been conserved, or in some cases atrophied  in animals living in the lightless cave environment. [ citation needed ] citation needed citation needed Arthropods [ edit ] [ edit ] Most arthropods have at least one of two types of eye: lateral compound eyes, and smaller median ocelli, which are simple eyes. [ 8 ] When both are present, the two eye types are used in concert because each has its own advantage. [ 9 ] Ocelli can detect lower light levels, [ a ] [ 10 ] and have a faster response time, while compound eyes are better at detecting edges and are capable of forming images. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]   This section needs expansion with: Specific to underwater vision. You can help by adding to it . ( March 2025 ) ( March 2025 ) March 2025 Molluscs [ edit ] [ edit ] The molluscs have the widest variety of eye morphologies of any phylum , [ 11 ] and a large degree of variation in their function. Cephalopods such as octopus , squid , and cuttlefish have paired eyes on their heads as complex as those of vertebrates, [ 11 ] while scallops have large numbers of simple eyes along the edges of the shell opening, [ 12 ] and chitons have a dispersed network of tiny eyes over the surface of their shells which may act together as a compound eye. Many gastropods have stalked eyes which can be retracted in the presence of danger. [ 11 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] There are between seven and eleven distinct eye types in molluscs, [ 13 ] of all levels of complexity, from the pit eyes of many gastropods , to the pinhole eyes of the Nautilus , to the lensed eyes of the other cephalopods .  Compound eyes are present in some bivalves, and reflective 'mirrors' have been innovated by other lineages such as scallops . [ 11 ] The eyes of molluscs also span a large range in size, from 20 μm (0.0008 in) to 27 cm (11 in) across. [ 11 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Fish [ edit ] [ edit ] Fish eyes are similar to the eyes of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but the crystalline lenses of fishes' eyes are extremely convex , almost spherical, and their refractive indices are the highest of all the animals. [ 14 ] Birds and mammals normally adjust focus by changing the shape of their lens, but fish normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer to or further from the retina . Due to a refractive index gradient within the lens [ 15 ] the spherical lenses of fish are able to form sharp images free from spherical aberration . [ 16 ] Fish retinas generally have both rod cells and cone cells (for scotopic and photopic vision ), and most species have colour vision . Some fish can see ultraviolet and some are sensitive to polarised light . [ ] [ ] [ ] Among jawless fishes , the lamprey has well-developed eyes, [ 17 ] while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots . [ 18 ] The ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate, [ 19 ] were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one. Fish vision shows evolutionary adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fish have eyes suited to the dark environment. [ ] [ ] [ ] Amphibians [ edit ] [ edit ] Amphibians evolved from lobe finned fish , and generally spend the first part of their life cycle in an aquatic environment and the later part in a terrestrial environment.

( March 2025 ) ( March 2025 ) March 2025 Humans [ edit ] [ edit ] The human eye is not adapted for underwater vision, but by wearing a flat diving mask , humans can see clearly underwater. [ 2 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The mask's flat window separates the eyes from the surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. [ 2 ] But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) in a manner similar to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources. [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] While wearing a flat scuba mask or goggles , objects underwater will appear 33% bigger (34% bigger in salt water) or 25% closer than they actually are. [ 2 ] Also pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration are noticeable. Double-dome masks restore natural sized underwater vision and field of view, with certain limitations. [ 2 ] [ 22 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Optical correction [ edit ] [ edit ] Divers can wear contact lenses under the diving mask or helmet. The risk of loss depends on the security of the mask or helmet, and is very low with a helmet. Framed lenses are available for wear in some helmets and full-face masks, but they can be difficult to defog if there is no fresh, dry, gas flow over them. The frame may be mounted to the helmet or mask, or worn on the head in the usual way, but they cannot be adjusted during a dive if they move out of position. Glasses worn outside the mask will have different refraction out of the water to underwater, because of the different refractive indices of air and water in contact with the lens surfaces. Diving masks can be fitted with lenses for divers needing optical correction to improve vision. Corrective lenses are ground flat on one side and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and below the surface of the water as the curved surface of the lens is in contact with air in both cases. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard corrective lenses are available which can be fitted. Plastic self-adhesive lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask floods. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ ] [ ] Physiological variations [ edit ] [ edit ] A very near-sighted person can see more or less normally underwater [ citation needed ] . Scuba divers with interest in underwater photography may notice presbyopic changes while diving before they recognize the symptoms in their normal routines due to the near focus in low light conditions. [ 24 ] citation needed [ ] The Moken people of South-East Asia are able to focus underwater to pick up tiny shellfish and other food items. [ 25 ] Gislén et al. have compared Moken and untrained European children and found that the underwater visual acuity of the Moken was twice that of their untrained European counterparts. [ 26 ] European children after 1 month of training also showed the same level of underwater visual acuity. [ 27 ] This is due to the contraction of the pupil , instead of the usual dilation ( mydriasis ) that is undergone when a normal, untrained eye, accustomed to viewing in air, is submerged. [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Color vision [ edit ] [ edit ] Water attenuates light due to absorption [ 2 ] which varies as a function of frequency. In other words, as light passes through a greater distance of water color is selectively absorbed by the water. Color absorption is also affected by turbidity of the water and dissolved material. [ ] Water preferentially absorbs red light, and to a lesser extent, yellow, green and violet light, so the color that is least absorbed by water is blue light. [ 3 ] Particulates and dissolved materials may absorb different frequencies, and this will affect the color at depth, with results such as the typically green color in many coastal waters, and the dark red-brown color of many freshwater rivers and lakes due to dissolved organic matter. [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] Fluorescent paints absorb higher frequency light to which the human eye is relatively insensitive and emit lower frequencies, which are more easily detected. The emitted light and the reflected light combine and may be considerably more visible than the original light. The most visible frequencies are also those most rapidly attenuated in water, so the effect is for greatly increased colour contrast over a short range, until the longer wavelengths are attenuated by the water.

For murky, turbid water of low visibility (rivers, harbors, etc.) B. For moderately turbid water (sounds, bays, coastal water). C. For clear water (southern water, [ clarification needed ] deep water offshore, etc.). clarification needed The most difficult colors at the limits of visibility with a water background are dark colors such as gray or black. Visibility [ edit ] [ edit ] Visibility is a term which generally predicts the ability of some human or instrument to detect an object in the given environment, and may be expressed as a measure of the distance at which an object or light can be discerned. [ 4 ] The theoretical black body visibility of pure water based on the values for the optical properties of water for light of 550 nm has been estimated at 74 m. [ 29 ] For the case of a relatively large object, sufficiently illuminated by daylight, the horizontal visibility of the object is a function of the photopic beam attenuation coefficient (spectral sensitivity of the eye). This function has been reported as 4.6 divided by the photopic beam attenuation coefficient. [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Factors affecting visibility include: particles in the water ( turbidity ), salinity gradients ( haloclines ), temperature gradients ( thermoclines ) and dissolved organic matter. [ 5 ] [ ] Reduction of contrast with distance in a horizontal plane at a specific wavelength has been found to depend directly on the beam attenuation coefficient for that wavelength. The inherent contrast of a black target is -1, so the visibility of a black target in the horizontal direction depends on a single parameter, which is not the case for any other colour or direction, making horizontal visibility of a black target the simplest case, and for this reason it has been proposed as a standard for underwater visibility, as it can be measured with reasonably simple instrumentation. [ 30 ] [ ] The photopic beam attenuation coefficient, on which diver visibility depends, is the attenuation of natural light as perceived by the human eye, but in practice it is simpler and more usual to measure the attenuation coefficient for one or more wavelength bands. It has been shown that the function 4.8 divided by the photopic beam attenuation coefficient, as derived by Davies-Colley, gives a value for visibility with an average error of less than 10% for a large range of typical coastal and inland water conditions and viewing conditions, and the beam attenuation coefficients for a single wavelength band at about 530 nm peak is a suitable proxy for the full visible spectrum for many practical purposes with some small adjustments. [ 30 ] [ ] Measurement of visibility [ edit ] [ edit ] The standard measurement for underwater visibility is the distance at which a Secchi disc can be seen.
The range of underwater vision is usually limited by turbidity . In very clear water visibility may extend as far as about 80m, [ 31 ] and a record Secchi depth of 79 m has been reported from a coastal polynya of the Eastern Weddell Sea , Antarctica. [ 31 ] In other sea waters, Secchi depths in the 50 to 70 m range have occasionally been recorded, including a 1985 record of 53 m in the Eastern  and up to 62 m in the tropical Pacific Ocean. This level of visibility is seldom found in surface freshwater. [ 31 ] Crater Lake , Oregon , is often cited for clarity, but the maximum recorded Secchi depth using a 2 m disc is 44 m. [ 31 ] The lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica and Silfra in Iceland have also been reported as exceptionally clear. [ citation needed ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] citation needed Visibility can be measured in an arbitrary direction, and of various colour targets, but horizontal visibility of a black target reduces the variables and meets the requirements for a straight-forward and robust parameter for underwater visibility, which can be used to make operational decisions for mine hunters and explosive ordnance disposal teams. [ 4 ] [ ] An instrument for measuring underwater visibility basically measures light transmission through the water between the target and the observer, to calculate the loss, and is called a transmissometer . By measuring the amount of light which is transmitted from a light source of known strength and wavelength distribution, through a known distance of water to a calibrated light meter, the clarity of water can be objectively quantified. [ 32 ] A wavelength of 532 nm (green) aligns well with the peak of the human visual perception spectrum, but other wavelengths may be used. [ 4 ] Transmissometers are more sensitive at low particulate concentration and are better suited for measuring relatively clear water. [ 33 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Measurement of turbidity [ edit ] [ edit ] Nephelometers are used for measuring suspended particles in turbid waters where they have a more linear response than transmissometers. Turbidity, or cloudiness, of water is a relative measure. It is an apparent optical property which varies depending on the properties of the suspended particles, illumination, and instrument characteristics. Turbidity is measured in nephelometer units referenced to a turbidity standard or in Formazin Turbidity Units . [ 33 ] [ ] Nephelometers measure the light scattered by suspended particles and respond mainly to the first-order effects of particle size and concentration. Depending on manufacturer, nephelometers measure scattered light in the range between about 90° to 165° off the axis of the beam, and usually use infra-red light with a wavelength of around 660 nm because this wavelength is rapidly absorbed by water, so there is very little contamination of the source due to ambient daylight except near to the surface. [ 33 ] [ ] Low visibility [ edit ] [ edit ] Low visibility refers to a diving environment where the diving medium is turbid and objects cannot be seen clearly at short range even with artificial illumination. The term is not usually used to refer to a simple lack of illumination when the medium is clear. Zero visibility is used to describe conditions when the diver can effectively see nothing outside the mask of helmet, and a light must be put against the viewport to see if it is switched on, and it is not possible for a person with normal vision to read normal instruments. (some mask-integrated head-up displays may be legible) Low visibility is defined by NOAA for operational purposes as: "When visual contact with the dive buddy can no longer be maintained." [ 34 ] [ ] DAN-Southern Africa suggest that limited visibility is when a "buddy cannot be discerned at a distance greater than 3 metres."

In recent years, with the development of underwater vehicles  ( ROV , AUV , gliders ), the need to be able to record and process huge amounts of information has become increasingly important.  Applications range from inspection of underwater structures for the offshore industry to the identification and counting of fishes for biological research.  However, no matter how big the impact of this technology can be to industry and research, it still is in a very early stage of development compared to traditional computer vision. One reason for this is that, the moment the camera goes into the water, a whole new set of challenges appear. On one hand, cameras have to be made waterproof, marine corrosion deteriorates materials quickly and access and modifications to experimental setups are costly, both in time and resources. On the other hand, the physical properties of the water make light behave differently, changing the appearance of a same object with variations of depth, organic material, currents, temperature etc. Applications [ edit ] [ edit ] Seafloor survey Vehicle navigation and positioning [ 1 ] [ ] Biological monitoring [ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ] {possibly aquatic biomonitoring ) citation needed clarification needed Video mosaics as visual navigation maps Submarine pipeline inspection Wreckage visualization [ clarification needed ] [ citation needed ] clarification needed citation needed Maintenance of underwater structures [ citation needed ] citation needed Drowning detection systems Medium differences [ edit ] [ edit ] Illumination [ edit ] [ edit ] In air, light comes from the whole hemisphere on cloudy days, and is dominated by the sun. In water direct lighting comes from a cone about 96° wide above the scene. This phenomenon is called Snell's window . [ 2 ] [ ] Artificial lighting can be used where natural light levels are insufficient and where the light path is too long to produce acceptable colour, as the loss of colour is a function of the total distance through water from the source to the camera lens port. [ 3 ] [ ]   This section needs expansion with: artificial illumination and Backscatter. You can help by adding to it . ( July 2024 ) ( July 2024 ) July 2024 Light attenuation [ edit ] [ edit ] Unlike air, [ citation needed ] water attenuates light exponentially. This results in hazy images with very low contrast. [ clarification needed ] The main reasons for light attenuation are light absorption (where energy is removed from the light) and light scattering, by which the direction of light is changed. Light scattering can further be divided into forward scattering, which results in an increased blurriness and backward scattering that limits the contrast and is responsible for the characteristic veil of underwater images. Both scattering and attenuation are heavily influenced by the amount of organic matter dissolved or suspended in the water. [ citation needed ] citation needed clarification needed citation needed Light attenuation in water is also a function of the wavelength. This means that different colours are attenuated at different rates, leading to colour degradation.with depth and distance. Red and orange light are attenuated faster, followed by yellows and greens. Blue is the least attenuated visible wavelength. [ 4 ] [ ]   This section needs expansion with: light attenuation by turbidity. You can help by adding to it . ( March 2021 ) ( March 2021 ) March 2021 Artificial lighting [ edit ] [ edit ]   This section is empty. You can help by adding to it . ( July 2024 ) ( July 2024 ) July 2024 Challenges [ edit ] [ edit ] In high level computer vision, human structures are frequently used as image features for image matching in different applications. However, the sea bottom lacks such features, making it hard to find correspondences in two images. In order to be able to use a camera in the water, a watertight housing is required. However, refraction will happen at the water-glass and glass-air interface due to differences in density of the materials. This has the effect of introducing a non-linear image deformation. The motion of the vehicle presents another special challenge. Underwater vehicles are constantly moving due to currents and other phenomena. This introduces another uncertainty to algorithms, where small motions may appear in all directions. This can be specially important for video tracking . In order to reduce this problem image stabilization algorithms may be applied. Relevant technology [ edit ] [ edit ] Image restoration [ edit ] [ edit ] Image restoration< techniques are intended to  model the degradation process and then invert it, obtaining the new image after solving. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It is generally a complex approach that requires plenty of parameters [ clarification needed ] that vary a lot between different water conditions. [ ] [ ] clarification needed Image enhancement [ edit ] [ edit ] Image enhancement [ 7 ] only tries to provide a visually more appealing image without taking the physical image formation process into account. These methods are usually simpler and less computational intensive. [ ] Color correction [ edit ] [ edit ] Various algorithms exist that perform automatic color correction. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The UCM  (Unsupervised Color Correction Method), for example, does this in the following steps: It firstly reduces the color cast by equalizing the color values. Then it enhances contrast by stretching the red histogram towards the maximum and finally saturation and intensity components are optimized. [ citation needed ] [ ] [ ] citation needed Underwater stereo vision [ edit ] [ edit ] It is usually assumed that stereo cameras have been calibrated previously, geometrically and radiometrically. This leads to the assumption that corresponding pixels should have the same color. However this can not be guaranteed in an underwater scene, because of dispersion and backscatter. However, it is possible to digitally model this phenomenon and create a virtual image with those effects removed Other application fields [ edit ] [ edit ] Imaging sonars [ 10 ] [ 11 ] have become more and more accessible and gained resolution, delivering better images. Sidescan sonars are used to produce complete maps of regions of the sea floor stitching together sequences of sonar images. However, sonar images often lack proper contrast [ clarification needed ] and are degraded by artefacts and distortions due to noise, attitude changes of the AUV/ROV carrying the sonar or non uniform beam patterns.  Another common problem with sonar computer vision is the comparatively low frame rate of sonar images.

He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record (first among NASA astronauts) and having the fifth-longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. López-Alegría commanded Axiom-1 , the first ever all-private team of commercial astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which launched on April 8, 2022, and spent just over 17 days in Earth's orbit. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Background Son of a Spanish father and an American mother, López-Alegría was born in Madrid , Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California . After graduating from Mission Viejo High School , [ 4 ] López-Alegría joined the United States Navy , where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy , and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School . Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his aviation experience in the Navy was as an instructor pilot in Training Squadron 2 (VT-2) at Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Pensacola, Florida, at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 ( VQ-2 ) in Rota, Spain , and the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River , Maryland . He was the first EP-3E pilot to be selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School 's Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian. [ ] His son Nicolas starred alongside López-Alegría in 2006 in Mira La Luna (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, Son And Moon , was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin , Sunita Williams , and him. Mission record López-Alegría's first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA 's International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff , flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft. [ 5 ] [ ] López-Alegría served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. [ 6 ] [ ] On September 20, 2006, López-Alegría docked with the ISS as commander of Expedition 14 , having taken off from Baikonur , Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9 . On Expedition 14 , he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007, he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth. López-Alegría holds the all-time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross , had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. López-Alegría is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia's Anatoly Solovyev . On April 2, 2007, López-Alegría set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days [ 7 ] (the longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov , who spent 438 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995). [ ] List of EVAs 2000-10-16  7:07 hours STS-92 ,  EVA 2 2000-10-18  6:56 hours  STS-92,  EVA 4 2002-11-26  6:45 hours STS-113 , EVA 1 2002-11-28  6:10 hours  STS-113, EVA 2 2002-11-30  7:00 hours  STS-113, EVA 3 2006-11-22  7:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14 , EVA 1 2007-01-31  7:55 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 2 2007-02-04  7:11 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 3 2007-02-07  6:39 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 4 2007-02-22  6:18 hours  ISS Expedition 14, EVA 5 At the end of his ISS mission, he commanded the longest flight by a Soyuz spacecraft, making Expedition 14 the longest expedition thus far. López-Alegría broke the record for longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. [ 8 ] [ ] Post-NASA career López-Alegría retired from NASA on March 12, 2012 [ 9 ] and served as the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation through the end of 2014.
López-Alegría is an independent consultant to traditional and commercial space companies, serves on several advisory boards and committees to public and private organizations, and is engaged in public speaking domestically and internationally. He is based in Washington, DC. [ ] In 2017 López-Alegría joined Axiom Space as director of Business Development. [ 10 ] He flew in space again in 2022 as commander of Axiom Mission 1 , the first Axiom Space Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] López-Alegría was the commander of Axiom Mission 3 , which launched on 18 January 2024.

Diving [ edit ] [ edit ] Bill Nagle was one of the earliest divers to dive regularly beyond diver training agency specified depth limits for safe deep diving (normally 130 feet in sea water). [ citation needed ] Nagle regularly dived to greater depths, and engaged in hazardous shipwreck penetration, often on previously unexplored shipwrecks. [ citation needed ] citation needed citation needed In 1985 Nagle led the team of divers, including Gary Gentile , Art Kirchner, Tom Packer, Mike Boring, John Moyer and Kenny Gascon, who recovered the bell of the Andrea Doria , which had previously been thought lost and unrecoverable. [ 1 ] The story of the recovery expedition is recounted in Gary Gentile's book, Andrea Doria: Dive to an Era . [ citation needed ] [ ] citation needed Nagle was also one of the first people in the Northeastern United States to commence dive chartering as a full-time business with the custom dive vessel, the Seeker . [ citation needed ] citation needed During Nagle's prime, divers who exceeded agency specified safety limits were simply referred to as "gorilla divers". [ 2 ] [ ] Alcoholism and death [ edit ] [ edit ] The later years of Nagle's life were dominated by a descent into alcoholism and drug abuse .  It was this disease that ultimately took his life at the age of 41. [ citation needed ] His last great expedition was the exploration of German submarine U-869 , although he was never physically able to dive on it.  Nagle died before the wreck was positively identified. citation needed His close friend, John Chatterton refused to attend his funeral, insisting that the man inside the coffin was not his friend and associate - it was the monster who had killed Bill Nagle. [ 3 ] Richie Kohler , another diver closely connected with the U-869 expedition, was one of the pallbearers . [ ] Footnotes [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ "Treasures of the Andrea Doria " .

In the book, Shadow Divers , Robert Kurson indicates that the team had a "last man standing" arrangement, whereby the last one of them left alive would keep the bell.

Nationality   [ edit ] [ edit ] Nationality should be revised. As far as I know, anyone born in Spain gets the Spanish nationality automatically, and López Alegría was born in Madrid.  No, that is a mistake. Spanish law regarding nationality is based on blood, not land--this means your nationality depends on that of your parents, not on where you were born. That is actually the norm in the majority of European (and Western) countries, with the very notable exception of the US. I have no info on the nationality of MLA, though. Fsoto1969 ( talk ) 09:44, 7 September 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] [ reply ] [ ]  longest spaceflight...   [ edit ] [ edit ] this article and the article on Expedition 14 differ a bit. Here it says "López-Alegría broke the record for longest spaceflight by an American astornaut." The Expedition 14 article says (I edited it because it still used future tense): "Lopez-Alegria, already the U.S. recordholder for spacewalks, now also holds the record for longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut."  Shouldn't there be a clear distinction between a NASA astronaut and an American astronaut, even if it that meant he held both records? Or do you have to be American to be a NASA astronaut anyway? I am not sure, but wondering about this. Oh, and what about the two ´s on his name?
