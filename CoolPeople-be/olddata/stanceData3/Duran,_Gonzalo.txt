This is not just a campaign—it is a movement built on the belief that New York City deserves leadership as dynamic and diverse as its people. As a Marine, community leader, and dedicated public servant, I have spent my life fighting for the Bronx, for New York City, and for our country. My commitment to service, leadership, and accountability has prepared me to take on the critical role of Public Advocate and be the voice that New Yorkers deserve. My background, shaped by military service, nonprofit leadership, and hands-on political experience, equips me with the skills to hold city agencies accountable and address the pressing concerns of everyday New Yorkers. New Yorkers are facing serious challenges—crime, rising costs, and a disconnect between leadership and the real needs of our communities. Too often, those in power serve entrenched interests rather than the people. I am stepping up to change that. My mission is to restore trust in government, ensure transparency, and fight for policies that make New York a safer, more livable city for all. As Public Advocate, I will take the fight directly to City Hall—introducing and co-sponsoring legislation, providing critical oversight of city agencies, and ensuring that the voices of all New Yorkers are heard. I will not just listen to complaints about city services—I will act to fix them. My plan prioritizes accountability, transparency, and real solutions that improve the quality of life for every resident. With your support, we will bring real change to City Hall. I invite all New Yorkers to stand with me, to demand better, and to be part of a movement that puts people first. The time for action is now. Let’s make New York City stronger, safer, and more accountable—together. Thank you, and as always, God Bless America.

This issue has been a long battle of getting what the city had originally promised. While it is in the works that a full-service animal shelter will be built, there has not been a site picked out yet. As Councilman, Gonzalo knows that Bronx animals need help now. Increase funding of TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) programs to provide more accessibility to service vans, like the Toby Project, in Bronx communities to ease the strain on local rescuers. This will also allow these programs to continue operating so that they can provide low-cost spay and neuter; veterinary services to residents in low-income areas.

We have overlooked many alternatives for transportation. Gonzalo supports the Citywide Ferry Service and believes that more parts of the Bronx should be included in its expansion as well as introducing  more bike and alternative transportation programs. Assess areas within the 15th Council District that are high traffic zones and have high accident rates to determine what can be done to alleviate the problem. Limit the funding given to transportation agencies. Any funding that will be given to them must show where and that all the funding is going towards demonstrated improvements in the system. An evaluation of how accessible train stations and bus depots are for those who are disabled is long overdue.

At Council District 15 we have our own little gems through Tremont Park, Richman Park, and Ciccarone Park to name a few. But many times, the same parks are given funding while other neighborhoods are looked over. As Councilman, Gonzalo believes we should keep The Bronx green by: Put into law the increased access to waterfront land and green space for all Bronx residents. Improve current green spaces, like parks, and encourage the formation of more community gardens. Through programs like Partnerships for Parks, the surrounding Botanical Gardens and Bronx River can serve as opportunities for learning through educational classes aimed to teach school children about ways to take care of the environment. These classes can also extend to adults and families through nutritional education and agricultural development of land (i.e. in community gardens or by transforming empty lots into gardens). Encourage schools to add in environmental awareness to their curriculum so that the younger generation can understand the impacts we have on the environment, how to take care of it, and ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Secure funding for our parks that have been neglected or overlooked in obtaining updated equipment or necessary repairs. Additionally, make parks safer so that the community can feel comfortable bringing their families to parks.

Many have left home to defend our nation on the battlefield only to return home to face another battle. This is partially because many of the programs implemented for their integration is filled with red-taped of bureaucracy. Any Veteran returning home to use their educational benefits can be denied housing. Although it is against the law because of discrimination, it happens and Veterans have very little recourse. If they seek assistance from any government organization or through most nonprofit programs, they need to have one year’s worth of supervised homelessness before getting direct assistance. Gonzalo believes that the Veteran community has received sufficient amounts of money to help secure them from homelessness and unemployment. The real problem here is the way it has been spent. As a Veteran, Gonzalo has been through these hardships and from that has a keen view of the problem which he has battled as the Chief Executive Officer of Devil Dog USA Incorporated. As Councilman, Gonzalo plans to initiate a systematic approach of cooperation with local and national organizations to fill in the cracks in the system and then combat the major problems individually. Providing Veterans with documentation approved by the city acknowledging the amount of money they have received and include a time line of the educational benefits they have. This will give brokers, landlords and realtors easy to understand information so that they can better understand these benefits. If denied housing without proper cause, the Veterans will have the full support of legal representation from legal organizations backed by the Councilman’s office.

With changes in the economy, more housing and a lesser quality of life, there is an increase in crime that leaves a huge burden for New York’s Finest to serve. These issues are compounded by the continuing disconnect between the police and the public. As Councilman, Gonzalo knows that while there is a need to increase the NYPD workforce, this is only one part of the solution. Increase the amount of NYPD and surveillance to areas with high crime rates. Bring back cops to ‘walk the beat’ so that they get to know the individuals in the area they patrol.

Constituents cannot help but feel that their voices are unheard and their concerns are ignored. This dilemma has left a sour taste in the community causing many people to not vote at all because they feel their vote holds no weight. Civil engagement with the community has always been an important part of working with Veterans and their families. As Councilman, Gonzalo wants to keep an active line of communication between the community and his office. Each neighborhood within the 15th council district will have a town hall to allow constituents an opportunity to express their concerns pertaining to their area. It is important to remember that local problems require local solutions. Actively keep the public abreast on proposed policies through better engagement with constituents and cooperation with all political parties. One of Gonzalo’s goals is to have more residents registered to vote, apply for public positions and increase participation in community boards. Continue Participatory Budgeting so that residents can vote on how their tax dollars are spent and increase the participation of the community members.

Developers cash in on this trend by allowing a very small portion of the new housing to be affordable while the rest is considered luxury. The end result of this is only going to displace many residents as rents will increase. If the trend continues, it is possible that within the next 10 years, the only people who will be able to live in the Bronx will be the wealthy or those on public assistance. Gonzalo plans to fight hard against these trends. Add in stronger regulations directed towards developers when building housing. Give residents a stronger voice in new housing developments as well as giving priority to current residents in need of affordable housing. Encourage landlords to cap rent at an affordable level. Build stronger legislation to protect residents from landlords who drastically raise the rent. Protect the rights and needs of senior and disabled tenants.

I attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where I engaged in wrestling, volunteered at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, worked as a bag boy in a local supermarket, and participated in other extracurricular activities. Initially drawn to animal sciences with aspirations of becoming a veterinarian, my path shifted during my senior year when I volunteered to join the United States Marine Corps. During my eight years of military service, I reached the rank of Sergeant and completed one tour in Iraq. As a devoted father of two, I faced significant challenges upon leaving the military, experiencing homelessness and job struggles. Eventually, I graduated from Fordham University with a Bachelor of Science in Health Science, aspiring to become a doctor. Once stable again, I excelled at the Bronx Veterans Affairs and the Bronx Labor Department but grew disenchanted with their limitations. As a Marine Corps Veteran, I witnessed the struggles faced by fellow Veterans and chose to take action. As the Chief Executive Officer of Devil Dog USA Incorporated, I addressed the needs of Bronx Veterans and the community, advocating for mental health awareness, suicide prevention, unemployment, and ending homelessness through housing programs, employment workshops, and recreational activities. Concerned about the economic challenges in my neighborhood, I am driven to change the trajectory. I envision a future where the next generation of Bronxites can afford to live in their community. Focused on combating the impact of luxury housing and high-end stores, I believe in entering the political arena to bring about positive change.

Causes for this are many and require a powerful lens to determine how to fix this. It started with current elected officials selling out our health at the cost of generating more attractions and revenue for tourists. As Councilman, Gonzalo believes that access is one of the main solutions to this issue. Ways to help increase Bronx resident’s health: Bring in more green / farmer markets while putting aside more funding for vouchers (Health Bucks for SNAP/EBT) to those on public assistance so that they can have more access to healthier foods. Limit the number of fast food restaurants that over-populate disadvantaged areas. Start education on healthy living by bringing in educational programs to schools like cooking and nutritional based classes. Support programs already established, such as the Green City Force program that teaches NYCHA residents to farm in their own complexes. Locate areas that are “food deserts” (neighborhoods that have little access to healthy foods) to deny bids by fast food corporations who want to add new store fronts while giving priority to supermarkets that promise to provide the neighborhood with healthy, affordable food.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 15, 2025 Gonzalo Duran (516) 515 – 0240 Gonzalodurannyc@gmail.com Bronx, New York – To my fellow Conservative Party members, it is with deep regret that I inform you the Conservative Party has chosen not to select me as its candidate for Mayor of New York City. While I respect the Party’s decision, I firmly believe this represents a missed opportunity—not just for me, but for the Party and the people we serve. That said, I will not challenge the Party’s chosen candidate. My commitment has always been about fighting for the values we hold dear. I have always believed that leadership is proven through action, and my work is far from over. I will continue doing what I do best—working relentlessly to serve my community, grow our movement, and strengthen our Party from within. When the time comes to stand before Party leadership again, I want there to be no doubt that I am more than ready to take on any role, any challenge, and any fight necessary to advance our shared vision. My next steps will be swift and decisive. This is not the end—it is simply the beginning of a new chapter. Thank you, and as always, God Bless America. ### Share this: Share Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

This is not just a campaign—it is a movement ingrained in the belief that New York City deserves leadership that is as dynamic and diverse as its people. Recently, Patrick McManus, Chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, challenged our members at our monthly meeting to step up and take action. I am proud to say that I was the first to answer that call and put my bid forward. With a background shaped by military service, leadership in the nonprofit sector, and hands-on experience in county-level politics, I stand ready to serve the great people of New York City with unwavering commitment. My passion for this city and its residents fuels my desire to make New York safer, more livable, and a place where every New Yorker can thrive. One of the greatest challenges we face in today’s political system is a lack of true diversity and representation. Too often, those in power are chosen by entrenched interests, not by the people themselves. This disconnect between leadership and the real needs of our city has left us grappling with critical issues—crime, rising costs, and the erosion of our quality of life. The time has come for us to take a stand. I believe the Conservative Party has an opportunity—and an obligation—to be bold in this race. We must not compromise our principles or dilute our vision. We must stand firm and put forth a candidate who represents the values of hard work, personal responsibility, and a deep commitment to the future of New York City. The progress we have made in recent elections shows the strength of our movement, and now is not the time to retreat. We must move forward with purpose and determination. I am committed to being the voice of conservatives across all five boroughs. I have already begun conversations with leaders in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, and I look forward to meeting with those in Queens and Staten Island in the days ahead. Together, we will build a united front that reflects the heart and soul of our city—a city that embraces its diversity, honors its history, and faces its challenges with a clear-eyed vision for the future. I am determined to gain the support of county and state party leadership, and to build on the momentum we have already established. We cannot afford to let our party’s influence weaken or miss this critical moment to bring real, lasting change to New York City. If I am elected mayor, I will fully and properly fund the New York Police Department, ensuring that our officers have the resources they need to protect and serve all New Yorkers. I will take a firm stance against crime, focusing on tackling issues like drugs, prostitution, and repeat offenders, and holding criminals accountable for their actions. At the same time, my administration will work hand in hand with community leaders to create a city that is inclusive, safe, and respectful of every New Yorker’s rights. Restoring affordability to New York City is one of my most pressing goals. Achieving this will require not only the full support of my administration but also the collective effort of all New Yorkers. Together, we can begin to tackle the housing crisis, reduce the cost of living, and ensure that our city remains accessible to those who have helped build it. What happens here in New York City has ripple effects across the nation—our actions set the tone for the rest of the country, and we have the opportunity to lead by example. This is a crucial moment for New York City. We are at a crossroads, and the decisions we make today will shape the future for generations to come. Together, we can restore New York’s promise and create a future where all can prosper. I ask for your support as we embark on this journey to build a safer, stronger, and more prosperous New York City—for everyone. Thank you.
