COMBATING HATE CRIMES Queens is the home of diversity and tolerance. There is no place in our borough for division and hate. But the past few years, we have seen our country divided, and unfortunately we have also seen our divisions in our borough. This has shown itself with an increase of hate crimes and bias incidents. This must stop now. While the pandemic paused many of our lives, we still saw a 99% increase of bias incidents. The New York Police Department confirms what we all know. There has been anincrease of anti-Asian and anti-Semitic hate crimes. This hatred is rooted in ignorance. We must stamp it out. There is much work to do as a city in order to protect communities most susceptible to acts of hate. We can do better to protect vulnerable communities and we must strengthen those institutions so they bring justice. I am demanding that the NYPD change it’s threshold on what we consider hate crimes. Too often people face violence and are told it’s not a hate crime. But we know better. Our communities understand the impact of structural and systemic racism, and implicit bias. We know when the acts against us are petty nonsense and when they are an attack on our identity and our very existence. The city needs to provide more funding to expand the Commission’s Bias Response Team and education efforts to help dispel myths and combat these acts of hate. I am calling on law enforcement agencies, tasked with combatting these acts of hate and discrimination, to create a central database for information sharing, so they work closer together in addressing acts of hate – whether they are bias incidents or hate crimes. In order for all are welcome in Queens, we must lead the way. We will work to combat hate crimes, bias incidents, and other acts of hate and discrimination. Let’s send a message to the world that all are welcome in our borough. Let’s get to work. stay in touch RichardsForQueens@gmail.com Paid for by Friends Of Donovan Richards Info Meet Donovan Issues Video Action Volunteer Contact Donate Action Kit

"These catastrophic storms are going to be more frequent as we move forward based on what we know all too well that climate change is going to continue to [rear] its ugly head," he told CNN. The state of emergency issued overnight is not enough and the federal government needs to step up on its action against climate change, he added.

The College Point Task Force, Richards announced on Thursday, June 17, includes elected officials, agency officials and community leaders, who will collectively develop and implement solutions in the community. The current issues are related to the sewer construction project, which is taking about five years to complete and causing excessive noise; the loss of parking space; and hazardous road conditions, according to Richards. “Our new College Point Task Force will meet regularly to address the issues facing the community, ensuring a reliable channel of communication between city officials and the neighborhood’s residents and homeowners,” Richards said. “We will work together to fix the quality-of-life issues in the area and to bring this sewer project to an environmentally conscious, speedy and successful conclusion.” Street vendors call on Queens lawmakers to help halt aggressive fines for unlicensed workers A large crowd of mostly Spanish-speaking street vendors, gathered in Corona Plaza on Wednesday, June 16, to call upon lawmakers to stop heavily enforced fines from being issued to street vendors struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said that as New York City reopens we shouldn’t forget who kept the city running during the pandemic. “These were the essential workers,” Richards said. “There are those who had the luxury of staying home and working on a computer. These folks were the ones that ran into the burning building. They are the reason this city is reopening today, may we not forget.” Instead of penalizing hardworking street vendors, Richards said the city should be ensuring they get credit lines and grants. Queens College breaks ground on $9.3M soccer field renovation project Elected officials on June 16 joined Queens College staff and students for a groundbreaking ceremony for the college’s soccer field and track renovation project.

Wu, CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez, and Queens College student-athlete Shannon Gibbons. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said that the ribbon-cutting ceremony was not only about the new soccer field or track, but also about providing students with first-class sports amenities. “We don’t play second fiddle to any other boroughs. In Queens County, we want every CUNY campus to have state-of-the-art everything,” Richards said. “And it’s one of the reasons we announced $4.5 million for CUNY institutions across the borough a few weeks ago, and that’s just the beginning of what we’re gonna do.” Fully leased Rockaway Beach medical arts complex expected to provide health care services for about 5,000 community members A medical arts complex in Rockaway Beach is fully leased, and plans to bring top-quality health care to the medically-underserved areas of the Rockaway peninsula.

But the Rockaway Beach Medical Arts Complex, now fully leased, will go a long way toward righting this historical wrong,” Richards said. “We are beyond grateful to our many partners for bringing this complex to life and look forward to the healthier Rockaway it will create.” Richards celebrates opening of new Immigrant Welcome Center at Queens Borough Hall As the city celebrates the contributions of immigrants during Immigrant Heritage Month, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr., alongside elected officials, advocates and leading immigration service providers, officially launched the soft opening of Queens Borough Hall’s new Immigrant Welcome Center with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday, June 15.

The PAC cited Richards’s support for congestion pricing and speed cameras, the Downtown Far Rockaway rezoning, improved transit service, new bike lanes, and reduced parking requirements. And, lest we forget, Richards has come out strongly in favor of converting his borough’s premier open street — on 34th Avenue — into a linear park. According to StreetsPAC, Richards’s “ambitious agenda” includes: a network of protected bike lanes across Queen a network of protected bike lanes across Queen expanded access to bike share expanded access to bike share bike parking at subway stations bike parking at subway stations busways around Jamaica to speed up commutes busways around Jamaica to speed up commutes expanded open streets across the borough expanded open streets across the borough $3 million to build the security fencing enabling the opening of the Queensboro Bridge south outer roadway to bikes. $3 million to build the security fencing enabling the opening of the Queensboro Bridge south outer roadway to bikes.

They also laid out a plan for the future of  the “World’s Borough.” Richards, who is seeking reelection for Queens Borough President after winning the seat vacated by now Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, pointed to the Astoria Houses behind him and underlined how the COVID-19 exacerbated the issues ailing  underserved communities. He said that it was time to not only rebuild, but to reimagine, a better Queens. “You see the Astoria Houses, a development that has sorely needed investment, a development made up of some of the  greatest and best people in this city, but who live in squalor, who live in conditions, unworthy of who they are,” Richards said. He noted that a ZIP code should not determine the level of education nor access to health care, public transportation and quality housing. Queens BP Donovan Richards to Allocate $5.5 Million to Help Build Pediatric ICU at Elmhurst Hospital May 24 | Forest Hills Post Queens Borough President Donovan Richards has pledged $5.5 million in capital funds to Elmhurst Hospital to help build a pediatric intensive care unit and upgrade two main operating rooms. The funds come more than a year after the hospital became known as the epicenter of the epicenter of the pandemic, when videos of body bags being loaded into refrigerated trucks outside the facility made national news. Now the public hospital — no longer overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients — has plans to upgrade its infrastructure with help from Richards’ office.

City Planning Commission launches review to bring green grocery stores to underserved Queens neighborhoods May 24 | QNS The City Planning Commission (CPC) has launched the start of a public review for an update and expansion of the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program to bring convenient, accessible grocery stores to underserved New York neighborhoods — a vital step towards reducing health inequities that were further highlighted by the pandemic.

The program currently applies to Queens Community District 12 in southeast Queens; and will expand to Community Districts 1, 3, and 4 in western Queens and Community District 14 in Far Rockaway. According to Queens Borough President Donovan Richards , food insecurity was a grave threat even before the pandemic, and far too many Queens families live in food deserts without adequate access to fresh produce, fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods they need. “My office will continue to work in close partnership with the Department of City Planning to ensure the expansion of the FRESH program into historically underserved communities in northwestern Queens and Far Rockaway will, in fact, lead to the construction of new, sorely needed supermarkets in these communities,” Richards said.

Meng called Richards as an “extraordinary leader” who fights every day to make life better for Queens residents. “In just his first few months in office, he has traveled throughout our great borough, meeting with residents from across many different communities, and doing all he can to make Queens the best that it can be,” Meng said. “He has worked tirelessly to help hardworking families, assist small businesses, expand affordable housing, and has strongly stood in solidarity with the Asian American community in our fight against the rise in hate and violence.” As they work to move past the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Meng, it is critical to have Richards leading the borough to ensure recovery and to get Queens back on its feet again. “I look forward to continuing working with him for many years to come,” Meng said. In response to Meng’s endorsement, Richards hailed the congresswoman as a “dedicated, trailblazing public servant,” for Queens, and said he is incredibly grateful for her “leadership, partnership and support” for his campaign. “Over the past year, Congresswoman Meng has fought for the stimulus payments, PPP loans, vaccine and testing sites, and federal funding that have helped so many Queens residents through the crisis,” Richards said. “She sponsored the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to combat anti-Asian hate, and here in Queens, she’s helped victims, raised awareness, and marched in support of our Asian communities. She is a great asset to our borough, and I’m excited to keep working with her.” Richards was first elected as Queens Borough President in November 2020, and took office in December.

Rockaway playground opens after $8 million extreme makeover by NYC Parks May 13 | QNS Elected officials and Arverne community leaders cut the ribbon on an $8.1 million total reconstruction of Almeda Playground at Beach 66th Street on Tuesday, May 12. As part of the Community Parks Initiative, the public space has been completely renovated with upgraded features and amenities funded by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The playground now features a more inclusive play area, an outdoor classroom, spray showers, an adult fitness area, basketball and handball courts, shaded seating areas and more. As requested by the community, the project also enhanced the playground’s greenery with a robust planting palette. “Almeda Playground is a treasured community resource in Arverne, so I’m pleased that this extensive and much-needed reconstruction of the playground has been completed,” said Queens Borough President Donovan Richards , who grew up in the nearby Ocean Village apartments. “All children deserve access to first-class play space, and the Community Parks Initiative has succeeded in creating such a space here at Almeda Playground and at so many other parks throughout the borough and the city. I thank Mayor de Blasio and NYC Parks, led by Commissioner Silver, for putting high-quality open space where they can safely play, gather and enjoy the outdoors.” City to Create “Bike Boulevard” Along 39th Avenue in Sunnyside May 11 | Sunnyside Post The city will create a “bike boulevard” along 39th Avenue in Sunnyside by the end of the year, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today. The avenue is one of five streets across the city that will be transformed into bike boulevards by either November or December this year. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will be creating one “bike boulevard” per borough. “Street safety is a paramount concern for all us in New York City—and here in Queens, that is especially true,” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said in a statement. “Our cyclists should not feel unsafe when out commuting, and installing more bike lanes will give them the protection they need. A Linear Park on 34th Avenue Can Lead the Reimagining of Our Streets May 11 | Streetsblog Righting these historical wrongs will not happen overnight. Creating a city truly rooted in equity across the spectrum is going to take bold leadership and a true grassroots approach. On 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, we already have the blueprint on how to do just that — and 34th Avenue should serve as a model for the rest of New York City and beyond. Every time I visit, I am amazed. From tai chi classes to hopscotch to English as a Second Language programming, the Jackson Heights community was creative in utilizing their streets, and every member of that community deserves applause. It is no secret that our more densely populated communities like Jackson Heights, Jamaica, and Far Rockaway are home to just a fraction of our borough’s expansive greenspace. It’s also no secret that such a glaring lack of urban space is itself a threat to public safety, significantly increasing the grave health risks pedestrians face in the form of reckless driving and air pollution. That’s why I called for a significant expansion of the Open Streets program during my State of the Borough address in March . It’s why I rallied last month with the 34th Avenue Open Streets Coalition and other neighbors to demand the Jackson Heights space be made permanent. It’s why I believe there can be no compromise when it comes to radically redefining open space in each of our communities. On 34th Avenue, I am calling on the Mayor’s Office and the Department of Transportation to act immediately to turn what they have called the “gold standard” into a golden opportunity for good. Queens Beep Pledges Big Cash for Queensboro Bridge Pedestrian Project May 10 | Streetsblog Queens Borough President Donovan Richards will announce on Tuesday that he will allocate $3 million to underwrite a security fence on the Queensboro Bridge to reduce yet another hurdle for the city in its stated plan to create dedicated space for pedestrians and cyclists on the dangerously packed span. “The Queensboro Bridge serves as a gateway to Manhattan and the western side of the World’s Borough, and it is about time we ensure the bridge is safe for all who utilize it — and not just drivers,” Richards told Streetsblog. “Traffic safety is a critical issue at this moment in our city’s history, and we need to protect our cyclists and pedestrians as well.” Nearly 10,000 Queens Residents Have Succumbed to COVID-19 May 5 | Astoria Post The total number of Queens residents killed by COVID-19 is approaching 10,000, although the daily death count is now in the single digits. The borough has had a daily death toll in the single digits for nearly a week — a far cry from the height of the pandemic when 201 residents died in a single day on April 6, 2020. Queens has experienced the second greatest loss of life among the boroughs at 9,760 deaths, just behind Brooklyn. The number of deaths includes both 8,424 confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1,336 probable COVID-19 deaths — in which a person’s cause of death is listed as COVID-19, but a positive test is not on record. Local legislators like Queens Borough President Donovan Richards — who was the council member representing the neighborhood last year — said that many lives in Far Rockaway could have been spared from the devastating virus if the area had gotten COVID-19 testing from the city sooner. Flushing ranks No. 2 in anti-Asian attacks - Hundreds stood in solidarity against increasing AAPI bias and violence May 5 | Queens Chronicle A 15-year-old boy minding his own business in Forest Hills became another victim of anti-Asian violence last Saturday. Police said he was alone near 99th Street and 62nd Drive when three teenagers approached him and began calling him slurs. The harassment turned violent after the 14-, 15- and 18-year-old perpetrators began whaling on the boy, who sustained minor injuries and was sent to NewYork-Presbyterian Queens. The incident is just one of the 42 reported attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in New York City this year. Crimes targeting the AAPI community made up about 44 percent of all hate attacks in the city as of May 5, according to rolling NYPD hate crime data.

Instead, it is on every one of us to be that vaccine and to stand up as one, united community to end hate in all its hideous forms,” Borough President Donovan Richards , who organized the rally, said. “Here in The World’s Borough, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. This is why we march: to show those who would spew bigotry that they will never succeed, and that Queens will never be a place of hate.” Make way for the greenway May 5 | Queens Chronicle The Vanderbilt Motor Parkway may be closed for the summer, but users can expect to hit the trail once again in September.

City expands violence interrupter program to southeast Queens May 5 | QNS Southeast Queens elected officials and community leaders are welcoming the city’s plan for an expansion of its violence interrupter network into the 105th Precinct in Queens Village. The expansion of the program aims to address the public safety concerns in the Laurelton, Rosedale and Springfield Gardens neighborhoods by utilizing messengers to mediate conflict on the street and connect high-risk individuals to services that can reduce the long-term risk of violence. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards represented the district on the City Council and celebrated the program coming to the precinct. “The 105th Precinct has one of the largest geographic areas to cover, with nearly 13 square miles and 354 miles of roadway,” Richards said. “It is extremely difficult to maintain the peace in our communities, and many are overwhelmed. Cure Violence expansion into the 105th Precinct is a welcome resource eastern Queens needs, and we need to do everything we can to stop gun violence and invest in our neighborhoods while keeping them safe.” Leaving a seat for those lost to Covid - Forest Park memorial pays tribute to Queens residents who passed May 5 | Queens Chronicle John Walter was 80 when he died last May, one of Queens’ many victims of Covid-19.

The bill , sponsored by Manhattan Council Member Carlina Rivera, codifies and expands upon the initial program that closes streets to through traffic for pedestrian and cyclist use. The program was introduced about a year ago as a temporary measure to provide New Yorkers with adequate outdoor space amid the pandemic. It proved popular in many neighborhoods, garnering particular success on 34th Avenue, an area short of park space. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzáles-Rojas, State Sen. Jessica Ramos, Council Member Daniel Dromm and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards all came out to the rally on 34th Avenue Thursday. Richards called the bill’s passage — and the expansion of the program to communities underserved by it — monumental. “What we’re saying to communities around the city is that you matter,” he said. “That although Robert Moses might have overbuilt your community and didn’t think about park space, we can take back our streets and that’s what we’re doing today.” Workers’ Memorial Day commemorated at Elmhurst Hospital by labor, elected officials April 30 | QNS Elected officials joined labor leaders at Elmhurst Hospital Wednesday for their annual Workers’ Memorial Event to honor those who have died or suffered injuries or illnesses, including COVID-19, while on the job, to recognize the sacrifices made by all essential workers on the frontlines, and to renew the fight for strong safety and health protections. Elmhurst Hospital became known nationally as the “epicenter of the epicenter” when it became overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients at the height of the pandemic just over a year ago. “Why did we see particular neighborhoods hit harder than others across Queens County?” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said. “The answer is simple. There were those who could stay home and there were those who were essential workers and we know that many of our essential workers from this neighborhood down to the Rockaways and throughout southeast Queens who drive the city could not stay home. These are the workers that drive our economy.” Donovan’s Plan to Support Immigrants Get vaxxed?

The residents of this community… deserve to be able to go out about their business without dodging bullets,” Richards said. Queens Community Gathers To Condemn Gun Violence After Recent Shootings March 25 | CBS News DONOVAN RICHARDS, JR .: Over the course of the last two or three weeks, we've seen these streets turned into a war zone.

MTA Eyes Commuter Rails as Discount Subways Substitutes With Crowds Expected Back March 26 | The City “We don’t need to see the E train at capacity, we’re trying to stop the spread,” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards told THE CITY. “So the commuter trains can relieve some of that pressure.” The MTA is exploring ways to increase the number of passengers at commuter rail stations in Queens, Brooklyn and Bronx neighborhoods that lack easy access to the subway.

Queens borough president urges JetBlue to remain in Long Island City March 25 | QNS Queens Borough President Donovan Richards is calling on New York’s “hometown airline” to stay grounded in Long Island City. In a letter to JetBlue CEO Robin Harris, Richards urged the company to commit to keeping its corporate headquarters in Queensboro Plaza instead of moving its operation to Florida. “When JetBlue initially chose Kew Gardens and later Long Island City as the site of its corporate headquarters, it marked the beginning of what has become a deep and mutually-beneficial partnership between your airline and the borough of Queens,” Richards wrote. “Let’s continue that partnership. I understand the COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant strains on JetBlue and other airlines, and that emerging from the nadir will require difficult choices. But I know that it would be a long-term mistake for JetBlue to abandon its relationships and roots in Queens, thereby losing out on everything our borough and its residents can offer.” Anti-gun violence rally in Queens after pair of deadly shootings March 26 | ABC News WOODSIDE, Queens (WABC) -- Officials in Queens held a press conference Thursday calling for the urgent need to address a recent surge in gun violence across the borough.

The $2.9 million project was funded by $493,000 from Mayor Bill de Blasio, $1 million from Council Member Constantinides, and $1.5 million from former Queens Borough President Melinda Katz. STATEMENT ON Possible JETBLUE Relocation I was disappointed to learn JetBlue is reportedly considering relocating its headquarters from Long Island City to Florida. I am urging JetBlue’s corporate leadership to reassess those plans and to commit to staying in Queens. When JetBlue initially chose Kew Gardens and later Long Island City as the site of its corporate headquarters, it marked the beginning of what has become a deep and mutually-beneficial partnership between your airline and the borough of Queens. Let’s continue that partnership. I understand the COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant strains on JetBlue and other airlines, and that emerging from the nadir will require difficult choices. But I know that it would be a long-term mistake for JetBlue to abandon its relationships and roots in Queens, thereby losing out on everything our borough and its residents can offer. As Borough President, I am committed to building an environment in Queens that allows businesses—large and small— to adapt, grow, and thrive. I ask that JetBlue’s leadership meet with me soon to discuss what can be done to keep JetBlue’s headquarters in Long Island City, and I hope that one day soon we’ll be able to celebrate the renewal of our partnership.

We know he will work with the incoming mayor to advocate for the needs of our members and retirees in Queens...” March 17 | Twitter @ Angacevedo15 March 17 | Twitter @ Dean_Moses ‘Not going to be tolerated’: Queens borough president talks rise in anti-Asian hate crimes Friday, March 18 | PIX11 The rise in attacks against Asian Americans has been felt across New York City, particularly the borough of Queens, where more than 25% of residents identify as Asian.

Demand More Vaccine Sites In Corona March 17, 2021 | Queens Gazette Assemblymembers Catalina Cruz, Jeffrion Aubry, Jessica González-Rojas, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards , and local community groups called upon Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio to increase the number of vaccination sites in the neighborhood of Corona. Corona possesses one of the lowest COVID-19 immunization rates in the five boroughs, despite being one of the most populous neighborhoods in the city. Only three vaccination sites exist to serve over 83,000 residents, with only two sites offering second doses at this time. Hurdles in obtaining vaccination appointments and registration difficulties have also contributed to the staggeringly low rates. At the onset of the pandemic, Corona – and the adjacent neighborhoods of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst – earned the nickname “the epicenter of the epicenter” of the COVID-19 pandemic due to high infection and death rates in the region. The makeup of the district largely consists of low-income essential workers in the construction, restaurant, and healthcare sectors. Due to demands for in-person manual labor, the majority of these employees do not have the option to work remotely and face repeated exposure to the general public. Because of economic restraints and lack of affordable housing, low-income families in the area must often house multiple generations in a single apartment, making social distancing measures recommended by the CDC nearly impossible. These factors – along with lack of access to affordable healthcare and preventative medicine – have contributed to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic last year in Black and Brown communities such as Corona. PIX11 part of monthly program to get Queens residents back to work beginning with online job fair Wednesday, March 16 | PIX11 Queens Borough President Donovan Richards has been looking for a way to get his borough back to work since the coronavirus pandemic devastated the local economy last year.

King Singh, 7, and Mesiah Singh, 6, who are from Queens Village, were both born with a rare blood disease called glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD). G6PD causes red blood cells to break down in response to certain medications, infections or other stressors. There is no cure for this disease, so the only lifesaving treatment is a blood transfusion when the red cells break down from a trigger, according to New York Blood Center. JFK, LGA workers open bargaining for contract renewal March 4, 2021 | QNS Elected bargaining committees representing more than 10,000 majority Black and immigrant workers at JFK, LaGuardia and Newark airports and 32BJ SEIU members met employers virtually Thursday, March 4, in the first sessions for contract renewals. The unit is the largest group of airport workers to start bargaining since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to lead the nationwide conversation on essential worker safety and recovery in the coronavirus era. “Queens is the gateway to the rest of the country and the world because of our airports, and there are many workers of color who regularly face systemic racial inequalities, which have been heightened by this pandemic,” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said. “We need to ensure our airport workers have a voice on the job to fight for security, dignity, and respect. A strong contract for thousands of airport workers of color is a crucial step toward justice and equity. Our borough fully supports the hardworking staff of JFK and LaGuardia airports.” Donovan Richards: Every  Neighborhood In Queens Deserves A Connected Bike Network March 4, 2021 | Streetsblog Don’t tell this borough president, “No one bikes in your neighborhood.” Queens Beep Donovan Richards laid out an ambitious, aggressive transportation agenda in his 2021 State of the Borough, an agenda that focuses heavily on creating a safe and humane transportation system that benefits every inch of the city’s largest borough (and also positions him nicely for re-election). “Enough is enough, lives are on the line with every change of a traffic light,” Richards said in the first of what he hopes will become yearly addresses. St. John’s Hospital in Far Rockaway gets a reprieve March 5, 2020 | Long Island Herald Outside St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway at a news conference turned pep rally on March 5, elected and hospital officials announced that the medical facility that was being pressured by the New York State Department of Health to become  a 15-bed “micro hospital” the plan has stalled. “I’m happy to say based on the work of all us coming together, and that means our elected  officials who came together when we got the news, including the staff of St. John’s, and most importantly you the community, because of you we have got a reprieve on keeping St. John’s Hospital open,” said Queens Borough President Donovan Richards , to applause and cheers. Richards calls for boroughwide bike network in State of Borough speech March 4, 2021 | Queens Chronicle Borough President Donovan Richards ripped the city’s transportation system during his first State of the Borough address Wednesday. “For millions of us, no matter how we get around, not a day goes by where the system does not fail us,” he said. Richards said that could mean being late for work or fatalities, including the 25 pedestrians, 33 motorists and one cyclist killed in 2020. 2021 State of the Borough Address United Against Hate Feb 24, 2021 | Queens Gazette Standing united with elected officials, community leaders, faith leaders and law enforcement, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards hosted a press conference Monday on the steps of Queens Borough Hall to “categorically condemn the troubling rise in bias crimes, especially against our Asian American and Jewish communities, both in recent weeks and over the past year,” Richards said. Below are some of Borough President Richards’ remarks, as prepared for delivery: “I want to thank all our friends in the press for being here today — at the People’s House — to discuss a virus that has been in our midst long before COVID-19 came to town. That virus is called hate. “Like COVID-19, it hit our minority communities hard last spring — especially our Asian American communities — only to seemingly slide back into the shadows until this month’s second wave. That couldn’t be further from the truth. It might not have been making headlines, but this plague of prejudice is still running much too rampant, just like it’s been for generations. Queens Community Board Applications See 56-Percent Jump Feb 22, 2021 | Forest Hills Patch KEW GARDENS, QUEENS — A record number of people applied to serve on one of Queens' 14 community boards this year, according to the borough president's office. The office received 931 applications from newcomers and current board members seeking reappointment — a borough record, and an increase of more than 56 percent from the 595 applications submitted last year, a spokesperson said. That includes nearly 700 people who are not currently members of a community board, compared to 252 last year. "Democracy works best when it hears the voices of all the people it serves," Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said. "Having a community board membership that truly reflects the diversity in Queens will help ensure our City government hears what our borough's residents have to say." Queens Lawmakers Gather on Steps of Borough Hall to Denounce Spike in Hate Crimes Feb 22, 2021 | Sunnyside Post Queens lawmakers and community leaders joined together on the steps of Borough Hall Monday to denounce a recent string of hate crimes against the Asian American and Jewish communities in the borough. The press conference was organized by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards following three bias incidents in the borough this month. Two Asian woman were attacked and a swastika was drawn on a Rego Park synagogue last Tuesday. “For even just one of these incidents to occur here in Queens, the most diverse county in America, is an affront to everything we represent,” Richards said at Borough Hall. “But for three to happen in [two] weeks, on top of everything our borough has been through over the past year? It’s time to stand up and say ‘enough.’” One-on-One with Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Feb 19, 2021 | NY1 Queens Borough President Donovan Richards is constantly on the move. On the morning he caught up with NY1, the 36-year-old Richards joined two business ribbon-cutting ceremonies in Jamaica. He’d visited a pop-up vaccination site in South Richmond Hill, attended a Lunar New Year celebration by JFK airport, and all before lunch. As Queens Borough President, a lot of people are counting on him to succeed.  Not only because of the things they want done in the borough, but because they relate to Richards, being that he’s the first black man to ever hold the office. “It’s been surreal to achieve this monumental and historic victory in becoming the first black man to be the borough president in Queens,” Richards said. He said there’s never a dull moment. “I know that being the first, there’s always a big responsibility and you know you have to get it right,” Richards said.

JOBS AND SMALL BUSINESSES This pandemic has not only affected our health and well-being, it also led us into a financial crisis and impacted our economic development. There is no other way to say it — we are living through an economic pandemic, causing a crisis rivaled only by the Great Depression nearly a century ago. Nine straight months of double-digit unemployment in Queens, peaking at over twenty-one percent last summer. Hundreds of small businesses, the heartbeats of our communities, closed, many of them women- and minority-owned. Thousands more only survive on the margins — each week bringing new challenges and new threats to their very existence. To support small business, immediate assistance for our vast network of entrepreneurs, especially those who have been overlooked and underserved for generations. As Borough President, I have a five point plan to support small businesses and create jobs in Queens. This includes: Virtual guides on navigating the maze that is securing PPP loans.

--- 3rd Level Page: https://www.richardsforqueens.com/housing-for-all ---
housing for all For far too many Housing in New York City is increasingly unaffordable.The economic crisis sparked by the pandemic further exacerbated our already escalating housing crisis. I’ll get straight to the point: we need to increase the money in emergency relief set aside for both tenants and landlords. If we do not take these measures, we will surely have more homeless tenants. But let’s not forget here in Queens many of our 2-or-3 family homes are owner occupied. Without relief many of them are at risk of losing their properties. That is their American dream and we cannot allow this crisis to steal it from them. Yes, there are some scrupulous landlords out there and I will work with the Public Advocate and city agencies to root them out. But so many of our landlords have great relationships with their tenants and want to support their tenants. Let us not pit our communities against each other.If there are landlords out there who think now is the time to push out their long time residents, well my office is here to make sure that just does not happen on my watch So let us give the aid to those that need it regardless of whether they owe back rent or on their mortgage. The housing crisis requires both new building and repurposing, it is multi-layered. Regardless we need the creation of more affordable housing, more senior housing, and more veterans housing. There is just no way around it and as our population continues to age that need will continue to grow. We must also support, protect and develop plans to once and for all improve the quality of life in our boroughs public housing. I am ready to use my authority to guide re-zonings earlier in the process so we ensure real affordable housing and address the following key priorities: Creation of at least two thousand, truly new affordable housing unite for our seniors Creation of at least two thousand, truly new affordable housing unite for our seniors Ensure that all new developments are sustainable and work to finally achieve the greening of all city-owned sites in Queens Ensure that all new developments are sustainable and work to finally achieve the greening of all city-owned sites in Queens Find new locations for senior housing, including the potential of city-owned sites currently in use for other purposes or vacant land and parking lots Find new locations for senior housing, including the potential of city-owned sites currently in use for other purposes or vacant land and parking lots Forster the growth of supportive housing for our veterans. Forster the growth of supportive housing for our veterans. As for our public housing, I created a working group of New York City Housing Authority Tenant Association Presidents to ensure frequent communication between NYCHA residents and my office. Let me be perfectly clear This is a working group intended not just to improve communication but to get things done Under my direction, my office is reviewing capital procedures at NYCHA for sustainability. We must start addressing our housing crisis with our finances, our zoning changes, out broader housing policy and our partnerships with the state and federal government not to mention the private sector. If we do not change, we will have an unprecedented amount of people in our borough who are housing insecure. We cannot let this happen. It is our current President, Joe Biden, who said, “Don’t tell me what you care about, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you care about.” Part of addressing affordable housing means promoting affordable homeownership. I am calling on the city to work with the federal government to purchase foreclosed homes and working with our non-profit organizations to refurbish them and provide affordable  opportunities to first time home buyers. Years ago, I led efforts in the City Council to pass legislation so we fund Community Land Trusts. We must double our investment in CLTs to give communities control over their land and keep housing affordable. By boosting our housing, we enhance our neighborhoods. Immediate relief for our current residents, producing more affordable units for all our vulnerable communities, protecting and investing in our public housing stock, and promoting home ownership, we have a plan.

SUPPORTING IMMIGRANTS Queens is one of the most diverse places in the world, with hundreds of languages spoken here. Nearly half of the Queens population is born outside of the United States and that’s why I’m committed to rolling out the welcome mat for our newest New Yorkers. I am committed to supporting our immigrant communities. That is why my office will soon officially open the Immigrant Welcome Center, the first in any borough. The Immigrant Welcome Center will serve as a hub, a one stop shop of sorts, for our immigrant communities. All are welcome, and we will never ask about immigration status at my office. Queens is no place for ICE. Not in our courts not in our housing developments, and not in our schools.  We will provide the resources necessary for those who find themselves in immigration court to fight back. I’ll ensure that funding continues to provide legal services to all undocumented immigrants and stand up against attempts by the federal government that discourage immigrants from accessing our justice system.

Transportation We must ensure that our neighborhoods are accessible, which means addressing transportation while addressing housing. Transportation is what connects us to everything and everyone. And for millions of us, no matter how we get around, not a day goes by where the system does not fail us. Sometimes, it means being late for work. But for far too many families, it means a funeral. So the safety of our streets will always be a top priority of my office. We owe that much to the 25 pedestrians, 33 motorists, and 1 cyclist who lost their lives on our roads last year alone. We are sick of hearing how Northern Boulevard has become the new Boulevard of Death. I’m tired of hearing excuses year after year about why the redesign of Queens Boulevard STILL isn’t done. Enough is enough. Lives are on the line with every change of a traffic light. It’s time to reimagine how we get around our borough, and I’ve got some ideas. We can transform our bike network into a borough-wide interconnected web for all our families to safely enjoy. This means engaging our cycling community, directing capital dollars to redesign our streets, and making the bicycle a legitimate mode of transportation, no matter what neighborhood you call home. You should be able to ride from Forest Hills to the Flushing Bay Promenade or pedal from Glendale to Glen Oaks without fear. And for our cyclists who want to take in the views from the Queensboro Bridge, we’re just as excited as you are to see a bike lane in the works. But we can still think bigger. Let’s encourage multi-modal transportation by building a network of bike storage hubs outside our subway stations. Let’s bring scooter sharing to Queens, and especially the Rockaways, unlocking even more interest in our beaches and our businesses along the peninsula. Let’s speed up Citi Bike’s rollout across Queens. There’s no reason why Eastern Queens should be years behind the rest of the borough. Let’s open more of our bridges to cyclists, establish a true Five- Borough Bikeway and make Queens even more accessible to those beyond our borders. For those who rely on mass transit, you deserve nothing less than an efficient, reliable commute. But for Southeast Queens and Northeast Queens, and other transportation deserts across this borough, we have no idea what that even looks like. This is the administration that is commited to making fantasy a reality. Our plan includes: Busways along center medians with all-door boarding, speeding up commutes and making our commercial corridors more accessible, starting with Archer Avenue in Jamaica.

And MTA, yes, we need more community input in the planning process – true community input. But while we’re talking rails, enough messing around with Southeast Queens. The Long Island Rail Road’s Atlantic Ticket program must be made permanent with a free subway transfer. We will accept nothing less. Let us also demand that the Biden-Harris Administration allow us to proceed with congestion pricing, which has the potential to create a billion dollar revenue stream that would be a game changer for the MTA. The possibilities for transportation improvements that could be funded by this revenue stream are endless. For our pedestrians, our streets belong as much to you as anyone else. It’s time our policies reflect that. We must expand our Open Streets program. Together with the Department of Transportation, we will develop a plan that does not rely so heavily on community volunteers.  As we expand, we must prioritize schools and communities lacking green space alike. Let’s work with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and the Street Vendor Project to fast-track licenses for food vendors. If we’re going to be socially distancing from one another for the foreseeable future, let’s optimize these spaces the ways we know we can. As the largest borough in New York, with a land area of one hundred nine square miles, we need safe and affordable transportation infrastructure that meets our needs down to the last mile. It’s about time we got what we deserved, so let’s get to work. stay in touch RichardsForQueens@gmail.com Paid for by Friends Of Donovan Richards Info Meet Donovan Issues Video Action Volunteer Contact Donate Action Kit

COMMUNITY BOARD REFORM Community boards are the heartbeat of our democracy. They are the core of our civic infrastructure. But we need to bring our borough’s community boards into the future.  Our belief in the human capital of Queens calls for involving more residents into the process. We know the more of us who participate, the more likely we are to have success. That is why we have begun transforming our community boards because we know they are vital to ensuring we vigilantly protect and improve our quality-of-life. Community board members consistently have been crucial voices at the table. They are the “small d” democratic institutions, letting community members have a voice in the decisions that shape their neighborhoods. We are thankful to the community leaders who volunteer their time to advance the neighborhoods they love. But in order for us to excel at greater heights, these boards need to better reflect the diversity of the neighborhoods they serve. If you have ever attended a community board meeting, you know there needs to be a makeover from top to bottom. My office is spearheading several reforms that will not only empower the borough’s boards but will help deliver a level of transparency we desperately need. That is why I am prioritizing four areas. Board Diversity and Representation Board Diversity and Representation Member Conduct Member Conduct Public Engagement and Open Meetings Public Engagement and Open Meetings The Modernization of Board Bylaws The Modernization of Board Bylaws We deserve community board that reflect the people of Queens. I am committed to finally having our board memberships reflect the diversity of our borough’s population.

HEALTHCARE ACCESS The Coronavirus has exposed the disparity in our health care delivery system. Queens was the hardest borough and was woefully unprepared to face the crisis. In a borough with 2.4 million people, we have just nine hospital campuses. Just in the last twelve years, four of our hospitals have closed, removing more than 840 beds and thousands of medical professionals and leaving communities like Far Rockaway with even less access to healthcare. To accept this as normal would be to accept that Queens don’t matter. That is why my administration is going to fight with the same zeal of our healthcare heroes to greatly expand access to healthcare — especially in communities that have long felt the sting of inequity. This means pushing for more community-based health centers, offering preventative medicine and keeping non-emergencies out of our crowded emergency rooms. And it means advocating for new hospital construction and increasing funding to our existing hospitals — which are already doing so much with far less than they need. We need to think big and act bold. Let’s make sure that if and when another pandemic Queens is prepared, we won’t be overwhelmed the way we were last year. Let’s get to work. stay in touch RichardsForQueens@gmail.com Paid for by Friends Of Donovan Richards Info Meet Donovan Issues Video Action Volunteer Contact Donate Action Kit
