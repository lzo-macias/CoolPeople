      here is how this would be done. Important: No " " required. Must have "()" around contributor name. No spaces after ":" Notes You can try constructing a search query and hitting "Search" in the top "Advanced Search" section
      and then coming "back" to this section to copy that query into the "Query:" box. "downloads" is the number of downloads for content in an item "month" is the number of downloads in the last 30 days "week" is the number of downloads in the last 7 days We have a known bug in our site with using " TO " in things like titles/descriptions .
      If you run into a problem and need to use " TO ",
      use it lowercase and you will avoid this bug.

Then, after it takes a while, I get a âfailedâ notification, at least thatâs what itâs been doing lately. Like most everyone else, I donât quite understand the purpose of this app. Iâm saving pages for the heck of it but donât see how the app is supposed to help me enjoy them. In addition, itâs buggy. Youâd think that a great and essential website such as the archive, our main keepers of web history, would offer an app up to par with it but thatâs not the case here at all.   fydvn , Confusing The Internet Archive app was and still is difficult for me to navigate. For example, after finding a particular show on Google that led me to the archives, and so I created an account. At that time I was able to watch what I had found and add it to âmy favoritesâ. Later on, I downloaded the app. I tried logging in, and it said that I have an account but âmy favoritesâ arenât there. Thereâs no option to find them either. However, I have google on my fire stick and was able to access it there, along with my favorites. So, itâs very confusing. As with other reviewers, I agree there should be other input options other than only being able to use the URL. Also, 2 days after having âmy favoritesâ saved and able to watch a few, as of today, thereâs a video error and those âfilesâ will no longer play. None of them and I canât âfavoriteâ them either. I donât know what kind of glitch that is, but I believe Iâd you work out those minor âbugsâ, the app would be great. Not too shabby for now though, great start.   Yowzoe , 5 â­ï¸ potential, but...ð¤ please updateâ¼ï¸ The Archive has enough talented admirers to improve the two IA apps. Improving them is long overdue. Everyone loves the Internet Archive and the incredible effort that goes into it. It's indispensable for students and lovers of knowledge the world over. It greatly expands access to knowledge and keeps liars at bay with the truth of original sources. It's obviously a labor of love. Thank you! It's time to level up your two apps, time to make them world-class.

Internet Archive Blogs A blog from the team at archive.org Blog Announcements archive.org About Events Developers Donate New Digital Collection Preserves Key Books on Drug Use and Policy Posted on April 22, 2025 by Caralee Adams For many years, the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) maintained a large library of books on drug use and policy at its New York City headquarters. As researchers shifted to working online, DPA’s Jules Netherland said she noticed fewer people coming into the office to use the collection. “It became clear if we really wanted people to benefit from our resources that digitization was the way to go,” said Netherland, managing director of the Alliance’s Department of Research and Academic Engagement. It was also an opportunity to add to the growing collection of the Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists (SALIS). DPA donated its book collection to the Internet Archive to be digitized and made available for lending and for the print disabled. A team was sent to New York to pick up the books, which were packaged onto three pallets and shipped to a facility for scanning and storage. Now, the digital version of the DPA library, with 2,260 items, is available to the public at https://archive.org/details/dpa . It is part of the larger SALIS collection of 8,647 items on alcohol and substance abuse digitized by SALIS. Browse the new Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) collection: https://archive.org/details/dpa The new donation covers books on a range of subjects going back to the 1900s, said Liz Rosenberg, donations manager for the Internet Archive. There are volumes on historical and cultural analysis of drug use, policy and politics around drugs, pharmacological studies, and books specific to a particular drug. Titles now digitized include: Deadly medicine: Indians and alcohol in early America ; Between prohibition and legalization : the Dutch experiment in drug policy ; Pain, analgesia, and addiction: the pharmacologic treatment of pain ; and Meth wars : police, media, power . The public has responded with curiosity. In January, 10,000 items were accessed in the digitized collection. Rosenberg speculates the audience is likely researchers, historians, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Resource guide developed for the collection. In the rapidly evolving field of drug policy, which spans many disciplines, Netherland said it’s important to provide evidence-based information to the public. The hope is to enhance advocacy efforts with easier access to the organization’s collection. DPA developed a resource guide to encourage its use on the Internet Archive. In donating its collection, DPA helped build the Internet Archive’s SALIS collection. Since 2008, SALIS has helped preserve thousands of items from physical libraries with research from drug and alcohol fields that have closed, said Andrea Mitchell, SALIS executive director. About 30 years ago, there were approximately 95 libraries, clearinghouses, and resource centers around the world devoted to collecting, cataloguing, and disseminating information concerning alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, Mitchell said. However, today the majority of those  libraries  or databases have closed. The U.S. government has also shut down collections, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse, whose library went back to 1935. “We’re losing important resources and knowledge,” Mitchell said. This leaves a void in access that has been filled, in part, by digitized collections online. Mitchell said The SALIS Collection includes materials that go back to 1774 and books from medicine, sociology, psychology, economics, law and policy, criminal justice, and other fields. In addition to books, there are government documents, grey literature, and newsletters. The DPA collection was one of the larger libraries in the U.S., Mitchell said, and its donation to the Internet Archive is significant and welcome. The Internet Archive is interested in receiving more curated collections like DPA’s on specific subject matters, Rosenberg added. “These really valuable books for research and resources are often not preserved when funding is lost at the library that houses them,” she saidTo find out more about the physical item donation process, go to the Help page for details.

Leave a reply Leave a reply Take Action: Defend the Internet Archive Posted on April 17, 2025 by Chris Freeland The Internet Archive needs your help. A coalition of major record labels has filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive—demanding $700 million for our work preserving and providing access to historical 78rpm records. These fragile, obsolete discs hold some of the earliest recordings of a vanishing American culture. But this lawsuit goes far beyond old records. It’s an attack on the Internet Archive itself. This lawsuit is an existential threat to the Internet Archive and everything we preserve—including the Wayback Machine , a cornerstone of memory and preservation on the internet. At a time when digital information is disappearing, being rewritten, or erased entirely, the tools to preserve history must be defended—not dismantled. This isn’t just about music. It’s about whether future generations will have access to knowledge, history, and culture. Sign our open letter and tell the record labels to drop their lawsuit.

Community Webs advances the capacity of community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories. San Francisco History Center (SFHC) of the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) is the official archive for the City and County of San Francisco. SFHC serves all library users and levels of interest, from the merely curious to those engaging in scholarly research. Because of the Center’s archival function, it also administers the archival collections of the James C. Hormel LGBTQIA Center . Internet Archive has supported our work to preserve and provide access to San Francisco’s history in many ways. Since 2007, Internet Archive has hosted SFPL digitized content, including local documents and city directories . In 2017, SFPL became one of the first members of Internet Archive’s Community Webs program. This program has provided us with the tools we need to preserve local web-based content that will be important for future researchers investigating San Francisco’s history. In 2023, the Community Webs program was awarded a grant from the National Historical Publication and Records Commission for the “Collaborative Access to Diverse Public Library Local History Collections” project . This grant supported the digitization of local history collections from libraries across the country, including SFPL. With this support, 23 bound volumes of a Chinese/English language newspaper East/West and 4 cartons of oral histories from the Paul Radin Papers were digitized by Internet Archive. Cover of East/West, 1968, Vol. 2, no. 23 East/West The East/West (Dong xi bao) newspaper was acquired the easy way – original subscription by the SFPL’s Periodical Department in the late 1960s. There are only a handful of institutions that have East/West in their holdings as microfilm only. SFHC has the complete run in paper format. In late 1966, Gordon Lew and two Chinese newspaper colleagues, Kenneth Joe and Ken Wong, began the idea of East/West , a bilingual weekly newspaper published out of San Francisco’s Chinatown. The inaugural issue was in January 1967 and the newspaper ran for over twenty-two years with the last issue in September 1989. Lew became the publisher and editor, Joe worked in the Chinese section, and Wong was the principal writer in the English section. East/West was an important community newspaper, with extensive coverage of local Chinatown news, social activities, the work of Chinese American political figures, and international developments such as the normalization of China ties. East/West was published in English and Chinese, and for many years, the two sections had approximately the same number of pages. The editorial and perhaps the main news article in the English section would be translated into Chinese. The Chinese section tended to focus more on culture, arts, and history, and it often reprinted articles from other sources. Advertisements filled both sections from the very beginning for local businesses and services. Most were community ads as the newspaper served non-profit organizations that arose in the wake of the Chinese American and Asian American empowerment movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Miss Chinatown, East/West, 1977, Vol. 11, no. 9, p. 14 Researchers and scholars of 20 th -century Chinese American communities in the United States will appreciate the online availability of this unique resource. Many important issues cropped up in Chinese America and Asian America starting in the late 1960s and these can be found in East/West from the community perspective. By being a bilingual publication, the newspaper captured and shared the voice of the community. In addition, San Francisco Chinese Americans had limited political power in the 1960s. East/West focused on emerging Chinese American political figures and urged the community to increase its voting and general political participation. Browse East/West on archive.org Paul Radin Papers In 2003, the Paul Radin Papers were donated to the SFHC by Professor Luis S. Kemnitzer of San Francisco State University on behalf of Calvin Fast Wolf and Mary Sacharoff-Fast Wolf. Mary Wolf was a would-be biographer of Radin who had acquired original papers from her friend and Radin’s widow, Doris Woodward Radin, as well as colleagues. Dr. Paul Radin (1883-1959) is considered to be one of the formative influences in contemporary anthropology and ethnography in the United States and Europe. The bulk of the Paul Radin Papers consists of surveys from Radin’s supervision of over 200 workers who interviewed ethnic groups in the San Francisco Bay Area for the State Emergency Relief Administration of California (SERA) over a period of nine months in 1934-1935. Known as SERA project 2-F2-98 (3-F2-145), its abstract was published in 1935 as The Survey of San Francisco’s Minorities: Its Purpose and Results . The stated purpose was a cultural survey to find employment for “white collar” unemployed workers on temporary relief. Radin’s focus was “to study the steps in the adjustment and assimilation of minority groups in San Francisco and Alameda counties.” Bypassing a typical questionnaire method, Radin instead had the amateur interviewers record anything and everything which the interviewees wished to say. The results appear in a narrative format—sometimes in the form of poetry and short stories—and encompass all manner of immigrant experiences. Survey materials include typed and handwritten interviews and research on ethnic groups. Some interviewers identify themselves, and their report appears in their own hand. Jon Y. Lee’s notes, Paul Radin Papers A portion of the Paul Radin Papers includes SERA worker Jon Y. Lee’s papers including material for The Golden Mountain . Lee was the son of Chinese immigrants who settled in Oakland, California. Radin hired Lee as a fieldworker to collect Chinatown traditions in Oakland, California. Today, Lee is recognized as the first Asian American to work professionally as a folklorist. With this collection online, international scholars can now easily access narratives about the immigrant experience from their country/region to assist with their diaspora studies. The typed descriptions allow for OCR discovery and for one to gather more information on the San Francisco immigrant experience in the 1910s and 1920s.

Telderszaal, Academiegebouw (Leiden). Wiki info. The Internet Archive was recently honored for its valuable contribution to the Dutch-language Wikipedia community at an event at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle accepted the 2024 Project Uil award at a March 18 gathering of prominent figures in the Dutch open knowledge movement including librarians, archivists, scholars, and representatives from national cultural institutions. The WikiUilen awards have been given out since 2015 on behalf of the Dutch Wikipedia community in recognition of hardworking Wikipedia volunteers and organizations. Candidates in eight categories (project, writer, editor, newcomer, etc.) are nominated and voted on by fellow Wikipedians. The Internet Archive received the project award and a small replica of an ancient Greek owl sculpture. (“Uilen” in Dutch translates to “owls” in English.) WikiUilen “owls” “The owl is a symbol of wisdom,” said Ronald Velgersdijk, organizer of the Dutch awards, in presenting the statue to Kahle. “We give this project award because the Internet Archive is very important for sharing knowledge and it is very important for Wikimedia. We use it a lot to cite our sources and find information.” In a concerted effort to ground the information ecosystem in facts, Kahle explained how the Internet Archive has prioritized obtaining and digitizing books referenced in Wikipedia. Since 2016, the Internet Archive has identified and fixed more than 22 million broken links in over 200 language editions of Wikipedia. By pointing readers back to archived web pages in the Wayback Machine and digital books available online, the aim is to increase the credibility of Wikipedia with reliable links and sources, he said. “The partnership between Wikipedia and the Internet Archive is very strong and growing,” Kahle said. Watch the Wiki Owl presentation to Internet Archive Jos Damen, a librarian at Leiden University, helped host the event, which drew nearly 100 attendees. An advocate of open access publishing and a Dutch Wikipedian with over 1 million edits, Damen said he admires the work of the Internet Archive and leans on its resources. “First and foremost of value is the presence of websites in the Wayback Machine,” Damen said. “As librarians, we all know that links that you access now will be gone in two to five years. It’s important to see these links frozen in time in the Wayback Machine, and then being able to have that reference in Wikipedia.” Damen said it’s critical to not only fix links to books, but also to add images and attribution for photos on Wikipedia. For instance, a photograph of small copper stones in the pavement in several European countries, signifying the last place where Jewish people lived before they were taken to concentration camps, is a powerful image that can make a page more engaging, he said. (See Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein ) Kahle’s remarks covered the history, evolving support, and challenges facing libraries. He spoke about the mission of the Internet Archive to provide universal access to all knowledge, and gave an overview of Internet Archive Europe – which has a somewhat different focus. “The idea [of Internet Archive Europe] is to try to build our collective intelligence using all sorts of interesting tools so we can have better decision making,” Kahle said.

Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle accepted the 2024 Project Uil award at a March 18 gathering of prominent figures in the Dutch open knowledge movement including librarians, archivists, scholars, and representatives from national cultural institutions. The WikiUilen awards have been given out since 2015 on behalf of the Dutch Wikipedia community in recognition of hardworking Wikipedia volunteers and organizations. Candidates in eight categories (project, writer, editor, newcomer, etc.) are nominated and voted on by fellow Wikipedians. The Internet Archive received the project award and a small replica of an ancient Greek owl sculpture. (“Uilen” in Dutch translates to “owls” in English.) “The owl is a symbol of wisdom,” said Ronald Velgersdijk, organizer of the Dutch awards, in presenting the statue to Kahle. “We give this project award because the Internet Archive is very important for sharing knowledge and it is very important for Wikimedia. We use it a lot to cite our sources and find information.” In a concerted effort to ground the information ecosystem in facts, Kahle explained how the Internet Archive has prioritized obtaining and digitizing books referenced in Wikipedia.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. Like many in the early days of Instagram, Allie Alvis shared what they had for dinner or funny things they encountered on their personal account. It was in Edinburgh, Scotland, when pursuing their master’s degree in book history that they were inspired to post about the university’s incredible book collection, library and items from the used and antiquarian bookshop where they worked. “To my surprise, people really, really enjoyed it,” said Alvis, of videos and photos they curated of delicately paging through rare books. “I started getting questions from friends and family. And then it just sort of picked up steam with institutions and bookish colleagues following me. I have no idea how I ended up at 255,000 followers now.” The self-described “pink-haired book historian” mainly posts on Instagram ( @Book_Historia ), but also is active on TikTok, X, Bluesky, Tumblr, Threads and Facebook. Alvis aims to share something new at least once a week, in addition to working as curator of special collections at the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library in Winterthur, Delaware. Alvis said they never set out to become a super popular influencer, but they enjoy sharing their passion for rare books and educating the public. “It’s been a crazy ride that my followers have grown to such an extent,” they said. “It really has been a grand experiment.” Among the most popular items they’ve recently shared: a French sample book of foil ornaments from the late 19th century. “It’s just delicious—sparkly, metal. It’s just to die for,” they said. Alvis’s posts are filled with descriptive narration and an authentic reverence for the historic books they present. They maintain that there’s more to a rare book than what’s on its pages. There’s history behind the author who wrote it, the place where it was made, and the materials used to make it. Allie Alvis Check out Allie Alvis on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/book_historia “Because that history remains, you want to preserve it,” Alvis said. “You want to keep it in the best possible condition so other people can learn from it.” Having materials online means that people from all parts of the world can view them without having to travel, which is good for the environment. It’s also useful in knowledge sharing and teaching to have access from beyond your local library, said Alvis, who has a bachelor’s degree in linguistics from the University of Kansas, a master’s of science in book history at the University of Edinburgh and master’s of science in information management from the University of Glasgow. “I approach digital initiatives from an access standpoint,” Alvis said. “I love that digitization and the Internet Archive gives more people access to materials—and that helps to preserve it.” Whether putting together scholarly articles or a social media post, Alvis turns to many sources in their research—including the Internet Archive. They especially appreciate the ephemeral material that it has preserved, digitized and made freely available, along with the vast collection of books. “I have my library reference books at home and in the office, but sometimes that one book you need that one page from is just out of reach,” Alvis said. “The short-time lending option on the Internet Archive has saved me so many times.” Download the complete Vanishing Culture report. In their work curating decorative arts and art history, some objects are easier to capture through scanning than others. For example, it can be challenging for digital preservation to reflect the dimensionality of button samples, metal ornaments, or perfume labels. But it is useful with wallpaper samples or other flat objects. There are also limits because of the sheer volume of material and limited resources. Alvis said librarians, academics, booksellers, and book collectors are embracing digitization and social media as tools to both further knowledge and highlight collections. Many also now understand that access is an important part of preservation. “It would be amazing if everything could be scanned—but there is just so much of it,” Alvis said. Still, as a librarian, Alvis said, much has been saved—and for that, they’re thankful: “It is only because previous generations have preserved this material—to the extent that they have—that I have work.” Posted in Books Archive , News | Tagged vanishingculture | 2 Replies Vanishing Culture: When Preservation Meets Social Media by Caralee Adams Caralee Adams The following discussion between writer Caralee Adams and book historian Allie Alvis is part of our Vanishing Culture series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age.

Libraries, now more than ever, need innovative, dedicated champions to help them meet the needs of the public in the digital age. Internet Archive’s Lila Bailey said she sees hope in the talents of Georgetown University law students working at the school’s Intellectual Property and Information Policy Clinic (iPIP). Bailey, Internet Archive’s senior policy counsel, was the keynote speaker at iPIP’s fifth anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C., on March 27. She praised the clinic for providing quality research and creative work products on projects that have helped the Internet Archive promote awareness of the public domain, controlled digital lending, and other issues related to the public interest mission of libraries at a challenging time. “Libraries are at the forefront of using technologies of the day to serve the informational needs of their communities. And they do it without trying to sell you anything, and without selling any data about you either,” Bailey said. “Right now, libraries—whether they are digital, or brick and mortar—are under threat.” Between moves to ban books, defund institutions, and dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services, libraries are facing perilous times. Publishers have simply stopped selling digital books to libraries, forcing them to use commercial platforms that come with terms and conditions that restrict how those materials may be used, Bailey explained. The iPIP clinic had a hand in drafting a paper on the topic, she noted, called, “The Publisher Playbook.” Today, libraries need lawyers, yet most don’t have in-house counsel, Bailey said. That makes the contributions of student law clinics so vital at this juncture. “Clinics play an important role in the library and public interest tech community by expanding our capacity to tackle these existential threats and to pursue opportunities for positive changes,” Bailey said. “[iPIP’s Founder] Amanda Levendowski has built a truly outstanding clinical program in these five short years.” Bailey explained under copyright law, a library can lend out a book it owns to as many people as it wants to, for as long as it wants to. It can also preserve a book for the long term, and make it available long past when a publisher may sell it. The law also allows libraries to make copies of a book in an accessible format for patrons who are blind or have other print-disabilities, and participate in interlibrary loan arrangements, so that patrons of other libraries can access books they don’t have in their own collections. Yet, Bailey said, under these licensing models with publishers, none of those practices is allowed. “These market-based threats are a completely new kind of challenge that require creative legal and policy interventions,” Bailey said. In her remarks, Bailey described how her interest in the field began nearly twenty years ago when she chose to go to law school at University of California Berkeley, in part because of its Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic. “[The internet] was new. I was optimistic to democratize access to information and saw it as a revolutionary force,” she said. Bailey’s first client at the clinic was the Internet Archive, working on a project that would eventually become the TV News Archive. She later became a teaching fellow at the clinic, and joined the Internet Archive staff in 2017. Since iPIP’s first semester in 2020, Bailey said she has worked closely with student teams that exceeded her expectations, delivering materials to advance the needs of the Internet Archive, and the wider library community. “The iPIP Clinic has become an indispensable partner to me as I do my work as an advocate for libraries working to build a healthier digital information ecosystem,” Bailey said. Amanda Levendowski, associate professor of law and the founding director of the iPIP Clinic, credited Bailey and her willingness to work with students as a reason the clinic has been successful in tackling cutting-edge issues at the intersection of technological advancements and social justice. “Library lawyering work is an exercise in imagination,” Levendowski said. “A sense of play and creativity around the law has never been more important, because that’s going to be how we get out of the moment we’re in.” Posted in News | Defending Libraries in the Digital Age: Lila Bailey Calls for Library Legal Champions at Georgetown Law’s iPIP Clinic Celebration by Caralee Adams Caralee Adams Libraries, now more than ever, need innovative, dedicated champions to help them meet the needs of the public in the digital age.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. I would never have thought I would see the day when the library system itself is under attack. At home I had a couple of shelves of treasured kids’ books while my parents had walls coated with books. The books and periodicals of my writer and publisher grandfather were on a special bookshelf in the room next to the kitchen—maybe not consulted often, but proudly protected and displayed. But the delight of first going to the White Plains Public Library is indelibly imprinted in my mind—the bookshelves seemed to go on forever. There was book after book after Alice in Wonderland in the card catalog, books about mathematical recreations I could not imagine finding anywhere else, and record albums I could borrow. And I still remember the librarian saying, “You can read any of these books you want, and if we don’t have the one you want, we can get it for you [through the magic of interlibrary loan].” And this was all for free, which was the only thing that worked for a child. And available to everyone who could get their bones through that door of that magic place. As a child, I did not know how special libraries were—I thought it was just how society worked—I thought there always were and always would be public libraries. I did not realize how fragile this system was until I became a digital librarian in order to make this promise come true for the next generation, a generation of digital learners. I did not think that in my lifetime this offer, this seeming human right, would be threatened by the people that made the fantasy-land of the White Plains Public Library possible: the corporate publishers. Based on a simple but catastrophic business decision, the big publishers are making it impossible for libraries to do their core functions of preservation and enduring access in the digital era. Netflix, for instance, recently changed its terms of service to explicitly prohibit archiving, therefore allowing them to remove or change any movie for all subscribers at once. 1 The decision of the big publishers that is so threatening to the mission of libraries is to stop selling their products. Their books, music, and videos—as the world moves digital—are only available for temporary access by library patrons from databases the publishers control. At the dawn of the Internet age, we dreamed of a different future, a future where authors got paid for their work, where writings would find their natural audience, where small publishers would flourish supporting a wider range of authors, where new publications and services would democratize production and access to information. The Internet could have been used to create this future, and many of us have worked hard to make it come true, but the lack of antitrust enforcement led to rapid consolidation of publishers, Internet technologies allowed successful online publishers to become dominant worldwide, and an advertising model that made for very few commercial winners. This toxic brew of the collapse of independent publishers and limited commercial platform controlling distribution has made the decentralized Internet seem like a lost opportunity. Libraries in the United States are under attack through book bannings, 2 defundings , 3 increasing criminalization of librarianship , 4 licensing restrictions , 5 governors vetoing protection for libraries , 6 and a judiciary that is steadily siding with publishers . 7 This is a long way from a century ago when the United States led in libraries with the Carnegie libraries—supported by legislatures and judiciary—helping create an educated citizenry ready to enter the world stage.

But there is hope for libraries and a public seeking alternatives to the flood of disinformation and promoted materials coming from online and offline information producers. Libraries are still funded and staffed with smart, caring professionals. Readers are becoming more media-aware and discerning. Best of all, people are still free to create and publish quality works with the remaining distribution and compensation structures. It is still possible to have a game with many winners, but maybe this window is closing. To preserve the library system’s ability to help create an informed citizenry, we need libraries to buy, preserve, and offer free public access to the broad public. Our libraries have traditionally supported local authors and local publishers, and preserved a broad range of text, audio, and moving image materials. Libraries, when not stopped, have moved with the times, through microfilm and CD-ROMs, and now to the Internet in order to provide preservation and access. Our collective budgets in the United States support over 5% of all trade publishing revenues 8 —enough to cause a leveraged buyout firm, KKR, to find buying major publisher Simon and Schuster a good investment. 9 Our libraries are a captive market for a shrinking number of academic and trade publishers. The best case is that large publishers see the value in selling their digital products through multiple marketplaces, including to libraries. The next best is that independent publishers sell to libraries, and libraries eagerly buy, preserve, and lend from their owned collections. Authors, musicians, filmmakers and creators of all kinds could choose publishers and websites that sell to libraries . 10 Our evolving digital age can be our next Carnegie moment or it can be a Library of Alexandria moment.

To preserve the library system’s ability to help create an informed citizenry, we need libraries to buy, preserve, and offer free public access to the broad public. Our libraries have traditionally supported local authors and local publishers, and preserved a broad range of text, audio, and moving image materials. Libraries, when not stopped, have moved with the times, through microfilm and CD-ROMs, and now to the Internet in order to provide preservation and access. Our collective budgets in the United States support over 5% of all trade publishing revenues 8 —enough to cause a leveraged buyout firm, KKR, to find buying major publisher Simon and Schuster a good investment. 9 Our libraries are a captive market for a shrinking number of academic and trade publishers. The best case is that large publishers see the value in selling their digital products through multiple marketplaces, including to libraries. The next best is that independent publishers sell to libraries, and libraries eagerly buy, preserve, and lend from their owned collections. Authors, musicians, filmmakers and creators of all kinds could choose publishers and websites that sell to libraries . 10 Our evolving digital age can be our next Carnegie moment or it can be a Library of Alexandria moment.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. As a writer and artist that draws on the long history of gender nonconformity in my work, a driving force behind my practice is the idea that a longing for history will always be a fundamental aspect of humanity, so long as memory itself serves as a foundation for human consciousness. Everyone has a history, but the majority of people are not taught how to look back in order to find it. One problem is the depth and breadth of our losses. People and their prized possessions are destroyed by accident and by design throughout history: armed conflict, invasion, willful destruction, natural disaster, decay. Then there is the fantasy of destruction, a destructive force in its own right, the perception that nothing survives. That fantasy begets a reality of its own: because I don’t go looking for what survives, I don’t find it, or I don’t recognize it when I see it. This is true across subcultures and among historically marginalized or oppressed groups, and for the queer and trans subjects whose histories I am interested in recovering in particular. In the twenty-first century, access to queer and trans history is an accident of birth: knowing someone in your family or neighborhood, living in a place where it isn’t legislated against, going to a school that dares teach it, affording admission into one of the universities that offers classes on it. My research process tends to triangulate between the archive of my own weird and imperfect human experiences and the debris I collect around them, small collections amassed by and for queer and trans people, and larger institutions that also contain relevant material that begs to be recontextualized. Or to make it personal: to write my upcoming book Bargain Witch: Essays in Self Initiation, I used my journals and the Wayback Machine to look at old websites I’d made when I was 14, the archive of the William Way LGBT center in Philadelphia where I grew up, and special collections at major institutions like the Fales Library at NYU , the Digital Transgender Archive at Northwestern University, and the British Library in London. All my adult life I’ve made pilgrimage between the intimate domestic spaces where people preserve their own histories, to local collections set up on shoestring budgets as a labor of love, to the vast, climate-controlled repositories of state and higher education that have more recently begun to preserve our histories, each enhancing what it is possible for me to know, delight in, or mourn, about where I have come from, the forebears by blood and by choice that imbue my life with its many possibilities. It’s a creative act to find and make sense of my own history, one that requires a leap of faith in order to fill in the silences, erasures, omissions, and genuine mysteries that old books and documents, records and artifacts, represent. A lot is left to the imagination. Much of what survives from the past asks more questions than we can answer. This is true for queer and trans archival traces, as it is for other aspects of humanity that are poorly accounted for in public records, or actively discriminated against through surveillance and omission in equal parts. Classically, archives are brutal, desolate places to find humanity; they were never meant to record the nuances of flesh and blood existence so much as they originate as a way governments keep track of their resources. It has taken millennia for us to conceive of records as places where humanity might be honored rather than betrayed. This is an epic change: I am in awe of the fact that I live in a time where the heft of documentary history—clay, parchment, paper, and now pixel—is shifting paradigms from records kept by anonymous paid laborers to flatten life into statistics, to records kept by people who dare to name themselves and their subjectivity, who collect something of themselves and their obsessions, for other kindred spirits to find. From archives as places meant to consolidate power, to places containing mess and sprawl, places for heated encounters. In the past few decades of “living with the internet” these places and encounters have multiplied exponentially, as queer and trans subcultures have relied on message boards, blogs, and personal websites to share information. I personally relied (and still rely on) on reddit, and the classic, Hudson’s FTM Resource Guide ( www.ftmguide.org ), and TopSurgery.Net to navigate the healthcare system in both the UK and USA in order to access hormones and surgery—part of a much longer tradition of “the Transgender Internet” that Avery Dame-Griff chronicles in his book The Two Revolutions (2023). To say nothing of AOL in the early 2000s, the culture on Tumblr in the early-to-mid 2010s and printed publications like Original Plumbing and archived copies of the FTM Newsletter. Digital environments informed me of physical places, and vice versa, and each expanded and embellished my appreciation of the other. From reading books and trawling the internet, I knew places like San Francisco, New York, London, and Berlin would be where I could find other trans people. When I moved to London, I knew to go to Gay’s the Word , a queer bookshop that first opened in 1979, to make friends, and eventually, to get a job. When I started my own queer book club, or wanted to find zine fairs or club nights, I often found information about them on tumblr or instagram. When traveling to new cities, a gay friend tipped me off that any place recommended by BUTT Magazine would show me a good time. But in my queer and trans context, both digital and paper-based archives and libraries are often labors of love, made from scratch, published with a “by us for us” ethos that is under-resourced and so always in danger of disappearing. Most queer publishing from the 1960s onward was issued in small, independent presses that have disappeared. An interesting model for documenting this is the British Library’s Endangered Archives Programme , where resources and expertise is shared to catalog and digitize collections materials in a centrally kept database. This is mutually beneficial to the places where the materials are kept—accurate cataloging is crucial to using and developing any archive—as well as to interested audiences further afield. And this feels also like a pragmatic approach to the reality of loss: we might not be able to predict what will survive over time, but keeping abundant records in multiple locations of what has existed will at least allow us to mourn our losses. Download the complete Vanishing Culture report. A culmination of my interests in hunting and gathering queer history is my imprint and traveling installation: CAMP BOOKS. I started CAMP BOOKS in 2018 as a way to highlight the places I’d most enjoyed meeting queer and trans people–independent bookshops, which have a rich, radical history throughout subculture–and as a way to keep the focus on making and distributing publications about the obscure histories I was unearthing in my research. Before libraries sought to cater to an LGBTQIA+ readership, specialist bookshops like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop , Giovanni’s Room , and Gay’s the Word were the only places you could find concentrations of queer, feminist books with positive portrayals of queer lives. These shops were hubs of culture: places where community events were held and publicized, activists groups were able to meet, and friendship and romance could blossom in broad daylight. CAMP BOOKS sets up pop-up bookshops, tables at art and zine fairs, and also builds installations in galleries and community spaces to continue this tradition. I also sell rare books and ephemera related to queer history through CAMP BOOKS in order to fund our efforts, including new publications, zines, and posters related to queer and trans history. The CAMP BOOKS motto is: “Queer Pasts Nourish Queer Futures,” and this extends to our model of generating funds from past efforts to fund new writing and work. I also believe this logic can extend to anyone: preserving what interests you about the past brings a particular pleasure of connection into the present. Most of the people I have loved in my life, I have met and known through shared obsessions with the past, and it has brought a lot of pleasure and adventure into my life. An abiding concern I have had about cultural preservation—in my case, subcultural preservation, because the people I love across time existed in a myriad of DIY subcultures that often cross-pollinated art, music, and literary influences—and have heard from others, revolves around the question of inheritance and access. You can inherit books and papers, art and artifacts, but you can’t inherit e-books, and born digital archives require specialist care and technology. My hope is that this divide is bridged by reconsidering the nature of inheritance itself: rather than an individual’s gain, queer and trans history is something that we are all heir to, and can all benefit from accessing. Large institutions, and large digital repositories in particular, play a crucial role in rewriting the meaning of inheritance by offering freely accessible, and accurately cataloged, information. But ultimately, archives that document human experience begin at home, and rely on people whose love for their lives, their friends, and their scenes inspire them to save posters, photographs, and other receipts–online and offline–that document their experiences. I hope after reading this, you start saving something of your life now.

Namely, we were there to connect with the digital rights community. We wanted to participate in an event where thousands of people travel from around the world to discuss the current and future state of the internet, and to meet others who were involved in building decentralized, distributed, and peer-to-peer network technologies. Thus we took the opportunity to organize activities before and during the conference: a local networking workshop co-organized with g0v, sessions on both DWeb organizing and how fiction can better depict surveillance technologies, a DWeb dinner, as well as a final day of tabling in the halls of the venue. DWeb x g0v Local Network Workshop Michael Suantak, Cheng of g0v, and mai standing in front of National Taipei University of Technology where the community network workshop took place We partnered with g0v, the leading decentralized civic technology community in Taiwan , to co-organize an event focused on local community networks at the National Taipei University of Technology. When we met with them several months ago, g0v leaders told us that they wanted to connect with those building and stewarding community networks. Such networks are controlled directly by communities, especially in places where internet access is non-existent or undermined, in order to maintain local network services and ensure internet connections are available or affordable. In Taiwan, these types of decentralized network infrastructures are a potential lifeline, as internet shutdowns in the country remain an ever-present threat . DWeb standing banner in front of the classroom where the workshop took place Our event, “Building Resilient Connections: A Hands-on Local Network Workshop” dove into the core concepts of community networks, their technical setups, and the ways they’re making a difference in under-served communities worldwide. We had a great turnout: attended by more than 35 people. Since we had a survey built into our registration form, we knew what topics the participants were interested in learning about and tailored the workshop to them. These included community networks’ key challenges and opportunities, technical overview and tools, and issues surrounding their ethics, privacy and security. Cheng introducing g0v at the community network workshop Notably, we had community network leaders from Myanmar, Taiwan, and Indonesia present case studies on their community networks, from the technologies they use to the ways they govern and manage the networks. We were lucky to be able to bring Michael Suantak to lead the presentations and the workshop on locally-hosted services. He was a 2024 DWeb Fellow, but for visa reasons he was not able to attend DWeb Camp in person, so we were happy to learn from him in person! Michael Suantak giving a presentation on local community networks Sean of Mesh TWC also gave a presentation and workshop, as well as Gustaff H. Iskandar of Common Room who joined us from Indonesia. The sessions were not recorded, but you can view their notes and slides below (note: these are Google docs and Google slides). Presentation by Michael Suantak Presentation by Gustaff H. Iskandar ( Common Room ) Presentation by Sean ( Mesh TWC ) Slide from a presentation by Gustaff of Common Room on community networks We ended with a few hands-on activities with Meshtastic LoRa devices and local-first services, as well as a discussion on the role of community networks in digital literacy and empowerment. Group photo of the community networks workshop who stayed until the end! Attending RightsCon 2025 RightsCon brings over 3,000 people from all corners of the globe to discuss the most pressing concerns facing people’s digital rights today. At a sprawling convention center in Taipei, hundreds of sessions took place across the last week of February, on issues related to free expression, privacy, and innovation and creativity online — specifically surrounding organizing tactics, policy advocacy, and sustaining movements in the face of rising authoritarianism worldwide. There was also notable interest in decentralized web solutions to these crises, with sessions led by DWeb Camp attendees, the Social Web Foundation , Equalitie , Project Liberty , Open Future , WITNESS , Open Archive , and Creative Commons . RightsCon25 Opening Ceremony Round Table DWeb Workshop We led a workshop discussion on strategies for decentralized, transnational organizing. Approximately 25 people attended and came to learn about the DWeb community. We shared our approach to building trust and solidarity between projects and individuals working to create a decentralized web that is usable, secure, and people-centric, all in spite of the exploitative and profit-driven status quo of the Internet. We spent the hour strategizing effective tactics for transnational organizing. Namely, how to use in-person and online gatherings to organize, share resources, and build enduring connections to strengthen our efforts. Stop Surveillance Copaganda Workshops Lia Holland of Fight for the Future and I co-facilitated three workshops on the Stop Surveillance Copaganda project, a partnership between Fight For the Future and COMPOST Magazine . The discussions centered around how we better support fiction that depicts futures and alternate realities where privacy is a universally respected human right. Attendees shared useful resources and analyses of surveillance tech’s impacts, as well as real-world tactics to resist illegal surveillance. Everything we gleaned from that week will go into a toolkit for authors and artists to more justly depict surveillance technologies. Stop Surveillance Copaganda Session at RightsCon25 RightsCon Booth We signed up to table at RightsCon in order to introduce ourselves to the digital rights community and meet those working to build alternative, decentralized technologies. Dozens of new and familiar faces stopped by to grab our stickers and zines, and to learn about what the DWeb community has been doing to build our movement. Senior Organizer, mai, tabling at RightsCon25 DWebbers Dinner Mid-conference, we organized a DWeb hot pot dinner for those of us in town for the event! Group photo of DWebbers having hot pot! Attending RightsCon this year felt incredibly productive and worthwhile. We’ll likely be there at the next one — in order to build better webs and learn from the past, it’s crucial that we connect with those directly confronting the pervasive challenges of the mainstream internet. That has always been our north star: to build decentralized technologies that help solve real world problems, not just in the future, but now.

We’ll likely be there at the next one — in order to build better webs and learn from the past, it’s crucial that we connect with those directly confronting the pervasive challenges of the mainstream internet. That has always been our north star: to build decentralized technologies that help solve real world problems, not just in the future, but now.

And if compressed with x265, it maybe could even be 5 GB with no noticeable loss of quality? I see the bitrate is about 6 Mbps. This seems much more than strictly necessary, and I think 1 Mbps would be plenty with respect to x265, especially seeing that these are cartoons and not live video. The amount of information in them is proportionally small. Using ffmpeg, a setting of -crf 23 with the codec libx265 should be more than enough for a very faithful reproduction. I hope you will make this available as an option for those without a fast internet connection or limitless storage space. ...Less favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite ...

We are avid readers, educators, researchers, librarians, authors, publishers and lifelong learners whose lives and communities have been transformed by public access to knowledge. In light of the ongoing legal battle in Hachette v. Internet Archive , we are writing to urge you to reconsider your stance and restore our access to the books that you have caused to be removed from the Internet Archive’s lending collection. For more than twenty years, the Internet Archive has empowered students, teachers, and readers around the world, providing access to a vital library of books, many of which are otherwise inaccessible to readers due to geographical, financial, or physical constraints. Your decision to remove books from the Internet Archive is having a devastating impact on readers in the US and around the world, with far-reaching implications: 1. Educational Impact: Students, scholars, and educators rely on the Internet Archive for access to research materials and literature that support their learning and academic growth, particularly in underserved communities where access is limited. Your removal of these books impedes academic progress and innovation, as well as imperiling the preservation of our cultural and historical knowledge. 2. Equity and Accessibility: The Internet Archive democratizes access to knowledge. By restricting access to these books, you have made it harder for the most vulnerable people in our society to read and learn. Not everyone has a local library, can afford to travel to one, feels safe accessing the information they need in public, or can ignore the potentially life-altering repercussions when tech platforms collect data on their reading habits. Your removal of more than 500,000 books from public access is a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others. 3. Cultural Preservation: Libraries’ digital preservation of books ensures that our cultural heritage is maintained for future generations. In order to preserve digital books, libraries must be allowed to own them, not just license them short-term. Your attack on the rights of libraries is an attack on cultural preservation. We understand the importance of protecting authors' rights and ensuring fair compensation for their work. There is a way to achieve these goals while still allowing libraries to do what they have always done—help readers read. We urge you to explore solutions with the Internet Archive that support both authors and the public good, such as selling eBooks to libraries to own, lend, and preserve. In the spirit of fostering a more equitable, informed, and connected world, we respectfully ask you to restore access to the books you’ve taken down , and work with the Internet Archive to find a sustainable solution that empowers everyone in our society to read and learn.

2009. 155 30-minute episodes were produced over 21 seasons. Before its 
official premiere, the show aired for test audiences in the Nebraska and Buffalo, New York markets (their PBS member stations, the Nebraska ETV [now Nebraska Public Media] and WNED-TV , respectively, were co-producers of the show). The purpose of the show was to encourage a love of books and 
reading among children. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational 
interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched 
bearing the name of the program. The public television series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards , 10 of which were in the "Outstanding Children's Series" category. [5] The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila 
Liggett, PhD who in partnership with Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry 
Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York created the television 
series. The original team also included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen 
Schecter, and host LeVar Burton . The show's title was conceived by an unknown intern at WNED. [6] Each episode centered on a topic from a featured children's book 
that was explored through a number of on-location segments or stories. 
The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went 
to the library. After the show's cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was removed from the schedule. [3] At the time, it was the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . [note 1] It was one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo. On June 
20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 
36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes 
App Store. [7] Developed by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows 
children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring 
Burton, and earn rewards for reading. On the week of July 11, 2013, Reading Rainbow celebrated its 30th anniversary. [8] In May 2014, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds to make the app available online and for Android ,
 game consoles, smartphones, and other streaming devices along with 
creating a classroom version with the subscription fee waived for up to 
13,000 disadvantaged classrooms. The effort met its initial fundraising 
goal of $1,000,000 in 11 hours, [9] and ended a few days later at $5,408,916 from 105,857 backers. [10] This campaign led to the launch of Skybrary by Reading Rainbow , a web-based expansion of the Reading Rainbow app experience. [11] Due to a legal dispute, licensing of the Reading Rainbow brand was revoked from RRKidz in October 2017, and all its platforms (including Skybrary) [ citation needed ] were rebranded to LeVar Burton Kids . [12] citation needed An interactive revival titled Reading Rainbow Live debuted on Looped in March 2022. 2023-11-01 22:32:14 ReadingRainbowTVSeries plus-circle Add Review comment Reviews

I want something that is organized like yours is and from here. All I ever seem to find is broken up episodes from different people scattered on here and I don’t want to use free anime streaming sites because they have ads, malware, pop ups and they seem to skip the intros and outros and etc. I’d basically like what you did here but for the remastered Funimation version with Bruce Faulconer’s score.

They look sort of similar to how the Rock the Dragon Edition DVDs from 2013 looked. One of the differences between the Madman DVDs and the Pioneer DVDs/Rock the Dragon Edition is that the "Stand by for Dragon Ball Z" bumper plays at the start of the DVDs, before the Rock the Dragon theme song. Both the Pioneer DVDs and the Madman singles are formatted like an hour long movie, whereas Rock the Dragon Edition has OPs and EDs for every single episode. ...Less  ... More... about piracy?

Personally, I do wanna know if you still have the Discs/ISO files saved, and if so, would you be willing to upload them to archive.org? It'd be good to have the actual DVDs themselves backed up so if someone wants to see how the DVDs themselves were as a whole, they'd have the chance. I do plan to upload the single discs I have, but I don't have nearly enough of em to cover the whole series. ...Less favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite ...

I have the orange bricks and it's just not the same. This has it beat hands down.

More... I could make a suggestion, iKaos had recently uploaded a Dragon Ball Z Level Sets collection. I think you should use that for the remaining episodes for Season 1. The episodes may not have the FUNimation in-house dub, but if I'm being honest, you have to work with what you got, and I'll take anything I can get. ...Less favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite ... More... though the UUE does not have those three episodes, will you still load those three episodes so that one could download the complete series from one source and at a reasonable size? thank you for your hard work, and i hope you're still active on IA and get back to me on this :) 4/7/22 update I see the episodes you mentioned, but I'm also a little confused, because in the UUE, it's missing episodes 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, & 37... I know when it concerns the Rock The Dragon collection, those episodes were heavily edited, so im not surprised if those are missing, but if you can, if you could clarify for me why those are missing, or they never were there to begin with, I'd greatly appreciate it. ...Less 617,451 Views 617,451 1,184 Favorites 1,184 Favorites 52 Reviews 52 DOWNLOAD OPTIONS download 412 files  download  Uplevel

examples of the noir style include dark, stylized detective films such as John Huston ’s The
Maltese Falcon (1941), Frank Tuttle’s This Gun for Hire (1942), Otto Preminger ’s Laura (1944),
and Edward
Dmytryk ’s Murder,
My Sweet (1944). Banned in occupied countries during the war,
these films became available throughout Europe beginning in 1946. French
cineastes admired them for their cold, cynical characters and dark, brooding
style, and they afforded the films effusive praise in French journals such
as Cahiers
du cinéma . French critics coined the term film noir in
reference to the low-keyed lighting used to enhance these
dramas stylistically—although the term would not become commonplace in
international critical circles until the publication of the book Panorama
du film noir americain (1955) by Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton. Early

films reflected the disenchantment of the times. Pessimism and disillusionment
became increasingly present in the American psyche during the Great Depression of
the 1930s and the world war that followed. After the war, factors such as an
unstable peacetime economy, McCarthyism , and the
looming threat of atomic warfare manifested themselves
in a collective sense
of uncertainty. The corrupt and claustrophobic world of film noir embodied
these fears. Several examples of film noir, such as Dmytryk’s Cornered (1945), George Marshall ’s The Blue Dahlia (1946), Robert
Montgomery ’s Ride the Pink Horse (1947), and John Cromwell ’s Dead
Reckoning (1947), share the common story line of a war veteran who
returns home to find that the way of life for which he has been fighting no
longer exists. In its place is the America of film noir: modernized, heartless,
coldly efficient, and blasé about matters such as political corruption
and organized
crime . The darkness of these

of the major directors of film noir—such as Huston, Dmytryk, Cromwell, Orson Welles , and
others—were American. However, other Hollywood directors
renowned for a film noir style hailed from Europe , including Billy Wilder , Alfred Hitchcock , Jacques Tourneur ,
and Fritz Lang .
It is said that the themes of noir attracted European directors, who often felt
like outsiders within the Hollywood studio system. Such directors had been
trained to emphasize cinematic style as much as acting and narrative in order
to convey thought and emotion. Many

the genre Defining
the genre  Controversy
exists as to whether film noir can be classified as a genre or
subgenre, or if the term merely refers to stylistic elements common to various genres . Film noir
does not have a thematic coherence: the term is most often applied to crime
dramas, but certain westerns and comedies have been cited as examples of film
noir by some critics. Even such sentimental comedy-dramas as Frank Capra ’s It’s a Wonderful
Life (1946) have been cited as “noir-ish” by critics who find in
its suicidal hero and
bleak depiction of small-town life a tone suitably dismal for film noir. Such
films are also sometimes designated as “semi-noir,” or film gris (“gray
film”), to indicate their hybrid status. Controversy

critics argue that film noir is but an arbitrary designation for
a multitude of dissimilar black-and-white dramas of the late 1940s and early
’50s. Film scholar Chris Fujiwara contends that the makers of such films
“didn’t think of them as ‘films noir’; they thought they were making crime
films, thrillers, mysteries, and romantic melodramas.
The nonexistence of ‘noir’ as a production category during the supposed heyday
of noir obviously problematizes the history of the genre.” Yet it cannot be
questioned that film noir connotes specific visual images and an aura of
postwar cynicism in
the minds of most film buffs. Indeed, several common characteristics connect
most films defined as “noir.” Other

most films defined as “noir.” The isolation from society of the typical noir hero was
underscored by the use of stark high-contrast lighting—the most notable visual
feature of film noir. The shadowy noir style can be traced to the German Expressionist cinema
of the silent era. Robert Wiene ’s Das
Kabinett des Doktor Caligari (1920; The Cabinet
of Dr. Caligari ) contains one of the best early examples of the
lighting techniques used to inspire the genre. Wiene used visual elements to
help define the title character’s madness, including tilted cameras to
present skewed images
and a dark atmosphere in which only the faces of the actors were visible. This
Expressionistic style was later used by German directors such as Fritz Lang ( Metropolis ,
1927; M , 1931) and F.W. Murnau ( Nosferatu ,
1922; Sunrise ,
1927). The isolation from society of the typical noir hero was

1941), John F. Seitz ( Double
Indemnity , 1944), Karl Freund ( Key Largo ,
1948), and Sid Hickox ( The Big Sleep ,
1948) to heighten the sombre tone of films in the genre. Classic images of noir
included rain-soaked streets in the early morning hours; street lamps with
shimmering halos; flashing neon signs on seedy taverns, diners, and apartment
buildings; and endless streams of cigarette smoke wafting in and out of
shadows. Such images would lose their indelibility with realistic lighting or
colour cinematography . These lighting effects were used in Hollywood by

Indemnity Key Largo The Big Sleep The inherent subjectivity
of Expressionism is also evident in film noir’s use of narration and flashback.
An omniscient, metaphor-spouting narrator (often the
central character, a world-weary private eye) frequently clarifies a
characteristically labyrinthine noir plot or offers a subjective, jaded point of
view. In other films—such as Welles ’s Citizen Kane and Wilder ’s Double Indemnity and Sunset
Boulevard (1950)—the denouement (often
the death or downfall of the central character) is revealed in the opening
scenes; flashbacks then tell of the circumstances that led to the tragic
conclusion. Tension and suspense are increased by the use of all-knowing
narrators and flashbacks, in that the audience is always cognizant of
impending doom. The inherent subjectivity

Boulevard The noir hero The noir hero The heroes of noir generally share certain qualities,
such as moral ambiguity , a
fatalistic outlook, and alienation from society. They also exhibit an existential acceptance
of random, arbitrary occurrences as being the determining factors in life.
Although the “hard-boiled detective” is the stereotypical noir hero ,
the central male characters in film noir range
from drifters ( John
Garfield in Tay Garnett ’s The
Postman Always Rings Twice , 1946) to college professors ( Edward G.
Robinson in Lang’s The Woman in
the Window , 1944). The ethics that
these characters espouse are often borne more of personal code than true concern
for their fellow man. For example, Humphrey Bogart (the
actor perhaps most associated with the genre) as private eye Sam Spade in The
Maltese Falcon is emotionally indifferent to the murder of his
partner and avenges his death primarily because “when one of your organization
gets killed, it’s bad business to let the killer get away with it.” Such
compassionless pragmatism is
found in the most noble, as well as the most tarnished, of noir heroes. The
weakest of such characters exhibit an abundance of tragic flaws, often
including an uncontrollable lust for duplicitous women. The heroes of noir generally share certain qualities,

Maltese Falcon    Noir women Noir women Noir women are often characterized as femme fatales
or “spider women”; in the words of one critic, they are “comfortable in the
world of cheap dives, shadowy doorways, and mysterious settings.” Well aware of
their sexual attractiveness, they cunningly and ruthlessly manipulate their
male counterparts to gain power or wealth; for example, by conspiring to murder
an aged, wheelchair-bound (i.e., impotent) spouse. A quintessential example of
the noir temptress is Kathie Moffat, as portrayed by Jane Greer in
Tourneur’s Out of the Past (1947).
While flirting with Robert Mitchum ’s
character in a Mexican café, she describes a local night spot that she thinks
would be to his liking. As she leaves the café, she turns to Mitchum and coyly
says “I sometimes go there”—at which point, the viewer familiar with the
noir genre knows
that Mitchum is on a one-way path to destruction. Nevertheless, the women of
film noir often evoke sympathy, as they are frequently victims of emotional or
physical abuse, with such victimization providing impetus for
their vengeance .

We partnered with the Sunlight Foundation , Philadelphia’s Committee of Seventy (a non-partisan government watchdog) and University of Delaware’s Center for Community Research & Service for a pilot project to assist those studying how local media in the region are meeting the information needs of their communities and assessing the influence of political spending on the region's media ecosystem. Trained volunteers and others searched through archived television news content to initially identify more than 8,000 campaign commercials and tagged them with information on who paid for them.  Each identified political ad in the online library, that occurred within news programming, includes sponsorship identification that links through to the Sunlight Foundation's "Political Ad Sleuth" crowd-sourced presentations of who paid how much to the TV stations for airing the ads. Post-hoc analysis, using digital content “fingerprinting” algorithms identified hundreds of political ads our human evaluators missed, raising the total to 8,594 within news programs.  Plus, the algorithms were able to analyze all the entertainment programs during the 65-day monitoring period, finding 5,081 political ads in them.  Metadata regarding the newly found ads, and an exploratory visualization tool, will be available soon. University of Delaware researchers analyzed the content of TV news broadcasts to assess their topics and relationships with issues raised in accompanying political ads.  They studied a representative sampling of newscasts on the major Philadelphia commercial television stations and found the time devoted to political ads outnumbered the time devoted to substantive political stories 45 to 1. Project Resources Research study: Political Ads & Local TV News - Philly 2014 , by Danilo Yanich View all identified political campaign ads in TV news Search Philadelphia content from the TV News Archive Ad Filings in Philadelphia Datasets of our findings available in .csv format Examples of each identified political ad Archived web sites (key word searchable)    Why? These unique collections offer unprecedented opportunities to explore the influence of powerful actors in the political process, investigate representation of important community issues within a media ecosystem and learn more about financial sources of political influence during the run-up to 2014’s November 4 elections. Although ambitious in its scope this year, the Project is also a pilot experiment to inform how its technologies and organizational collaborations can be improved and cost-effectively scaled across the U.S. in coming years.

The 9/11 Television News Archive is a library of news coverage of the events of 9/11/2001 and their aftermath as presented by U.S. and international broadcasters. A resource for scholars, journalists,  and the public, it presents one week of news broadcasts for study, research and analysis.

Explore 3,000 hours of international TV News from 20 channels over 7 days, and select analysis by scholars. REFLECTING ON 9/11: Twenty Years of Archived TV News Webinar On Sep 9, 2021 the Internet Archive will host an online webinar,
              " Reflecting on 9/11: Twenty Years of Archived TV News. "
              Scholars, journalists, archivists, and data scientists will discuss the importance
              of archived television to understand unfolding history.
              Participants include the Internet Archive,

After brief welcoming remarks by Howard Besser , Director of New York University's Moving Image Archiving & Preservation Program and Richard Allen, Department of Cinema Studies, Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, 10 speakers presented the following short talks and ensuing discussion , which you can watch on the Internet Archive . Introducing the 9/11 TV News Archive Brewster Kahle, Internet Archive Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian at Internet Archive, introduces the 9/11 TV News Archive and reviews the case for online scholarly and research access to television news. Brewster Kahle, Internet Archive Mediated Meanings and Symbolic Politics: Exploring the Continued Significance of 9/11 News Coverage Brian A. Monahan, Iowa State University In-depth analysis of television news coverage of the September 11 attacks and their aftermath reveals how these events were fashionedinto 9/11, the politically and morally charged signifier that has profoundly shaped public perception, policy and practice in the last decade. Understanding how and why the coverage took shape as it did yields new insights into the social, cultural and political consequences of the attacks, while also highlighting the role of news media in the creation, affirmation and dissemination of meanings in modern life. Brian A. Monahan, Iowa State University Fighting Ephemerality: Seeing TV News through the Lens of the Archive Deborah Jaramillo, Boston University The experience of watching the news on TV as events unfold is often complicated by the space of exhibition -- typically, the domestic space. When hour upon hour of news is catalogued and archived -- placed in a space of focused study -- the news and the experience become altogether different. What was meant to be ephemeral acquires permanence, and what is usually a short-term viewing experience becomes a rigorous, frame-by-frame examination. In this presentation I will discuss how the archive challenges researchers to adopt new ways of seeing and explaining TV news. Deborah Jaramillo, Boston University An Overview of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive Marshall Breeding, Vanderbilt Television News Archive The Vanderbilt Television Archive was started in 1968. Marshall Breeding gives a brief overview of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive and how it carries out its mission to preserve and provide access to US national television news. Marshall Breeding, Vanderbilt Television News Archive Media Ecology and Online News Archives Mark J. Williams, Department of Film and Media Studies, Dartmouth College Online TV news archives are a crucial digital resource to facilitate the awareness of and critical study of Media Ecology. Two significant research and teaching outcomes for this area of study are A) to better understand the role of television news regarding the mediation of society and its popular memory, and B) to underscore the significance of television news to the goal of an informed citizenry. The 9/11 TV News Archive will enhance and ensure the continued study of the indelible tragic events and aftermath of 9/11, and make possible new interventions within journalism history and media history, via  online capacities for access and collaboration. Mark J. Williams, Department of Film and Media Studies, Dartmouth College Documentation and Access: A Latino/a Studies Perspective on Using Video Archives Carolyn Brown, American University This talk explores the possibilities and potential of using accessible
                    video news archives in two areas: immigration research in the field of
                    communication and documentary journalism. Prof. Brown speaks of the
                    significance of video news archives in her current film, The Salinas
                    Project, and discusses her continuing research on Latino/as and
                    immigration in the news. Carolyn Brown, American University Image Analysis for Media Study Michael Lesk, Rutgers University Focusing on television news coverage of the 9/11 attacks, this brief
                    talk outlines strategies for automatic quantitative analysis of
                    television news imagery. Michael Lesk, Rutgers University Live Dispatch: The Ethics of Audio Vision Media Coverage in Trauma
                    and the Legacy of Sound from Shell Shock to 9/11 Beatrice Choi, New York University What experiential narratives-sensory, aesthetic and political-are
                    invisible to those exposed to traumatic events? Considering September
                    11, 2001, the media coverage of the event is predominantly visual.
                    People drift in and out of news footage, covered in dust and ash as
                    they exclaim that witnessing the attacks was like watching a movie. In
                    contrast, the wailing of sirens, the staccato thud of feet running
                    from the stricken towers, and the chaotic overlap of voices break
                    through-sometimes even swallow-the visual narratives spun for 9/11.
                    For contemporary American traumatic events, this inquires into how
                    porous the sensory modalities are in experiencing and remembering
                    shock. How, after all, do sensory representations of traumatic events
                    leave in/visible marks on documentation? Ms. Choi addresses these
                    questions by exploring sound as an alternate modality, evoking a
                    different level of traumatic indexicality. Beatrice Choi, New York University 9/11 Flipbook and Quantitative Media Study Scott Blake, artist Scott Blake has created a flipbook consisting of images of United
                    Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the south tower of the World Trade
                    Center. Accompanying the images are essays written by a wide range of
                    participants, each expressing their personal experience of the
                    September 11th attacks. In addition, the authors of the essays were
                    asked to reflect on, and respond to, the flipbook itself. Not
                    surprisingly, the majority of the essayists experienced the events
                    through news network footage. Blake is distributing his 9/11 Flipbooks
                    to encourage a constructive dialog regarding the media's participation
                    in sensationalizing the tragedy. To further illustrate his point,
                    Blake conducted a media study using the 9/11 TV News Archive to count
                    the number of times major news networks showed the plane crashes,
                    building collapses and people falling from the towers on September 11,
                    2001. Scott Blake, artist Presentation of Fox5-NY 9/11 News Coverage & Remarks Dennis Swanson, President of Station Operations, Fox Television Mr. Swanson was President of WNBC-TV at the time of the September 11
                    attacks. He recalls his personal experiences and testifies to the
                    historical significance of an online television news archive,
                    especially for younger people whose memories of the attacks may be
                    hazy or nonexistent. Dennis Swanson, President of Station Operations, Fox Television  Watch a video summary of key events .   10-years ago: LEARNING FROM RECORDED MEMORY:

Domestic Television . It follows Billy, an extremely dimwitted, happy-go-lucky boy, and Mandy, a cynical, remorseless girl, who, after winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster , gain Grim, the mighty Grim Reaper , as their "best friend forever". Grim, who is reluctant to serve the two children, has access to supernatural items, spells, and other abilities that often lead Billy and Mandy to 
interact with otherworldly environments, characters, or situations. Billy & Mandy began as a series of segments on Grim & Evil , from which it was a spin-off, along with sister series Evil Con Carne , on August 24, 2001. Although the 2003 episodes were produced for Grim & Evil ,
 the show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003, to November 9, 
2007, on Cartoon Network. Two made-for-TV movies were also produced, Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure , which aired on March 30, 2007, and Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen , which aired on July 6, 2007. A crossover special with fellow Cartoon Network series, Codename: Kids Next Door , entitled "The Grim Adventures of the KND", aired on November 11, 2007. One more made-for-TV movie, Underfist: Halloween Bash , intended to serve as a pilot for a new spin-off series, aired on October 12, 2008. During its run, the series won two Emmy Awards and one Annie Award , with nominations for one Daytime Emmy Award , three Golden Reel Awards , and two other Annie Awards. Billy & Mandy has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise.

 After Billy and Mandy cheated at a limbo match against Grim (in 
retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he 
is enslaved in a permanently unwanted friendship with the children. [1] Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even 
fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time 
passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for 
Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a love–hate relationship with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude. Billy and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to 
venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the Underworld ,
 or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous 
beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural 
abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals 
or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional 
monsters including Dracula , the Wolfman , and the bogeyman are also comically depicted in the series. Supporting characters include Irwin ( Vanessa Marshall ), Billy's nerdy best friend who has a crush on Mandy; Harold ( Richard Steven Horvitz ), Billy's father who shares his son's stupidity; Gladys ( Jennifer Hale ), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy ( Rachael MacFarlane ), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg ( Greg Eagles ), the local bully who has a sensitive side; Hoss Delgado ( Diedrich Bader ), an overly-intense "spectral exterminator" who hunts supernatural creatures; Nergal ( David Warner / Martin Jarvis ), a friendship-seeking demon who later marries Billy's aunt and bears a son, Nergal Jr. ( Debi Derryberry ); General Skarr ( Armin Shimerman ), Billy's ill-tempered next door neighbor who originated in the Evil Con Carne animated series; and Jeff (Maxwell Atoms), a giant spider constantly trying to win the approval of the arachnophobic Billy, whom he sees as his father. The show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end
 with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters 
sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, 
but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the 
show together.

Titled Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You , it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing trepanning with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to 
pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. 
The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the
 first annual TromAnimation Film Festival. [2] After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film to his YouTube channel, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage. While working on the first season of Cow and Chicken ,
 Atoms was approached by Hanna-Barbera executives for ideas for new 
short films. Among the ideas he presented to Hanna-Barbera was 
"Milkman", centering on an anthropomorphic, superhero milk carton who 
saves the missing children depicted on his back. Though the idea was 
rejected, executives were interested in Billy and Mandy, two characters 
that were to be featured in the project. [3] Atoms was prompted to devise a series centering on the two children. 
Feeling that the characters Billy and Mandy would not be enough to carry
 a show, he began devising a third character to round out the main cast.
 He was always fascinated by the idea of a little girl befriending the Devil or the grim reaper , but eventually settled on the latter, as Cartoon Network did not approve of depictions of the devil after Cow and Chicken . Atoms pitched the Billy & Mandy concept to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon , to which Cartoon Network approved the production of a short film 6 months later (which would become the short/pilot Meet the Reaper ). [3] The show was put into full production after the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called Cartoon Network's Big Pick which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000. [4] [5] The three final choices were The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy , Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? , and Longhair and Doubledome . [4] Out of the three, Billy & Mandy attained the most votes with 57%; Robot Jones came in second place at 23% while Longhair and Doubledome received 20% of the vote. [4] Originally part of Grim & Evil , Billy & Mandy served as the main show. In each episode, an Evil Con Carne short was put between two Grim shorts. [5] An original Evil Con Carne short was produced in 2000 after Meet the Reaper , but Cartoon Network wanted to combine the series, to have a "B cartoon" as a middle segment (similar to the Dial M For Monkey and The Justice Friends shorts in Dexter's Laboratory , or the I Am Weasel segment on Cow and Chicken ). [3] On occasion, it was the other way around, with two Evil shorts and one Grim short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend . Another batch of 13 half-hour episodes were produced for Grim & Evil ,
 but on June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave 
each their own half-hour program. The split came as a result of Cartoon 
Network wanting to move away from the old 7 minute segment format, and 
focus on two 11 minute segments per half hour instead. [3] After both series aired their respective new seasons, the network gave 
Atoms a decision to continue one series, while the other would be 
dropped from production. Atoms opted to continue Billy & Mandy and accepted the network's decision, as he considered running both shows stressful. [3] Evil Con Carne characters occasionally appear on The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy .
 General Skarr was introduced into the show as a recurring character 
beginning in Season 2's "Skarred for Life", where he became Billy's new 
next-door neighbor. [6] In "Company Halt", the ninth episode of the final season which also functions as the true series finale for Evil Con Carne ,
 Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization 
and convince Skarr to rejoin them, but their plans are ultimately foiled
 by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal 
person. [7] On March 20, 2022, Craig McCracken revealed that years ago on Cartoon Network there were plans for a spinoff series titled Cheeseburger featuring Fred Fredburger and Cheese from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends , but the idea never gained traction. [8] Atoms confirmed in 2021 that the three main characters of the show are on the autism spectrum , having been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome late in life. He likened Mandy to "the cold, rational way [he] learned 
to view the world in order to survive", Billy to "the fun and joyous 
inner-world where [Atoms likes] to spend [his] time" and Grim to "the 
moral mediator between the two." [9] Reception Reception Common Sense Media gave the show a 3/5 star rating and stated that it has "goofy 
punchlines and obscure cultural references" and recommends the viewer 
age be at least 8 years old.

Internet Archive Blogs A blog from the team at archive.org Blog Announcements archive.org About Events Developers Donate Defining Web pages, Web sites and Web captures Posted on October 23, 2016 by Vinay Goel The Internet Archive has been archiving the web for 20 years and has preserved billions of webpages from millions of websites. These webpages are often made up of, and link to, many images, videos, style sheets, scripts and other web objects. Over the years, the Archive has saved over 510 billion such time-stamped web objects , which we term web captures. We define a webpage as a valid web capture that is an HTML document, a plain text document, or a PDF. A domain on the web is an owned section of the internet namespace, such as google.com or archive.org or bbc.co.uk. A host on the web is identified by a fully qualified domain name or FQDN that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System. The FQDN consists of the following parts: hostname and domain name.  As an example, in case of the host blog.archive.org , its hostname is blog and the host is located within the domain archive.org . We define a website to be a host that has served webpages and has at least one incoming link from a webpage belonging to a different domain. As of today, the Internet Archive officially holds 273 billion webpages from over 361 million websites, taking up 15 petabytes of storage.

His show was among the most-watched programmes in the UK, and his audience was more than 21 million in 1971. The Benny Hill Show was also exported to many countries around the world. He received a BAFTA Award for Best Writer and a Rose d'Or, and was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance and for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Variety. Outside television, Hill starred in films including the Ealing comedy Who Done It? (1956), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and The Italian Job (1969). His comedy song, "Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)", was 1971's number one Christmas song on the UK Singles Chart, and earned Hill an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 1972. Hill's Legacy: In 1998, Hill was featured in the Heroes of Comedy programme, and in 2002, he was ranked the third greatest British comedian of the 20th century, after Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. In 2006, Hill was voted number 17 in a poll of TV's 50 Greatest Stars by the British public. On 28 December 2006, the documentary, Is Benny Hill Still Funny?, was broadcast. The programme featured an audience that comprised a cross-section of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of Little Britain, The Catherine Tate Show and Borat. The participants favourably rated a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hill's humour from his TV shows. In November 2021, The Benny Hill Show would feature in a Christmas schedule on Freeview, alongside other programmes, such as Beadle's About and Kenny Everett's New Year Specials. Benny Hill is still widely celebrated to this day.

There were 195 episodes, with three story arcs of 65 episodes, each originally running for thirteen weeks.  I have 194 episodes; I believe one episode from the third arc no longer exists, so the one listed as episode 194 is actually 195, the series finale.

I felt bad that he's completely gone from the web after Odysee also got him, but i hope someone may post the same kind of content for the successor... maybe in high quality but who knows? Anyways, i'd like to thank you for saving all episodes of NHP as i thought that it would be lost forever. (although BBC archive has kept it hidden in archives and refused to release it officially on DVD because of music issues) but i hope this would stay for good until BBC ends up ruining it again... cheers! ...Less 4,481 Views 4,481 27 Favorites 27 Favorites 4 Reviews 4 DOWNLOAD OPTIONS download 198 files  download  Uplevel  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download download 1 file  download  download download 198 files  download  Uplevel  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download  download IN COLLECTIONS Uploaded by Ryanham1lton on January 21, 2024 SIMILAR ITEMS (based on metadata)

Contribute Contribute Contribute Contribute Privacy Policy Contribute (“Contribute”) is an online credit and debit card contributions
platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (“the Website”) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically
collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the
following: The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address

with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New York’s Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFB’s work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFB’s work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

We are not liable for delays caused by a mail or email service or any contribution or clearinghouse system. Privacy of Information These Terms include our privacy policy , which describes how we use your personal information. By using this Website, you acknowledge that we will receive certain personal information, and that you are voluntarily providing this information to us. We will not rent, sell or otherwise make available to any third party any information that identifies you or contributions you make, other than to the Campaign to which you are contributing, or to process your contribution, or to comply with applicable law, rules or regulations, including the requirement that we post contributor names, employers, occupations, and the amount of their contributions on the CFB website. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Your information will be shared with both the Campaign to which you are contributing and with us, just as it would be if you made a credit or debit card contribution directly to the Campaign at a Campaign event using a credit card reader or similar device or by using the Campaign’s website. Access to Other Information The Website maintains records containing personal information about contributors, or information that can be identified or associated with a particular contributor, for the purposes of providing public disclosure, as part of the CFB’s routine business as an agency of the City of New York, in furtherance of its missions and duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York. Examples of this information include the name of the Campaign receiving the contribution, a contributor’s address, employer, or occupation, and the amount of the contributor’s contribution. To the extent these records contain information that is not considered confidential, such information may be disclosed to the public, posted on the CFB website, or made available to the campaign through Website as part of the contribution information. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Credit card transaction information may be stored by the Campaign’s payment processor. Security To process your contribution securely, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a security protocol that provides data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity for connections to the Internet, to ensure that Account numbers and personal data you provide by using the Website are not transmitted over the Internet unencrypted and cannot be viewed by unauthorized individuals. Using the Website Contribute is an Internet-based service that allows you to make contributions to a Campaign via the Internet using your credit or debit card. By using the Website you instruct Stripe, the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to debit or charge your Account, which allows your contribution to be forwarded to the Campaign, based on the Campaign’s agreement with its payment processor and the contribution instructions you provide on the Website, subject to this Agreement. In order to use the Website, you must provide all requested information. Because federal law prohibits contributions by foreign nationals, you must be a United States citizen or a green card holder. The contribution must be made in U.S. dollars and is not tax-deductible.  The contribution must be made from your own funds and not from funds provided to you by another person or entity. The Account must be your own and must be a personal account, not a business account. You authorize the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to electronically order the Financial Institution to debit (i.e., make a charge against) your Account in the amount you specify and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, to your Account as may be necessary to make the contribution and to correct any error. Your Account will show a separate transaction for the contribution to the Campaign. Once you complete a transaction on the Website, your authorization to debit or charge your Account for this specific contribution shall remain in full force. Your contribution is considered approved when you receive an online confirmation. In Case of Errors or Questions about Your Contribution If you dispute anything related to how your contribution was processed, you must contact the Campaign. You agree to contact the Campaign as soon as possible if you believe that an error has occurred, or if there has been unauthorized use of your Account. Using this system does not guarantee or improve the chances of a Campaign receiving public funds through the Campaign Finance Program. We are not responsible for any Website, vendor, third-party, contributor, or campaign errors that might make a particular contribution ineligible for public matching funds pursuant to the New York City Campaign Finance Program. Limits on Use You must be the person authorized to make a contribution using the credit or debit card information provided to the Campaign on the Website. You agree not to use the Website in an amount that will exceed the funds or available credit line in your Account. If you do, the Campaign has no obligation to complete the transaction and you agree that the Campaign may debit your Account for its payment processor’s returned item fee or other similar fee. Your use of your Account may be limited by your agreement with your Financial Institution and by applicable law. Neither the Campaign nor the CFB is responsible for not completing a transaction as a result of any such limit on your Account and are not responsible if your Financial Institution fails to honor any charge or debit against your Account. At the Campaign’s payment processor’s sole discretion, it may refuse to complete any transaction, which it has reason to believe is not made by you, may violate any law, rule or regulation, or if it has reasonable cause not to honor it. Communications/Verifications Communications to us via the Website or the Contribute email address shall in no way be deemed to constitute legal or official notice to the CFB, or the City of New York, its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents with respect to any existing, pending or future claim or cause of action against the CFB or the City of New York or any of its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents where notice is required by federal, state, or local law.

Users are prohibited from using false email addresses. Governing Law This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the City and State of New York (notwithstanding New York choice of law or conflict of law principles), and the laws of the United States, where applicable. Jurisdiction You agree that any and all claims asserted by or against the CFB or the City of New York arising under or related to this Agreement or your use of the Website shall solely be heard and determined either in the courts of the United States located in the City or in the courts of the State located in the City and County of New York. You further agree that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement, or your use of the Website, shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York. Amendments We may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time. In such event, we will post the amended Terms and Conditions on the Website. Liability Should you choose to terminate or discontinue your use of the Website, you shall nonetheless remain liable for all amounts you contributed using the Website. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that the Campaign’s payment processor may incur in order to collect any amounts you owe under these Terms and Conditions. Feedback We welcome your comments regarding the Website. Feedback can be directed to us by email to contribute@nyccfb.info .

At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases.

To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions.

Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account.

In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections?  Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day.

For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions.

This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials.

Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. Still have questions? Contact us on social media!
