From Brooklyn Heights to Coney Island. From Bay Ridge to Bushwick. We need to address the overall health of our communities. Not just the physical. But our mental, social, and economic health too. So many of the issues we face are interconnected. We can improve public safety by investing in education and job training. We can improve the affordability of housing by creating more local jobs that pay living wages. We can address food insecurity and mental health services by investing in our physical health and that will lead to a more productive human economy.  The bottom line is that our communities have an inequitable distribution of resources, funding, and compassion. We need to ensure that Brownsville feels the same level of investment and attention as Park Slope. That East New York feels as supported as Williamsburg. That Flatbush feels like their issues are being heard just as much as Cobble Hill. Inequality continues to grow at a rapid pace. We need a BP that can look holistically at the issues affecting every corner of the borough and allocate and advocate for resources that will rebuild our communities.

Targeted Search Featured Story Ideas OpEd: Con Edison's Rate Hike A Direct Attack on Brooklynites OpEds 1 month ago New York City has long been an expensive place to live, but in recent years, affordability has gone from a challenge to a crisis. Rents are still too damn high and continue to soar, grocery prices feel like mortgage payments, and wages have not kept pace. Now, to make matters worse, Con Edison and National Grid are proposing rate hikes that will further squeeze working families, low-income households, and an already shrinking middle class. Housing Affordability & Homeownership OpEds OpEd: Brooklyn Can Turn Congestion Pricing Into a Win Jobs, Wages, & Labor 1 month ago Brooklyn has always been a borough of resilience, innovation, and community. As the MTA prepares to roll out its Congestion Pricing Program in January 2025, Brooklynites are facing yet another challenge that we can transform into an opportunity. While many see this program as a way to keep people out of Manhattan, I see it as a way to draw people into Brooklyn—and keep Brooklyn residents enjoying everything our borough has to offer. Jobs, Wages, & Labor OpEds Storylines Honoring Strength at The Gift of Life Women’s Event Community Boards 2 months ago I had the privilege of attending The Gift of Life women’s group event—a remarkable evening dedicated to celebrating resilience, honoring health, and empowering generations. The event provided an inspiring space to learn, connect, and uplift the incredible women in our community who are leading essential conversations around health and well-being.
