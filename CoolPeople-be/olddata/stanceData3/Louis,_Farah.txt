It’s Time For A Brooklyn That Works For ALL of Us. June 22, 2021, I am asking you for your continued support  in my fight for affordable housing, funding for education and economic development for our neighborhoods of NYC. As a lifelong Brooklynite, I've spent my entire life fighting to improve the lives, resources and well-being of women, girls and the people of District 45. Now, I'm working to fight for mental health services and continued efforts to combat domestic violence and sexual harassment, expand and protect affordable housing, funding for schools and ensure small businesses thrive in my community. On June 22, 2021, I am asking you for your continued support. Thank you for fighting beside me!  I'm With Farah   Proudly Endorsed by More funding for THe education of Our Future leaders.  Meet Farah… Family & Education… Public service, workers’ rights and community empowerment are passions that Farah inherited from her family. Both of her parents were Caribbean immigrants from Haiti who worked on behalf of their community: Farah’s mother as a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member; her father as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. And both left Farah with a sense of service for her community and the absolutely critical role that unions play in helping people who work for little pay to achieve a stable, middle class life in our City. Farah holds a Masters in Public Administration, from New York University Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and a Bachelors in English from Long Island University. Farah is also a proud product of the New York City public school system, attending Midwood High School in the heart of Flatbush. Experience… Council Member Farah N. Louis represents the 45th Council District, which includes the diverse neighborhoods of Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Kensington, Flatlands, Marine Park, and Canarsie. After assuming office in 2019, Council Member Louis has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City as a champion for affordable housing, small business sustainability, and equitable healthcare to improve the quality of life. She continues to tackle challenging social issues as Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus while taking a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap. Within the first 100 days in office, her first piece of legislation, Resolution 978, which calls upon Congress to pass, and the President to sign, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 was adopted by the New York City Council. During her nearly two-year tenure, she has prioritized critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence, close the food insecurity gap, expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare. As the newly-appointed Chair of the Council Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities and Addictions , Council Member Louis will fight tirelessly to expand access to equitable services for all New Yorkers seeking supportive services.  Leadership… Along with her service in the Council, Farah has successfully launched a number of aggressive grassroots initiatives with various city agencies, nonprofit organizations and businesses. She has facilitated workshops across the city and state including Brooklyn and hosted community events with and for various elected officials, including former NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson, then-Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, State Senator Kevin Parker, City Council Member Jumaane D. Williams, Assembly Member Helene Weinstein and Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte. Farah Louis is the founder of Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization that offers educational workshops, programs and mentorship opportunities to prepare young women to become emerging global leaders and to ensure young women are mentally, emotionally and skillfully ready to compete in today’s challenging economic market. In 2018, Farah ran an aggressive campaign and was elected by the Flatbush residents as a Judicial Delegate for the 42nd Assembly District. In her role, she has coordinated judicial workshops to educate community on the judicial process and civil rights in the courts.  Fight for a progressive NYC.
