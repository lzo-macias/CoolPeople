Friday, April 25 Current Events    Calendar Community Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Elections Membership Officers Kevin’s Corner Enough is enough. Day after day, week after week, we have watched on tv or on our devices and read in the newspapers about  the thousands of misinformed, brainwashed, college kids who teamed up with outside trouble makers to destroy campus property, attack and bully Jewish students from attending class only because they want to learn at Columbia, NYU, FIT, The New School and many more. Such misguided hatred, and sadly the second highest elected official in New York City, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, was against the college presidents to call in the NYPD to stop the trespassing and violence.  He saw nothing going wrong. Law and order is something this man has a problem with.  This is down right scary. In a April 19 report in City and State New York, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said : “Protest is a right, civil disobedience, a powerful tool. And arrest at some point is a part of elevating the message.”  What ” message” is this man taking about ?  Intimidation,  insults , chaos  , hatred of Jewish people, hatred of Israel , hatred of America , hatred of capitalism ?  What a shame the taxpayers of the City of New York have to pay Williams $184,800 , and have him next in line to be mayor should the present mayor become unable to serve, according to the City Charter.  It is easy to see, Williams is not even close to being a leader.  Williams title should be changed from public advocate to public agitator. January 4, 2024 Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is a disgrace to the Democratic political party see belongs to, a disgrace to  the city she represents, and the voters that put their trust in her.  Why ? This progressive mayor likes to have Holiday/Christmas parties for city council members for non- white members only. That is what sadly happened during a time of year when we all should come together and celebrate joyfulness and togetherness , not rejection and segregation.  This reminds me of the old days in the segregated south, but this mean spirited mind set continues today under liberal Mayor Wu. Is the Attorney General of her state going to take action about this ? No. The Republican Party has a long history for civil rights. Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The 1960 Civil Right Act addressing voting rights of black Americans and penalties had big support from Republicans in the Senate—83% voted yes, 65% Democrats voted yes. In the House—81% Republicans voted yes. 59% Democrats voted yes. The 1964 Civil Rights Act which ended segregation in public places and employment discrimination , received big Republican support again. House Republicans 80% yes, Democrats 63% yes, Senate Republicans 82% yes, Democrats 69% yes. Lets not forget President Ronald Reagan who proudly signed  Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday. King, who advocated non-violence to promote human dignity and respect for everyone. I wonder what Dr. King would think of Mayor Wu. May 10, 2024 Mayor Adams has only himself to blame when he says ” It’s not going to get any better ” and ” Eventually this is going to come to a neighborhood near you”.  It was he who criticized Texas Governor Abbot for trying to halt illegal migrants from crossing the border, it was he who said he would welcome illegal migrants, it was he for the longest time backed Biden’s weak and non-existing border enforcement. Now the mayor has a crisis with people who have not been properly interviewed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities because Adams was never concerned about orderly border control just like our president. Now we have a financial, health, and security mess. We are a country of immigrants and that is what makes us a great country. Millions and millions of legal immigrants have contributed wonderful things to the U.S.A. and became proud productive legal citizens.  Is it too much to ask for orderly legal immigration ? August 16, 2023 Before I continue with this article, I want to start by making something very clear. Chinese Americans are a blessing to America. They have contributed enormously to medicine, science, art, education, business, technology, law, public service and so much more. They came here for freedom and opportunity. For many years they had to endure segregation, insults, and violence just because they wanted a better life and were more than willing to work hard honestly to achieve a better life. They are a cherished and remarkable part of our diverse American family. That said, I have a big problem with the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party. You thought $15 an hour is too low here in New York as a minimum wage ? Try getting by on $2.08 an hour in China or between $155 and $339 per month. Yes, some parts of the country have modestly higher minimum wages. How generous and kind of them ! Just as disappointing is this repressive undemocratic dictatorship that forces its citizens into silence and secrecy. Just try writing a letter to the editor criticizing the government. Good luck ! Jail will be your reward for peacefully speaking out. Freedom of the press ? I don’t think so. I find it humiliating and degrading that American companies have sold there businesses to Chinese business groups who are connected one way or another to the CCP. Companies such as AMC, Smithfield Foods, GE Appliances, Waldorf Astoria, Strategic Hotels and Resorts, Ingram Micro, Motorola Mobility, Starwood Hotels, Terex Corp. Lets not forget the endless list of U.S. based companies that make some or most of their products in China. Wealthy CEOs have shown their true colors and its not Red, White and Blue. Chinese owners controlled about 192,000 agricultural acres in the U.S. worth about $1.9 billion used for farming, ranching and forestry according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other foreign investors by the end of 2019 held more than 35 million acres, an area bigger than New York State ! According to Pharmacy Checker.com, 70% of popular branded name drugs sold in U.S. pharmacies are imported. Not a healthy situation we have put ourselves in to be so dependent and possibly cut off at a moments notice. Then what ? And lastly, New York Federal prosecutors recently announced charges against four Chinese companies selling chemicals that go into fentanyl . 440 pounds of these chemicals were seized, enough to kill 25 million Americans. June 27, 2023 Big bucks , little work. That is the mindset of Democratic Socialists Councilwoman Tiffany Caban of Astoria and Councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan of Harlem. Lets start with Caban. Her office is closed all the time, and when constituents show up with concerns, the place is locked up. Phone calls and e mails go unanswered. Where is everyone ?No one knows , but the residents of Astoria know office rents in their neighborhood are sky high and they are paying for her barely used office with their taxes. Maybe she is hiding somewhere try to drum up support for the abolition of NYPD’s Criminal Group Database, a bill she co-sponsored. She must feel that gangs and crime is not that big a problem. Really? The first 10 minutes of the nightly tv news is nothing but this ! The good news is help is on the way and Astoria’s suffering is about to end. Kelly Klingman is running against Caban and I predict an upset because Astoria is fed up with being ignored , and fed up feeling unsafe. The New York Post and Fox News have covered her campaign. Political clouds are hovering over Harlem too. Democratic Socialist Councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan does not like to work hard for the money either. Jordan missed 46% of her council committee and caucus meetings since last year. Like her fellow socialist Caban, she is not a big fan of the NYPD. The New York Post quoted her calling the NYPD “ the biggest gang in New York City “ and a “white supremacist institution.” ( Lefty Harlem pol is far ‘out’, 5/3/23 ) Last time I checked, our NYPD commissioner is not white , our mayor who appointed her is not white, the captain of the Harlem police precinct is not white, along with many other non white commanders who honorably protect everyone every day to keep us safe. At a salary of $148,500, Astoria and Harlem desperately need better representation in the City Council than what they have now. It cannot come soon enough ! May 22, 2023 So you thought vaping was safe and a nice alternative to smoking. Think again, its downright scary and potentially lethal. I did a little homework and this is what Cleveland Clinic, John Hopkins, and the CDC have to say. Vaping can cause asthma, lung scarring, organ damage to the heart and brain, raise blood pressure, narrow your arteries, addiction, gives second hand exposure , explosions because of the batteries in vaping devices which can cause serious injuries and burns, cancer, some of the ingredients in e-liquids are known to cause cancer, evali, which is a lung condition that vaping causes, it includes symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Worst of all evali can be fatal. The vape juice sometimes contain flavors that have nickel, tin, cadmium, along with ultrafine tiny particles that get into your lungs. It may even include benzene, a chemical found in car exhaust ! According to the CDC, confirmed as of 1/14/20 ,of the 2,022 hospitalized patients, 82% reported using THC containing products, 33% reported exclusive use of THC containing products, a mind altering chemical. In February 2020 the CDC confirmed 2,807 cases of e-cigarette or vaping use associated lung injury and 68 deaths. So with all of these facts that have been discovered, one has to ask why is this garbage allowed to be sold in pot shops , vaping shops, and smoke shops ? You know the answer, its all about the money, tax money to be hustled at the expense of people’s health. There are some things we have to take notice of. Notice the Democratic Party always rails against the Republicans for being against health issues. Notice how quiet our New York City and New York State Health commissioners are about vaping, and they are doctors. Notice there are no city or state funded commercials with these two doctors warning against how vicious vaping is. Notice these two doctors do not have the courage to recommend vaping should be outlawed. Notice these two doctors are nothing more than go-along get-along Adams and Hochul loyalists while THEY NOTICE thousands destroying themselves. April 23, 2023 Lets get the conversation going !  First up of my concerns here in Queens is the unfortunate and unwanted  opening of pot shops in our neighborhoods. The vast majority are illegal , making money off the books. The governor and the mayor thought this was going to be tax goldmine , it backfired. It’s not only a money looser that is out of control, it is making people unhealthy, very unhealthy. But don’t take my word for it, take a look at what the Center For Disease Control  has to say about marijuana :  “ People who use  marijuana are more likely to develop temporary psychosis and long -lasting mental disorders, including schizophrenia. The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is strong in people who start using marijuana at an earlier age and use marijuana more frequently. Marijuana use has also been linked to depression, social anxiety, and thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts and suicide. Smoked marijuana, regardless of how it is smoked, can harm the lung tissues and cause scarring and damage to small blood vessels. Marijuana can make the heart  beat faster and make blood pressure higher immediately after use. It could also lead   increased risk of stroke, heart disease and vascular diseases. Recent marijuana use within 24 hours in youth and adults has an immediate impact on thinking, attention, memory, coordination, movement, and time perception. “  This is how our governor and mayor want to grab tax revenue.  This is how they want to increase our quality of life ? This is how they will make us feel safe ? This is an example of good government for school kids ?  This will help students excel ? This will ease the crowding in emergency rooms ?  The tax scheme did not work. Its time to shut down the pot shops. March 28, 2023 Enough is enough. Day after day, week after week, we have watched on tv or on our devices and read in the newspapers about  the thousands of misinformed, brainwashed, college kids who teamed up with outside trouble makers to destroy campus property, attack and bully Jewish students from attending class only because they want to learn at Columbia, NYU, FIT, The New School and many more.

And lastly, New York Federal prosecutors recently announced charges against four Chinese companies selling chemicals that go into fentanyl . 440 pounds of these chemicals were seized, enough to kill 25 million Americans. June 27, 2023 Big bucks , little work. That is the mindset of Democratic Socialists Councilwoman Tiffany Caban of Astoria and Councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan of Harlem. Lets start with Caban. Her office is closed all the time, and when constituents show up with concerns, the place is locked up. Phone calls and e mails go unanswered. Where is everyone ?No one knows , but the residents of Astoria know office rents in their neighborhood are sky high and they are paying for her barely used office with their taxes. Maybe she is hiding somewhere try to drum up support for the abolition of NYPD’s Criminal Group Database, a bill she co-sponsored. She must feel that gangs and crime is not that big a problem. Really? The first 10 minutes of the nightly tv news is nothing but this ! The good news is help is on the way and Astoria’s suffering is about to end. Kelly Klingman is running against Caban and I predict an upset because Astoria is fed up with being ignored , and fed up feeling unsafe. The New York Post and Fox News have covered her campaign. Political clouds are hovering over Harlem too. Democratic Socialist Councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan does not like to work hard for the money either. Jordan missed 46% of her council committee and caucus meetings since last year. Like her fellow socialist Caban, she is not a big fan of the NYPD. The New York Post quoted her calling the NYPD “ the biggest gang in New York City “ and a “white supremacist institution.” ( Lefty Harlem pol is far ‘out’, 5/3/23 ) Last time I checked, our NYPD commissioner is not white , our mayor who appointed her is not white, the captain of the Harlem police precinct is not white, along with many other non white commanders who honorably protect everyone every day to keep us safe. At a salary of $148,500, Astoria and Harlem desperately need better representation in the City Council than what they have now. It cannot come soon enough ! May 22, 2023 So you thought vaping was safe and a nice alternative to smoking. Think again, its downright scary and potentially lethal. I did a little homework and this is what Cleveland Clinic, John Hopkins, and the CDC have to say. Vaping can cause asthma, lung scarring, organ damage to the heart and brain, raise blood pressure, narrow your arteries, addiction, gives second hand exposure , explosions because of the batteries in vaping devices which can cause serious injuries and burns, cancer, some of the ingredients in e-liquids are known to cause cancer, evali, which is a lung condition that vaping causes, it includes symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Worst of all evali can be fatal. The vape juice sometimes contain flavors that have nickel, tin, cadmium, along with ultrafine tiny particles that get into your lungs. It may even include benzene, a chemical found in car exhaust ! According to the CDC, confirmed as of 1/14/20 ,of the 2,022 hospitalized patients, 82% reported using THC containing products, 33% reported exclusive use of THC containing products, a mind altering chemical. In February 2020 the CDC confirmed 2,807 cases of e-cigarette or vaping use associated lung injury and 68 deaths. So with all of these facts that have been discovered, one has to ask why is this garbage allowed to be sold in pot shops , vaping shops, and smoke shops ? You know the answer, its all about the money, tax money to be hustled at the expense of people’s health. There are some things we have to take notice of. Notice the Democratic Party always rails against the Republicans for being against health issues. Notice how quiet our New York City and New York State Health commissioners are about vaping, and they are doctors. Notice there are no city or state funded commercials with these two doctors warning against how vicious vaping is. Notice these two doctors do not have the courage to recommend vaping should be outlawed. Notice these two doctors are nothing more than go-along get-along Adams and Hochul loyalists while THEY NOTICE thousands destroying themselves. April 23, 2023 Lets get the conversation going !  First up of my concerns here in Queens is the unfortunate and unwanted  opening of pot shops in our neighborhoods. The vast majority are illegal , making money off the books. The governor and the mayor thought this was going to be tax goldmine , it backfired. It’s not only a money looser that is out of control, it is making people unhealthy, very unhealthy. But don’t take my word for it, take a look at what the Center For Disease Control  has to say about marijuana :  “ People who use  marijuana are more likely to develop temporary psychosis and long -lasting mental disorders, including schizophrenia. The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is strong in people who start using marijuana at an earlier age and use marijuana more frequently. Marijuana use has also been linked to depression, social anxiety, and thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts and suicide. Smoked marijuana, regardless of how it is smoked, can harm the lung tissues and cause scarring and damage to small blood vessels. Marijuana can make the heart  beat faster and make blood pressure higher immediately after use. It could also lead   increased risk of stroke, heart disease and vascular diseases. Recent marijuana use within 24 hours in youth and adults has an immediate impact on thinking, attention, memory, coordination, movement, and time perception. “  This is how our governor and mayor want to grab tax revenue.  This is how they want to increase our quality of life ? This is how they will make us feel safe ? This is an example of good government for school kids ?  This will help students excel ? This will ease the crowding in emergency rooms ?  The tax scheme did not work. Its time to shut down the pot shops. March 28, 2023 |

The agenda of the Democrat party left, center or right is simple (Notice, I did not say Democratic Party). The agenda is to change the demographics of American elections, gain more seats in the House and Senate, re-arrange congressional districts and import illegally anyone who will vote for them now or in the future. Anyone of these illegals would be eternally grateful and thank the Democrats by voting for them forever. It is that simple.

The Democrat party under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did not serve the people who brought them to Congress but served the Democrat ideology at any cost which turned out to be deadly. They are ideologues and not servants of the people who pay their salaries and are supposed to work for the people and not the party. They betrayed th...

Many Americans are afraid that the tariff war started by President Trump will be a disaster but let's look at the facts. The tariff war is temporary and the stock market will recover. Already 3 trillion +/- foreign dollars have been committed in less than one week by foreign corporations to move and build their operations here in the United States because of President Trump's tariff war where he wants parity with each country that slaps tariffs on us. 70 countries already capitulated as of today April 9, 2025 and are coming to the negotiation table. The European Union of 27 nations has indicated they are ready to negotiate.

Yes Lincoln held the Union together and  freed 4 million  slaves, that was death defying and  monumental but President Donald J. Trump is freeing all Americans, 340 million from the tyranny of the left wing radical, "progressive" anti American domestic terrorist  and foreign interference to our democracy more than the number of slaves that were freed.

The agenda of the Democrat party left, center or right is simple (Notice, I did not say Democratic Party). The agenda is to change the demographics of American elections, gain more seats in the House and Senate, re-arrange congressional districts and import illegally anyone who will vote for them now or in the future. Anyone of these illegals would be eternally grateful and thank the Democrats by voting for them forever. It is that simple.

The Democrat party under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did not serve the people who brought them to Congress but served the Democrat ideology at any cost which turned out to be deadly. They are ideologues and not servants of the people who pay their salaries and are supposed to work for the people and not the party. They betrayed th...

Certainly Not Democratic! 8 Apr By Stan Norwalk 4 Comments Welcome Is President Trump’s Tariff War Failing ? Many Americans are afraid that the tariff war started by President Trump will be a disaster but let's look at the facts. The tariff war is temporary and the stock market will recover. Already 3 trillion +/- foreign dollars have been committed in less than one week by foreign corporations to move and build their operations here in the United States because of President Trump's tariff war where he wants parity with each country that slaps tariffs on us. 70 countries already capitulated as of today April 9, 2025 and are coming to the negotiation table. The European Union of 27 nations has indicated they are ready to negotiate.

President Trump said the only way he will negotiate with the EU is if the European Union wipes out the American debt of 350 billion dollars by buying American oil an...

Trump Should Go Down As The Greatest American President in History? Why is Donald J. Trump the greatest American president in history? Lincoln and Washington are up there if not along side of Donald J. Trump and there are other great presidents amongst our founding fathers that were incredible facing death to free us from tyranny by the British  and writing some of the greatest documents in history that live on till today.

Yes Lincoln held the Union together and  freed 4 million  slaves, that was death defying and  monumental but President Donald J. Trump is freeing all Americans, 340 million from the tyranny of the left wing radical, "progressive" anti American domestic terrorist  and foreign interference to our democracy more than the number of slaves that were freed.

President Trump has done more in his first month  in office than President Biden did in 4 years. Biden's legacy is he took more vacation time off almost 40 percent of his days in office more than any other President ; That's a 3 day work week .He woke up late, went to bed early, did not get the Russians and Ukrainians to the peace table, did not attempt to bring the space astronauts back to earth, did not go after the Houthis who closed down the shipping lanes in the Red Sea forcing shipping commerce to avoid the Suez canal and to travel 2 extra weeks around the Cape of Good Hope of Africa costing more wages, diesel fuel, time to get goods to market and bring the cost of living up.

Do you like closed borders and the deportation of criminal illegal migrant invaders that were killing, robbing, raping, trafficking  guns, drugs, children and woman and responsible for the deaths of anywhere from 110,000 to 300,000 Americans (estimates)from fentanyl ? Exact numbers are not known. President Trump thinks it could be upward towards 300,000.

Trump is redeploying tens of thousands of IRS agents from auditing the middle class to squeeze money to pay for the overrun costs and debts to pay for the illegal aliens and housing them in prisons and hotels to secure our borders instead. You no longer have to be afraid of IRS agents in huge numbers coming for you.

The agenda of the Democrat party left, center or right is simple (Notice, I did not say Democratic Party). The agenda is to change the demographics of American elections, gain more seats in the House and Senate, re-arrange congressional districts and import illegally anyone who will vote for them now or in the future. Anyone of these illegals would be eternally grateful and thank the Democrats by voting for them forever. It is that simple.

The Democrat party under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did not serve the people who brought them to Congress but served the Democrat ideology at any cost which turned out to be deadly. They are ideologues and not servants of the people who pay their salaries and are supposed to work for the people and not the party. They betrayed th...

Many Americans are afraid that the tariff war started by President Trump will be a disaster but let's look at the facts. The tariff war is temporary and the stock market will recover. Already 3 trillion +/- foreign dollars have been committed in less than one week by foreign corporations to move and build their operations here in the United States because of President Trump's tariff war where he wants parity with each country that slaps tariffs on us. 70 countries already capitulated as of today April 9, 2025 and are coming to the negotiation table. The European Union of 27 nations has indicated they are ready to negotiate.

President Trump said the only way he will negotiate with the EU is if the European Union wipes out the American debt of 350 billion dollars by buying American oil an...

Lincoln and Washington are up there if not along side of Donald J. Trump and there are other great presidents amongst our founding fathers that were incredible facing death to free us from tyranny by the British  and writing some of the greatest documents in history that live on till today.

Yes Lincoln held the Union together and  freed 4 million  slaves, that was death defying and  monumental but President Donald J. Trump is freeing all Americans, 340 million from the tyranny of the left wing radical, "progressive" anti American domestic terrorist  and foreign interference to our democracy more than the number of slaves that were freed.

Do you like closed borders and the deportation of criminal illegal migrant invaders that were killing, robbing, raping, trafficking  guns, drugs, children and woman and responsible for the deaths of anywhere from 110,000 to 300,000 Americans (estimates)from fentanyl ? Exact numbers are not known. President Trump thinks it could be upward towards 300,000.

Trump is redeploying tens of thousands of IRS agents from auditing the middle class to squeeze money to pay for the overrun costs and debts to pay for the illegal aliens and housing them in prisons and hotels to secure our borders instead. You no longer have to be afraid of IRS agents in huge numbers coming for you.

Friday, April 25 Current Events    Calendar Community Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Elections Membership Officers Sophia Worrell February 1, 2024 APPRECIATING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY The United States of America has become a beacon of hope for every country in the world but now that it is on the brink of its own collapse, not one single country is coming to its rescue! It is undeniable, that Americans are the most accommodating and generous people in all of the world. They have been raised to help those who are less fortunate than themselves. But how has that generosity been repaid? In a country where not only, horizontal mobility is available, but upward mobility can be achieved with hard work and preservation, no matter the background of the individual, the American way of life has been bashed and the people that made it all possible, is browbeaten. Americans are accused of being plunders and racist and yet many people are breaking into this country to enjoy the wealth and prosperity that they have not contributed towards. It is stated that the American society was built on immigration. Yet, no one stops to analyze what conditions the first immigrants met and that maybe, just maybe, they came and found a barren land and had to start from scratch to build a civilization that we all take for granted right now. By Sophia K. Worrell ************************************************************* February 2, 2024 THE POPULATION & ETHOS OF AMERICA The United States of America is a Constitutional Republic which has a system of ‘consent by the governed’ made up of a majority of white European people and a minority of other groups consisting of Asian, Spanish, Indian and black people. White Americans constitutes the majority of the people in the United States. According to the 2020 census, 71%, or 235,411,507 people, were a combination, or 61.6%, or 204,277,273 people, were White alone. The U.S. Hispanic population reached 62.1 million in 2020, an increase of 23% over the previous decade. The Black population of the United States is stagnant. In 2022, there were an estimated 47.9 million people who self-identified as black American-born, making up 11.4% of the country’s population. As of 2016, about 13 million — about 4% of the total U.S. population — have Caribbean ancestry, consisting of people of Indian descent and black persons. In 2020, the Asian population reported approximately 19.9 million or 7.2% of the total population. The ethos of white European is about taking risks. This has allowed them to create institutions that elevated them above all other ethnic groups. The ability to do research in all kinds of conditions and climates, to explore seas and lands in order to present the data needed to build institutions, has elevated white people over other ethnic groups of people. The concerted effort to tear down instead of add value is regulated to a tiny sub-sect of people who are afraid to take the chance to be pioneers. This is not the case with white men who had a vision of a life beyond being nomads, living in tents, huts, pulling water from wells and wearing animals’ skins. It was the Dutch, then the French, next Spain and finally Britain which took the risk to explore the world and have established a civilization that is second-to-none in these great United States of America.

The Apostle Paul stated, “If a man does not work, he should not eat.” But in a country with great wealth and prosperity, many people seem comfortable to live on welfare programs, public assistance and entitlement benefits and yet, complain about the people who have opened work opportunities in all kinds of genres. In many countries, there are what is generally known as traditional jobs. Sports and entertainment are a pastime and is limited to a singing career at best. In the United States, a person has the opportunity to make a lucrative career in unconventional work in the arts and sports. If a person can think of a need and fill it, they can build a business that will bring them great success and prosperity. There is no limitation on the imagination. This freedom of market system has allowed capitalism to pull many people out of poverty. But where did this mindset originate from? Was it Africans who developed and supported the efforts of people who had the idea to invent, innovate and produce products and services of every kind? Was it Latinos who decided that an individual could excel in acting, playing a game, writing a book or painting a picture? Was it Asians who encourage their fellowman to start a small business and then grow it into a corporation, or to go a step further and expand that model in several different locations or to take it to the next level of building franchises? Was it West Indians who came up with the means of transacting so as to mitigate fair dealings between the owner and customer, the owner and the supplier and the owner and the bank. The ability to risk delving into every category of work and deliberating a cost that meets the skill is to be credited to white European men. Love them or hate them, no other third world country can boast of what this first-world nation of America has perfected. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 4, 2024 MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD We are wonderfully made. The scripture verse in Psalm 139:14 reads: “I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful; I know that full well.”  In a fallen world, there will be people who understand the importance of taking care of this world and their bodies and others will not pay as much attention. However, this verse is a reminder that we are all unique and special in our own way. It is a testament to the beauty of God’s creation and the importance of self-love and the ability to love the people and things that are around us. For example, many people appreciate the falling of the snow and the rain showers. They know that the rain and sun fulfil a purpose. These elements are not there to disrupt our day, but to help the foliage, the animals, birds and human beings as a whole. As children, we enjoyed the rain drops on the roof and the snow falling on the ground. They were extensions of play. Somehow as adults, they have become impediments to getting from one place to another. The indifference to the world around us, has seemingly been carried over to the care of our bodies. The lack of exercise, attention to diet and proper grooming habits is leading to health issues where pharmaceuticals and medication is taking the place of proper rest and appreciation for what our body-machinery. Instead of preventing health issues, there is more of an after-thought towards maintenance as work and day to day activities are the excuse for why the body is breaking down. Is it possible to return to being like little children, even as adults. Is it possible, to stop and smell the roses? Yes, if we make a conscious effort to do so. When I lived in the Caribbean, the beach was a minute walk away, the sun, moon and stars were visible each day. I took it for granted. I have to intentionally look up to see the moon. Now that I am in this big city, I have to commute to go to the beach. I am learning to find the tradeoffs in this city. Like a child, I am forced to be curious about my surroundings again and to enjoy new ways of amusing myself. And I am finding that it is not as hard to take care of myself, and to find pleasure in the earth I live on. How about you? By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 5, 2024 RECLAIMING LANGUAGE Language is very important to any society. It is how people communicate information, discuss problems, debate ideas and gather data. There are verbal and non-verbal cues. The use of words, structured in a particular way is how we engage in conversation with others. In English, we use the letters of the alphabet to construct words, string sentences together and create paragraphs. Words are used to define people, places and things. We call the name of a person or an object a noun . We explain an action with a verb . We combine two phrases with a conjunction . We provide more information about a noun with an adjective and we describe a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or even a whole sentence by using an adverb . There are many words where the meaning has to be looked up in a dictionary. Non-verbal cues can sometimes be easily interpreted, as with a smile, the wagging tail of a dog or a stern look. These agreed upon verbal and non-verbal cues have been accepted for centuries. It is what makes for a civil society. Navigating life on a daily basis can be challenging and so it is important for some things to remain constant. A growing child, a teenager and an adult come into many different systems each day and every one of them have their own organizational structure. Courtesies like good morning, goodbye and thank you are stables in a functioning society. The way we function at home, operate in school and navigate at work, calls for the individuals to be respectful of their parents & family, teachers & peers, employers & coworkers. Paying attention to time, space and roles in each of these areas elicit behaviors that convey respect that will be given back. The rules of engagement have been very clearly defined and acceptable until a few short years ago. Now every norm, and proper use of language and cues are seemingly being incrementally dismantled where there are no rules and people are offended if speech or actions are not politically correct. The people who are most offended, have never explained in any tangible way what the term of engagement are, and yet everyone is forced to comply without push back or be cancelled forever. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 6, 2024 THE FORCES OF GOOD & EVIL There are two forces in this life—the force of good and the force of evil. Christians have an explanation for why things go wrong and offer God as the Creator to realign our lives. Just as we go to history books to learn about prominent figures, “believers in Jesus Christ” point to the Bible to understand how this world came into being.  After creating the world, God created the first man called Adam and the first woman called Eve. Before God rested from all of his work, he looked at all he created, and called it good. We have a starting point for how evil was unleashed as well. Continuing in the scriptures, we read of the angel Lucifer seeking to exalt himself against the God who created him because he was envious of the Trinity and his position as the angel of music. Since then, human beings have been entangled between the battle of good and evil. God was upfront with Adam and Eve. His instructions were very simple and spoken with love. Here is the world I created for you to enjoy, partake of every fruit, except the tree of knowledge of good and evil , name the animals and I will meet with you in the cool of the day. The man and the woman lived with the animals and there was no fear for their safety. They were naked and had no awareness, just as the animals had no covering for their naked bodies. However, when the devil (who was once Lucifer), came to Eve, he hid his intentions. He hid in the body of a serpent. He obfuscated the truth. He preyed on the woman’s curiosity. What was the reason for the devil disguising himself and not revealing his scheme? The devil has severed ties with God and there is no restoration for him. His intention is to bring everyone down with him as he did the other angels. So how do we measure good and evil? Both of these actions are concepts. They can be judged by the body’s response to either one. The emotion that stems from doing good is a feeling that denotes well-being. The emotion that comes from bad is the opposite feeling of distress. Relief and pain are opposing factors. Good is outright, it shares, it explains, it brings evidence, it answers questions, it invites criticism and suggestions, it pivots if needed and it grows. Bad hides, it lies, it deflects, it shames, it has no answer or explanation, it doubles down, it is hard to change, it shrivels up and dies. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 7, 2024 INSTITUTIONS MADE AMERICA GREAT There are eight things that makes countries weak: (1) Having A Small Armed Force, (2) Being A Geographically Small Country, (3) Having A Small Population, (4) Having A Weak Government, (5) A Small Economy, (6) Having Bad Infrastructure, (7) Having A Divided Population and (8) Bad Geography Location. On the other hand, the opposite is true for strong countries with a large landmass, have large population, is strategically situated, resulting in a better economy. The difference between what constitutes as a weak country and why another is strong is the establishing of institutions.  An Institution is a society or organization founded for religious, educational, social, or business purposes. It can be an established official organization having a vital role in the life of a country, such as a bank, church, legislature or it can be an established law, practice, or custom. Institutions are also the formal rules that organize social, political, and economic relations which include the written laws, regulations, legal agreements and contracts which constitutes what is enforced by third parties, while informal institutions are the usually unwritten norms, procedures, conventions, and traditions that are often embedded in culture. These practices are implicit and drive incentives, norms and behaviors. They determine economic, legal, political, and social rights and opportunities. For nations to prosper, economic and political institutions must work hand in hand to benefit the citizens who participate in the moving of products and delivery of services. When even the common man can have skin in the game, virtuous cycles can be established. Institutions determine the guidelines and requirements for products and services. There is a criterion that is put in place which measures productivity and industry standards. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 8, 2024 THE VALUE OF WORK A simple google search breaks down a society as a group of individuals engaged in persistent social interaction or a large social group that shares the same spatial or social territory. The inhabitants consist of people who live close together and interact with one another. These individuals form the building blocks of social structures. The culture encompasses the shared beliefs, customs, traditions, language, art, and values within a society. It shapes how people perceive the world, how they interact with each other, and express themselves. In every society, there must be material products, such as tools, technology, architecture, clothing, and art. These artifacts reflect the collective creativity and practical needs of the community. And of course, social institutions are established in the form of family, education, religion, government, and the economy. Social institutions provide stability and guidelines for behavior. All of these social organizations refer to the patterns of relationships and roles within a society within a hierarchy of family structures, social classes, and a division of labor. These arrangements help maintain order and functionality through law enforcement. Adjustment to these structures have to be taught. The home is the first informal learning institution in which parents teach, guide and assist their growing child to understand what is expected of them. The different levels of schooling from kindergarten to high school and later unto higher education or trade schools is where formal learning takes place with the help of teachers, tutors, professors and principals. In order for a society to meet the needs of its populace, people must become skilled in a multitude of jobs. The day-to-day operational tasks has to be taught by breaking down what is expected through physical and mental labor, in order to maintain the means of production when workers change careers, get sick, retire, get injured or pass away. The problem is that individuals are not well-informed on how to manage their personal lives and their own finances. There is a disconnect between the value that individuals add to their civilization and the effect on the economy which is the lifeblood of every society. For instance, there was a time when parents taught children the value of work and earning money. The process must be restored. The little child was given an allowance to spend on trifles. Then they were given an allowance for doing chores. Later, as teenagers, parents allowed them to run errands for family members or help out their neighbors for a small fee. By the time they were adolescents, the father would hire them in his own business or encourage them to do afterschool jobs and summer work if he was himself, employed. Young people graduated to volunteering with non-profits, taking on apprenticeship work or internships long before their thought about entering college or going to a trade school or academy. Young men learned the value of work, by observing their father go off to work.  Young ladies learned the value of taking care of the home by watching their mother maintain the house. They gained the necessary experience by working inside and outside of the home. They received the foundational skills to budget, spend wisely, save and invest their earnings. And most of all, they obtained people skills by the various customer service skills they engaged in. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 9, 2024 FEMINISM AND THE DOWNFALL OF SOCIETY The feminist movement pontificated that “It is a man’s world” and hollered that most corporate jobs, (and for some reason, not the dirty, hard jobs), were male dominated and women were not getting equal pay for equal work. Along with attacks on men were the shaming of women who wanted to stay at home to take care of their husbands and children. Of course, it did not matter that females are child-bearers, and the miracle of birth is still the most fascinating thing in life. These feminists totally ignored the fact that the only way people come into this world is by a man inseminating a woman where she becomes pregnant with a little human being.  Feminists seem to miss the tiny fact that men still faithfully go out and work and someone has to stay home with the baby. And of course, it does not matter that the females who buy into their rhetoric has become more disgruntled over the years as they ignore their instincts and longings. The rantings of feminists are very incoherent. The date has not and cannot be substantiated by them. That is simply because they have an agenda to break up what God has designed—that is; the man to be the protector and the provider and the woman to be the homemaker and the nurturer. A child born into a home with a father and a mother is the backbone of every society. From time past and into eternity, females have an innate yearn to have babies. And that yearning makes it impossible to fully compete with men. The only way to do so is to give up that desire to have a child in pursuit of a career and that usually leaves a hole in a woman’s heart and soul, (I have heard it said way too many times by women who don’t have children). Feminists pretend that women are all alone in this process and accuse all men as being creeps. They take isolated cases and lump them together as a way to push their agenda. There is never any discussion to hold women accountable for their actions, but always to blame men although in many cases, women are consenting partners. In proper relationships, planning is done where both spouses discuss the point where children will enter the relationship. When done right, the women will not be left to bear the responsibility of raising the child alone. In this planning process, she has a period of time to join the workforce before becoming getting married and later becoming pregnant. There are already provisions in the work environment for women to take time off to deliver her baby and then take additional time to care for the helpless newborn. It is understood that mothers with little children may have a challenge when asked to do overtime and bosses are sensitive to their dilemma. Once articulated to the employer, women are given grace to take youngsters to school and pick them up, as everyone is aware of the need for underaged children to be supervised. It is the law. Promotions may not be in the cards for her at that time if she cannot stay late or come in on short notice, if she confidently explains that she would have to scramble for a sitter. It is for this reason, that most women apply for jobs that would parallel the time that children are in school so that they could be available to meet the child’s needs. These feminists know all of this but chose to turn a blind-eye to all the reasons why most jobs are male-dominated. The simple fact is that men accept that they have go out to work unlike women who complain about their lot in life. Feminists ignore the fact that unlike men who are ridiculed if they are not providers, women have options. She can fully choose the option of staying home with the children when she gets married. She can work parttime as the children get older, while her husband provides the finances for the home. And she can return to fulltime employment when the children are grown and compliment his earnings if they both see the need. She can even start a small business while at home. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman being in the home and taking care of her family. But the rhetoric has worked and now there is a fractured society. Now we are living in a “woman’s world” where chaos and high emotions drive norms. Is it working? I think not. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 10, 2024 CIVIL LIBERTIES & CIVIL RIGHTS There are generally two sides of every issue. However, the ability to look at subjects from every angle seems nonexistent. The situations in this country that was a subject of contention and thought resolved has come back to the front again and every topic is deemed as highly sensitive and untouchable by some groups of people.  Slavery is one of these nagging issues that people cannot let go of and discrimination against black people and women, (especially by white men), has now risen to a point where they must be excommunicated from society and sent to the annals of hell.  Any opposing view to the contrary is met with victual and endless seething. Slavery had existed since antiquity and flourished in many parts of the world. Some slaves were captured in war or by piracy. The Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptians, Africans were sold by other Africans, in western Asia, parents sold their children out of poverty into servitude and many in the Balkans became slaves when their land was devasted by Ottoman invasions. Slaves could be Greek, Slav, European, African or Turkish. Many served as domestics, others sweated as galley slaves and many others worked on plantations. This is not just a black problem. There was segregation in the United States and in 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed. This landmark civil rights and labor law in the United States outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. With passage of a new Reconstruction Act in March 1867, the era of Radical, or Congressional, Reconstruction, began. Over the next decade, Black Americans voted in huge numbers across the South, electing a total of 22 Black men to serve in the U.S. Congress and two in the Senate. The feminist movement was and is a social and political campaign for radical and liberal reforms on so-called women’s issues on the pretense of inequality between men and women. The broad-brush paints reproductive rights, domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women’s suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence as issues affecting women. In the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides certain employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, while paid maternity leave is typically provided voluntarily by employers. Nationally, in 1920 with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, women were given the right to vote. The Holocaust was the genocide of European Jews during World War II. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population. The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Chełmno in occupied Poland. And yet, Jewish people have emerged as the most stable community all across the world. The patriarchy is blamed for all or most of the problems in the world. But who is the patriarchy? The definition of patriarchy is a social system in which positions of dominance and privilege are held by men. But what about the men who went to war and died or lost their limbs, or the men who dug the tunnels for the railroads, or the men who risk their lives to understand how the world around them worked, or the men who spend countless hours on the road in trucking to deliver products, or the men who patrol the streets and put their lives on the line to protect regular citizens, or the men who rush into burning buildings, or the men who risk their finances to build a business, or the men who study for years to be specialist in medicine, or the men who spend countless hours to fly people all over the world, or men who transport people all across the state and country, or the men who are out on ships to protect the homeland, or the men who work the trades that are not so glamorous to ensure that the lights stay on, the phone service is constant and that the water supply never dries up, or the men who walk for miles to ensure that there are no train derailments? Where is the dominance and privilege when the ship is sinking, and the patriarchy has to stand back as the women and children are the ones who go into lifeboats first? And where is it now, after men of kinds and stripes has used their minds and bodies to give us the best civilization in the world? It is time that the matriarchy appreciates what the patriarchy has done and focus on what our job is all about. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 11, 2024 THE PRIVATE SECTOR/PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE U.S. In the United States of America, there is the private sector and the public sector. The private sector encompasses businesses and enterprises that are privately owned and operated for profit, managed by individuals and in some cases, answers to members of boards and shareholders. Whereas the public sector is the part of the economy that the government operates, funded through the taxes of its citizens. It was set up to provide public goods and services, such as national defense, law enforcement, public education, and infrastructure development. The funds collected by taxes are then allocated to various government budgets. In America, the government is funded by and answers to we the people . Every working person goes to a job and is either the employer or the employee. Even the individual who works for himself, answers to his customers. There are steps to starting any business. The basic components comprise of identifying a business idea, conducting market research, writing a business plan, choosing both a business structure and a location.  The operator of a business adheres to the rules and regulations for hiring and firing of staff, serving clients and customers and engaging with vendors. Those seeking employment go through the hiring process of submitting a resume and scheduling an interview. They bring experience and a willingness to add value to the company they desire to work in. It is the means of production in the private sector which ensures that people are able to take care of their basic needs for food, shelter and clothing. Since the goal of the employer is to make a profit and the objective of the employee is to earn a salary, then every transaction is centered around good customer service to meet that threshold. This keeps everyone accountable to their agreement of quality of service. It was the private sector that created the public sector. After America gained its independence from Britain, the thirteen colonies created the federal government to protect citizens from outside interference in order to provide for citizens’ well-being and happiness. They wanted the assurance to live safely, move freely and operate securely as they went about their daily duties and activities. It is through the process of campaigning that persons wishing to enter public service do so out of concern to strengthen national defense, further promote the education of minors, continue the commitment for justice and adequate law enforcement systems, as well ensuring that the development of broken infrastructures is carried out and maintained. This desire for the improvement and further advancement of the country’s economy and standing in the world should be the driving force for entering the government. This means that the process is started months or years before the filing deadline. Preferably, the person would have been involved in neighborhood associations and have participated in community work. They would either have made the choice or better yet, been asked to run for public office because of their ties to the community. The work of fixing laws, bridges, roads, rail, buildings, maintaining the streets to be free of litter and attending to the less fortunate and challenged in society, is best done by people who have shown integrity to the cause and loyalty to people who pay taxes and want to see their money spent appropriately as allocated for the benefit of the populus as a whole. But overtime, politicians have abused their positions and have allowed the American society to fall apart as they send money all across the world and line their pockets along the way. They no longer answer to voters who were under the impression that they were electing these supposed public servants. Politicians openly defy regular citizens and cower to the donors who selected them. The smug look on their faces sends the message that they are untouchable to the voter. But the jig is up. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 12, 2024 IS AMERICA BECOMING A COMMUNIST NATION What does a communist country look like? It has people in the federal government who print massive amounts of money pretending to send aid packages all over the world but are really pocketing half of the funds. It has people at the state and local level, who open their state to illegal aliens under the guise of being a sanctuary city and then giving them all kinds of free stuff and handouts so as to use them as a permanent voting base when they want to cheat. It is a system of government that have used the plight of illiterate people against themselves, by introducing programs like free money to support women who get children from a man, but the man does not have to support those children. It involves erecting buildings and paying people to live freely in apartments without having any obligation that they are responsible for managing their affairs. It translates into paying for free schooling and college but instead of teaching the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic to students, they are indoctrinated with everything else that does not convert into them becoming a thinking and independent adult. And finally, communism is about paying people to stay home, instead of working. What is the reason for maintaining an underclass of people? It gives people in government permanent power at the expense of a group of people in the population who lives in fear of the boogie man. But if you have working brain cells, you, the reader maybe thinking or saying to yourself that someone has to work. I agree. Of course, in every communist society, people are going about their work, but there are those who work as part of the communist regime, while others are clueless to what is actually going on behind the scenes. The work in public offices, like hospitals, schools, shelters, and government agencies provides services to the underclass. These workers are taught that these grown people need help and so the workers think that they are the saviors of people who never got a foot up in life. The result is that workers in these agencies feel a sense of superiority as they swoop in to help the so-called less fortunate and an alliance is formed. What happens to this kind of communist society overtime? It eventually falls in on itself, because it is unsustainable. Babies become children and children become adults and must be expected to behave like adults who can take care of themselves and are responsible for their actions to themselves and to their fellowman.  It is not the job of government to suckle people from the womb to the tomb, but that is what the city of New York has become. A “Nanny State”. For the most part, too many black Americans have become subdued by accepting welfare and handouts. The flood gates to people from the Thirdworld has exasperated the problem because the assimilation process has been watered down.  The fusion of underclass and second-class has been taken hold. Are there any ordinary people in a communist society? Yes, there will always be businesses, and those who work in the private sector, but those people are heavily taxed to pay for a section of the population that has never seen the value in work. This is not what the Founders of the United States of America had in mind for people who wanted to join this great experiment. This is excerpt of what the American identity and way of life was intended to be: “The idea behind America is that people are allowed to come here, live here and be here so as to express themselves in ways that build a legacy not only for the individual but for the treasures of America. The American way is to become great. The principle behind becoming great is that great people make a great nation. The rule is that Americans believe that greatness brings wealth and build resources, and through the individual prosperity, the nation will benefit. The tenet is that no one is restricted, if they have some idea or talent, because it is their wellspring that lays the groundwork for the riches that America, as a whole, relishes”. It is time to restore the city of New York to its glory as the central figure of America! By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 13, 2024 FAILING INSTITUTIONS These articles are for the sole purpose of reflecting and appreciating how great and powerful America is and why this is a fact. No other island or country in the world rivals that of the United States of America and yet, those who live here and come here are oblivious to what these 50 states represent.  In traveling to different states, it boggles the mind how different each state is in terms of its landscape and people. The perception of America that is held before landing on these shores is vastly different than actually being here. There is still untapped resources and beautiful landscapes that rival pictures, movies, videos or anyone’s perspective. There are many people who still appreciate this land, but far too many who do not understand the sacrifice of those who have gone before. Every landmark, institution and corporation resonate with stories of all these people in some form or fashion. But there is a disconnect and it is vital that we address where the failure started.  The power of the media in America is stronger than any other place that I visited or lived. In America, the media has been created to keep the population informed, as well as to entertain through television shows. It is where the promotion of products through advertisements is done. The media is also there to provide information regarding health, wealth and general well-being. All of this has resulted in multi-billion-dollar industries. Unheard of anywhere else. It is the job of journalist is to be abreast of what is going on in the nation, outside in the world and of course what legislations are being passed in government. The job of reporters is to inform regular people of what is going on since ordinary people are busy with their own jobs and do not have the time to listen to everything around them. That puts a heavy burden on journalists to be upstanding. They are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the general public to warn of danger. The newscasts who present daily news on current affairs are expected to have done thorough investigation to ensure that the stories are accurate. The sources must be credible, and interviews must allow for every side of the issue to be represented. Research is done with the goal of getting to the root of what is going on and observations must be as unbiased as possible. Life and death are definitely in the tongue of the newscasters. But now, journalists spend less time on the ground speaking to people to get to the facts and have now become opiniated. Even the weather forecasters are not seen as being credible. Reporters have become mouth pieces to push propaganda. They either glorify one-side or completely tear-down the other side and many times refuse to give all of the information. The subtleness is now full blown. Legacy media despise the Republican Party, they have disdain for Christians and absolutely hate patriots. They have been exposed as only covering anything democrat and making excuses for anything that democratic politicians do, even though that is not what the job of the media is supposed to be about. Words are very powerful. That is why editors and producers are there to validate the information before it is aired to the masses. In this election year, many candidates want to get their message out but Townhalls, press conferences and Rallies do not reflect what these candidates stand for and the people who want to vote for them. What is shown or presented shapes the attitudes of people and it is a disservice to this society to see what the main-stream media has become. In a day where social media is not as accessible to older people, and the elderly still depend on television, the media must be called out as being fake and for truly being the enemy of the people. But thankfully, there is alternative media that is filling the gap and people are using their faculties to decipher what is true from false. Sophia K. Worrell XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO February 14, 2024 BUILDING BACK BETTER On this freezing Valentine’s Day, we are winning. Although, last night we went down in defeat in the special election to fill a seat that the stupid Republicans gave up and we watched as 18 Republican senators signed unto a bill to send more money to countries that don’t give a shit about us here in the United States, we are winning. Even though there is an influx of illegal aliens invading our country, filling up our city shelters and burdening every service that they have never paid into, while they are beating up our police officers and giving us the middle finger, we are winning. It may seem as though we are being held hostage by policies that hurt us who are working and paying taxes. And we may be at the mercy of a government who is deliberately undoing every policy that is in place to ensure our safety and security, but we are winning. It may seem as though we cannot protect ourselves, our family, our fellowmen, our businesses or our city at this time, and that we are living through a nightmare, and we certainly are living through scary times.  But there is still hope and a way out. But you might ask “how are we winning?” We are winning because we are observing all of this blatant disregard for our civil liberties by politicians that refuse to adhere to their oath of office. We are realizing that the government of New York City is not interested in working on behalf of the residents and citizens, but their own interest. People all across America, and mainly in states or cities where there is democrat control are becoming aware that politicians who are democrats cannot run a state or city and use bullying tactics to hide their incompetence. We are the sleeping giant that they have awaken. We kept silent for fear of making life harder for ourselves, but now we have to take our lives back and our city as well. We have no choice but to push back against this madness, or we will not have a country or a city. It may seem as though the deck is stacked against us, and it is definitely stacked against us because these politicians are selected by entities outside of us; but we can do something about our situation. The problem is that these politicians pretended that they were solving social issues by coming up with programs to help the disenfranchised but were actually lining their pockets instead. Democrats have never built or created anything and have no idea how the economy works. They are filled with hubris and pretend that they are intelligent and that is why they have such a smug demeanor. It is because they think that we can never ever penetrate their fort. The good news is that they have been exposed! It is evident that our America society is on the verge of collapse. All of this occurred because we allowed the government to slowly encroach on our civil liberties and all the while the republicans who were supposed to be representing did nothing to impede them. But we cannot lay all the blame at these feckless politicians’ feet. We have to take some blame for what has happened to us. We can do this because the republicans are a reflection of who we used to be. Products of parents who have taught us to be submissive. Remnants of preachers who told us to turn the other cheek. Prodigies of teachers who did not properly prepare us for the world of work and politics. Now that we have analyzed the problem, we can arrive at a solution and now we get to work. We do this by accepting our part in permitting the government to have so much power and control over our lives. Next, we forgive ourselves for being distracted, busy with work, family, fun and freedom. We forget putting total trust in candidates who promised to represent us. By doing this, we can now fully participate in all elections and will vote every one of these politicians who have never had a real job out of office. From the resident of the White House to the senators, house of representative members, governor, mayor, attorney general, district attorney, city council members, school boards members and congressmen in our assembly, we must vote them all out and going forward vet the candidates who are seeking to replace them. Going forward we have to understand that private life and public life goes hand in hand. We must be engaged in every aspect of life that affects us. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. We may not have understood that it is the regulations and policies of politicians that impacted our daily lives, but now we do. Sunlight is definitely the best disinfectant. The light was shined and now we are awake.  We have locusts in our government at the federal, state and local level to exterminate. America is our home; if we don’t let the termites run us out of our homes, why are we running away from these locusts in government? Sophia K. Worrell ………………………………………………….

Worrell ########## February 17, 2024 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN & WOMEN If a child comes home and complain to his parents that he is being teased or bullied at school, what is the usual response of the parents. More often than nought, the mother would probably tell him to let the teacher know what is going on, but what would his father say or do?  More often than nought, the father would take his son outside and start training him for combat. Unfortunately, the second choice has been wiped away from our society. The ability for the so-victim to fight back has been eradicated from the picture under the guise of some flowery words. The following is an excerpt an individual who has a bachelor’s degree in law who has written an article about being bullied. The writer states, “ Being bullied is a frustrating and painful experience. When you are being bullied, it can often feel like things are out of your hands. While the onus is never on you to stop the bullying , and it’s never your fault, there are some things you can do to handle being bullied.” By Toketemu Ohwovoriole. There are two phrases in that excerpt that is troubling. The author did not seem to proofread her work and it calls into considering her contradictions in the passage. Her first suggestion: while the onus is never on you to stop the bullying, sets the child up for failure. It tells him that he is helpless and is at the mercy of his circumstances. On the next line, she reinforces this terrible suggestion: it is never your fault , this lays the blame completely on the other person. There is no way out for either the bully or the victim to resolve the situation. And despite making these statements, the writer goes on to list ways to handle the situation by recommending: Remove yourself from the situation. Try to talk to the bully. Talk to someone you trust. Stay confident. Enforce your boundaries. In one hand, she is telling the person being bullied that the onus is not on them to stop the bullying, and on the other hand, she is telling them to remove themselves from the situation. And what is even most ridiculous is to tell the person being bullied to talk to the bully. I am not sure if she understands how bullying works. And then she continues her expert advice to tell the victim of bullying to stay confident and enforce boundaries. If I am not mistaken, all of this sure sounds like the onus is on the victim to stop the bullying. The passage highlights what is wrong with females and schooling. The absence of mothers in the home is why people walk through water and never get wet. Mothers are no longer reading to their children in the home and there seems to be no evaluation of text in schools. Every student seems to be leaving school as an activist instead of a scholar. Mothers are in the workplace, instead of in the home and this is causing a crisis in society. The mother is the first teacher, and the father is the person who brings objectivity. A mother’s role is vital for many reasons. She starts the learning process in preparation for formal learning.  She sets the stage for the father to bring a balance to learning. But just as men have been emasculated, women have been beaten down as well and the child suffers with one-sided views that is divisive. Sophia K. Worrell +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ February 18, 2024 THE WONDERS OF FATHERHOOD & MOTHERHOOD The best advice that can be given to young people is to enjoy and envelop life because before starting a family. Females are wired to have children. Everything within females is driven by the thought of one day having a baby. The reproductive system which leads to the menstrual cycle is all in place for that miraculous occasion for a woman to become pregnant. The amazing technology of an ultrasound can give a preview of the life that is growing inside of a woman. Studies accurately correspond with the development of the baby. Parents will see that the stages of growth mirror the time frame laid out in books for organs to take shape. Bulges confirm life and movement. Fathers are not left out of the experience as the fetus respond to his stimuli. The swelling tummy reflects the growth that is taking place. Lamaze classes facilitate a smoother delivery, as it takes the focus off the pain because emphasis is placed on breathing. Young people have the freedom to serve their own interest before becoming parents, but that all changes when a baby comes into the picture. Holding that helpless baby changes everything. The responsibility for that new bundle of joy may seem overwhelming but doesn’t have to be that way. That is because as a young adult, you have been taking responsibility for your own life with lesser and lesser help from your parents and haven’t done such a bad job so far. Parents from both the father and mother are usually close by to lend any assistance. Their expertise should be seen as invaluable. Sophia K. Worrell %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% February 19, 2024 SELFISHNESS & NARCISM No man is an island. From antiquity to present day, people have always depended on the services of others in some form or fashion. It was the man who went out and hunted and brought the game home for the woman to cook. And what is constant is that children are dependent on their parents until they can take care of themselves. Everyone is dependent on someone to still plant the food, make the clothing, build the houses, and create modes of travel. Each of these require some kind of skill and training. However, there seem to be no training for the most important job in life and that is to be parents. The more advance societies become, the more selfish and narcissist people seem to be, as they are under the impression that they do not need anyone and that everything just pops up from nowhere. Parenting classes are needed because it will help young people understand why populating the earth is so essential to the sustenance of everyone. But why are young adults so nonchalant? Simply because parents have abdicated their jobs of exposing their children to service. There is a period of time when ‘it was all about you’ and another time when you can just focus on yourself, but the sequence in life requires the maturity to understand that you are needed. Producing a human being is the most consequential event there will ever be and that is not an inconvenience, it is something that must be thrived for in the process of continuing our civilization. Sophia K. Worrell ================================ February 20, 2024 LIFE OF SERVICE Our civilization has been wonderfully set up. There is nothing new under the sun. We in this modern society have the help of all kinds of resources to assist us with anything that we are undertaking. Life of service begins with us being obedient to our parents and respectful of others. Learning is an ongoing process and does not end when we graduate from high school, college or a trade. For example, a person who has been taught to drive and passes the driving test is not a driver just because they were given the license. They now have to put those lessons into practice when they are on the road alone, without an instructor sitting beside them. The way in which children behave and act has its start from the time they are born and are exposed to life outside of the mother. The way in which the mother attends to the needs of her child, sets them up or hinders them from forming proper relationships with others. In conjunction are communication skills that children will need in all areas of their lives. It begins with the mother reading to the young child, engaging in conversations, listening and having an exchange of ideas. It is further enhanced with the tiny tot having the freedom and flexibility to explore the world on the inside and outside with the father by their side as guide and moderator. Parents have to slowly let go of the reins and allow for more leverage as the child grows older for them to test out what they were told. As the young child expand their relationship beyond their parents, extended family and family acquaintances, they are being prepared for social interactions with people in the general public. This process of giving and receiving, speaking and listening, listening and testing, adhering and punishing is all preparation for their future interactions in other facets of their lives. This is all about them learning that they are to be served and that they must also serve in the chain of life. Sophia K. Worrell OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO February 21, 2024 THE DIGNITY OF WORK From the start of human creation, the first man Adam was assigned to work and that has not changed throughout the history of man’s existence. When God handed over the world he created to Adam and Eve, he could have handed them a finish product and let them just sit around all day. After the fall and their expulsion from the garden of Eden, the man still had to go out and work, while the woman was tasked with childbirth and the caring of her young. The lines were clearly defined. But overtime, men were attacked as being toxic and women were taunted for staying home and raising children. The work of men undermined the work of women. Comparisons were made between the man who was making a salary and the woman who was at home cooking, cleaning and caring for children. The discontent between husband and wife, father and mother led to kids who were overburdened with chores and who became pesky kids. Later, day care centers, nannies and public schooling became the guardians as men and women competed for salaries and wages. The health and wellbeing of children suffered along with the parents and inevitably the damage was done. Without proper supervision, children languish. Students are illiterate because no one is there to take interest in them completing homework assignments. The television is their babysitter. The cellphone is their playmate. Children are angry because they had to deal with their father being away so often and now, they have to cope with the absence of their mother as well. They have been left to their devices without a proper grasp of what they are getting themselves into. The anger of feeling neglected closes them off from sharing with their parents who are always bickering because the woman is overwhelmed, and the man is still going on as usual. The dignity of work begins with individuals ready to revive the people and people willing to embrace the work needed to fix this scourge. Sophia K. Worrell +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ February 22, 2024 THE AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA Our Founding Fathers declared independence from Britain and created a Constitutional Republic to put the power in the hands of the people to govern themselves, instead of being ruled by a king.  It was the Republican Party that continued that tradition, while the democratic party gained a strangle hold on some groups of people by offering welfare and the promise of healthcare and housing. After seizing a block of the population, to maintain the power grab, democrat politicians proceeded to divide Americans by pitting Chistian’s against atheist, rich against poor, blacks against whites, working class against those who are on welfare programs and heterosexuals against homosexuals. The Republican party’s mission is for less government, but the mission of the democrat party is to accumulate voters by offering handouts and free stuff. The amass of power has led the democrats to claw, bully, threaten, intimidate, pressure, terrorize and force heads of departments to give in to their Marxist, socialist and communists demands. When apposed, they use name-calling, censorship, cancelling, pandering, slogans, the abuse of language & messaging, and fear-tactics to silence viewpoints. Donald J. Trump has emerged as the leader of the Republican Party with the “America First” message. There was a shockwave when he became President in 2016, and in addition to all of his accomplishments was the exposure of the slow crawl to communism and socialism was underway. This has led to many people running for public office and parallel economies being set up along with alternative media to counteract the narratives. And now that the playbook of the democrats has been uncovered and exposed, it has led to them stepping on rakes and the overreach is backfiring. Sophia K. Worrell &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& February 23, 2024 THE INFORMATION WAR I have stated before that wars have been fought for territory and for power. At that time, the world was made up of European territories that were jockeying for position as world leaders. The dominant race was white people who operated on an advance, sophisticated level. In other territories, people were content to stay in the confines of their territory. The only movement was them roaming from one area to another to find food and fighting against each other for survival. The discovery of America by Europeans continued the war for additional land. It was the Pilgrims and Puritans who first landed on these shores to escape continuous persecution so as to get a new start to freely practice their religion. The worship God is the foundation on which North America was established. Battles were not foreign to Europeans. Combating enemy forces was in their bloodstream. There have been over 400 battles fought by North Americans and one of the first was the Battle of Lexington and Concord. The American Revolution started with American soldiers going against the British soldiers and thankfully only about 90 soldiers were killed. After the Constitution was written, a Civil War was fought to end slavery. That battle started outside of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania between the Confederate Army of the South, which was led by General Robert E. Lee and the Union Army of the North, which was led by General George Meade which led to a total of 46,000 casualties. President Lincoln gave a two-minute speech famously known as the Gettysburg Address later that year at the Soldier’s National Cemetery in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. A famous battle was the Invasion of Normandy, also known as “D-Day” where American Troops allied with Britain, Canada, and France to attack German forces which gave them victory that had a huge impact on the Second World War in Europe. The Allied Forces were led by Dwight D. Eisenhower of the US whereas the Germans were led by Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt. We are asked not to forget the Battle of the Alamo which was a pivotal event and military engagement in the Texas Revolution. It was fought between rebellious Texans and the Mexican army from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The Alamo was a fortified old mission in the center of the town of San Antonio de Béxar, defended by about 200 rebellious Texans, including Lt. Colonel William Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo Mission, killing most of the occupants. The first immigrants who came to the colonies, brought their study habits and educational prowess, their work ethic, their ingenuity and their love for progress. Freedom is the main tenant of the United States of America. There has been a lot of sacrifice to make North America into what it is today. There are a lot of men who have shed their blood all across this land and the world and whose bodies lay in the Arlington National Cemetery is the country’s largest military cemetery and serves as the final resting place for more than 400,000 military veterans and their immediate family from the fronts of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as World Wars I and II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, the Cold War and America’s Civil War. These are the events that has led to respect for national sovereignty and the flag is a symbol and reminder of the soldiers that sacrificed their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. Veterans are now revered for their service and yet, the history of this country is not being taught as it should. We are presently in an information war where everything has been turned on its head. Every institution has been infiltrated and watered down to meaninglessness. The question is being asked: “will this experiment of 240 years survive?”. It is time for a national revival. Sophia K. Worrell ————————————————————— February 24, 2024 LEADERSHIP There is a difference between being the leader and being a leader . The Leader is the one who is on top of any organization. The success of any business is the man at top. The man who starts a business has an idea that he wants to execute and as he brings people on, it is crucial that he conveys that idea clearly to his staff through words, actions or example. For instance, if his idea is to make widgets, he must have personnel who does his accounts, who does the marketing and advertisement, and he must have someone who oversees the legal aspect. Additionally, he has to have people who make the widgets and packages them for delivery and people who sells the products. He empowers his team by giving support, provided tools, and extra training for them to meet the goals of the company. He fosters growth and development by clarity which helps everyone understand their role and contributes to overall success. Leadership isn’t limited to formal titles; from the boardroom to the boiler room, people who embody the qualities of not just seeing the business as being owned by the person who founded the company, but a way in which they are able to run their personal business is a paradigm shift in thinking and working. A leader understands the concept of leadership in another way. They may not be in charge of starting the business or running the company, but they are the leader of their own lives. As the leader of their household which is dependent on the finances that comes from the work they do, then they must step up as a leader to ensure that continuous employment is maintained. This is done by adhering to the terms of the employment contract of employment. That would involve showing up to work on time and on the days agreed upon. It also involves understanding what their duties are and making sure that their assignments are turned in on time and with efficiency. The success of any country is also the man on the top who is the president. He must follow the laws of the land and in the case of America, that is the Constitution. The President of the United States (POTUS) holds a crucial role in the U.S. government. His duties involve reviewing Federal Laws (Bills). Congress consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives who makes legislation that he is either approve or vetoes. If he approves of the bill, it begins law. His main role in leading the nation is to ensure that citizens obey the laws that sets priorities for the country. He also works with Congress to decide how the budget is spent, addressing issues such as education, healthcare, defense, and infrastructure. The president serves as the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. He makes crucial decisions related to national security, military operations, and defense strategy. The president negotiates treaties with foreign governments with the help of the Senate who must ratify these treaties. They combined efforts plays a crucial role in shaping international relations. The president appoints members of the executive branch, including cabinet members, ambassadors, and agency heads. These High-Ranking Officials impact the functioning of various government agencies. Of his most monumental duties is to nominate federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. Senate confirmation is required for these appointments. The president represents the United States on the global stage, engaging in diplomacy, attending international summits, and addressing global challenges to representing the Nation. During emergencies, natural disasters, or crises, the president provides leadership and coordinates responses for Crisis Management. Some of his other entertaining and symbolic duties is to host state dinners, meets with foreign dignitaries, and participates in ceremonial events. Citizens may not be the leader of a country, but they are a leader of their own lives. They must be educated to what it means to be a productive citizen, a proper spouse, a good parent, a studious student, an ethical worker and most of all, an informed citizen of their political rights and responsibilities. As a leader, it is crucial that citizens hold their elected officials accountable, and that they understand what policies are in place and how it helps or hurts them. As a leader, they can run for office or assist a campaign as they are aware that politics impact them whether they are engaged or not. This is what being a holistic person is all about. Sophia K. Worrell ############################## February 25, 2024 NEW YORK, NEW YORK Growing up on a small island is extremely different from living in a big city.  The landmass itself contributes to any world view. Apart from the weather, which remains relatively the same, the way in which houses and buildings are constructed and the modes of transportation will vary. The lifestyle on an island is usually more of a laid-back atmosphere and the employment opportunities tend to be limited and more traditional as there is not a great demand for certain types of vocations. On the other hand, the pace in a big city is usually faster which lends itself to have pop-up shops and stores. New York City has gone through many changes and yet is still the epicenter of America. It is still known for its port of entry for immigrants and welcomes tourist from all over the world to enjoy its arts and culture. However, mismanagement has led to the rise of crime and violence and the tearing down of monuments that is supposed to serve as a reminder of what this nation was built on. Like many cities, New York has a long-standing tradition of being the city that never sleeps. But unfortunately, we have a group of politicians that are sleepwalking us off a cliff. Sophia K. Worrell OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO February 26, 2024 CLASS WARFARE It is the job of older folks to pass on their wisdom and experience to younger people. Older women must embrace younger women and older men must embrace younger men and share how they have overcome obstacles. Young people must be open to these stories and comprehend that although life seems different, everything is still the same. For instance, women have always worked and contributed in some way to society. It is not necessary to fight for the right for women to work and to compete with men. Black people have always worked in America and there is no reason to fight for their right to work and contribute to this nation. Immigrants have always worked in America and have always contributed in some way to the development of this nation and pathways to citizenship have been rigorous to ensure the stamina of people seeking to live and work. There are particular jobs that women can do and certain jobs that only a man can do. Women’s psyche is formed in a particular way that draws her to specific vocations and men are built to carry out fixed jobs. As an example, men are sent to war. Embedded in them is the ability to fight and defend. This is not the case with women. They are wired to care. European people are geared towards risks and adventure. People from third-world countries are more low-keyed. Some people go out there and start businesses. Others may not want the headache and would invest in the business. While many would prefer to just work and not have all the responsibility it takes to run the business. In school, there are always three types of children. Those students who are scholars and academically inclined. Then there are students who are not so bright. And right in the middle are students who are of average intelligence. In every society, there are the super-rich, the very poor and the middle class. These groups balance each other. There are only two genders: a male and female. They are supposed to balance out each other as well. Social stratification is intact. However, economic stability is volatile and must be attended to because the height to which the population can reach has not been truly addressed. Sophia K. Worrell @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ February 27, 2024 THE BROKEN LEGS THEORY Turning the Corner. If we as parents are not satisfied with what our children are doing, or not doing for that matter when they have become adults, we have to look internally and question where we went wrong. The same can be said for our nation at large. Today our society is a mess. Our representatives are either wayward or weak. Where does the blame lie? Citizens bear some responsibility for an out-of-control government. Just as training and discipline is required in the home to keep children in check and reinforcement of values and ethics is expected in the private sector to keep employers and employees in check, there must be policies to reign in public servants. Without laws and the reinforcement of those laws, society falls into chaos. The Broken Legs Theory has been playing out behind the scenes for many years but is now being enacted in plain sight. The concept of ‘broken legs’ is as follows. Break up black families and then ask for public assistance programs and welfare and expand cities into a Nanny State. Break the border and demand reform and money to fix the problem. Open pipelines and give money to countries that are up-to-no-good and then demand more money to resolve the conflict. Stop all drilling and lie that it is about saving the environment which impacts the making of products and the delivery of goods. Push for babies to be killed under the guise of my body my choice, while mandating people to take an experimental vaccine. All the while using name-calling tactics, shutting down any discussion and fearmongering to force people into compliance. Lack of courage. And while all of this is taking place, people are constantly surprised at the weakness of those who without fail do not push back in any significant way. The weakness of those who are supposed to be an opposition and the fear of the general public is reflected in the lack of response on either side.  When speaking up has become dangerous, fighting back can be deadly and disagreement comes with a cost, who can blame themselves or their representatives. Parents are supposed to help their children do courageous things. They are there to encourage bravery. But statistics do matter, and it takes one man to get up and dance for others to follow. And now many citizens of this country are coming to the realization that no one is coming to save them and even if the calvary did come, they still had to get in the battle. And so, for those who are objectively observing all of this, solidarity with those who have created this great nation and died to preserve it has never been so apparent. There is no difference between parents who thought that life was all about them, until they held their spawn in their hands and people who are recognizing that they have to take a stance to stop the collapse of this country. There is now no separation between those men who willingly signed up as troops and went to war and the women who had to pick up the slack and courageously balanced raising children and filling the gaps that men left and people who have to stand. In Philadelphia, during the summer of 1787, when the men emerged after four months of deliberation throughout the convention of states and a lady famously asked, “Well Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” To which Franklin replied tartly, “A republic, if you can keep it”. It serves as a reminder that the preservation of our democratic institutions rests not only on their establishment but also on the vigilance and commitment of the citizens who uphold them. The time has passed to fret about who was or is failing us and why they have sold out this country. Many parts of this country have been falling for a long time and only now like dominoes, the affect is being felt all over. There has been a clash of civilizations in the United States of America for a long time. Majority white European people against minority races. The chasm between a mind that gravitates towards development and an inferiority complex of existence. The ideals of first-world people versus the ideology of third-world people. The expanse of wealth and prosperity as others wallowed in abject poverty. And a middle class that sought to hold everything together as representative of the bourgeoisie. And just as in the times of war color, creed, race and class no longer matters. We all have our part to play, whether great or small. Sophia K. Worrell XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX February 28, 2024 MONEY/FINANCES/BUDGETING Many economists complain that the general population do not understand how to manage their earnings. Many people have high credit card debt, do not know how to budget their earnings and do not have a solid financial nest egg. Critics say it is the fault of the school and others point to parents who seem to be at a loss of how to properly prepare the kids for the future. In such a powerful country as the United States of America, it is inexcusable that so many young people leave school without a clue of what they want to do with their lives. It is a disgrace that these same young people are not taking advantage of the multitude of opportunities that are available. Somewhere, somehow, we as older folk have dropped the ball. At a time when we as individuals do not have to worry about dinosaurs or the hazards of brutal climates because we have managed to invent modern conveniences, people are just as lost as ever. Someone or some ones closed the public square and discussion which is paramount to people have been rebutted. The marketplace of ideas has been halted.  The building blocks of society has been suspended and inventing and innovating has been discouraged. For some reason, opinions have been censored, relevant information has been cancelled and now certain topics are off the table. People are too sensitive to hear criticism and standards must be lower for other groups of people. This insanity must be stopped, and thoughts and ideas allowed to flow so as to counteract the insanity that is hanging over us and crushing our will to live. We must welcome the knowledge of older folks. The feedback is paramount to our survival as a species. Now, no subject is off the table going forward. Sophia K. Worrell ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… February 29, 2024 NO MORE APOLOGIES Christians were taught that this world is not their home and that they were just passing through. And so, many believers in God, fell for the preaching of ministers and settled in a job waiting for the skies to open and Jesus to come and take them to heaven. Year in and year out every generation was told that they were in the world but not of the world and not to store up treasures on earth. These ministers rejected wealth-building and many lowly people struggled to amount any substantial capital. And if any of them needed money, they were told to pray to the Lord for a job and that was the answer to all their troubles. But non-believers or atheists were not buying into this malarkey.  They understood that trade was an important part of life and invested in stocks and assets. They took over the world that Christians abandoned and became the owners of property, businesses and large corporations and the consequence was that Christians became the hired help and renters. Education and degrees were so heavily criticized by preachers that Christians felt guilty for going into any field that yielded gains. This was not the case with nonspiritual people. They leaned into every diploma, certification and degree and became the teachers, professors and tutors and started pushing their view of life to children who were vulnerable. They became lawyers and judges and government officials and formed a coalition and overtime; Christians were shut out of every institution. But finally, Christians have come to the realization that they do live on this earth and that while passing through, they still need to take care of themselves and those around them. They are now aware that if they truly believe in God, then as his children, this earth belongs to them in this life and the life to come. The emphasis on just getting through each day has now been completely turned on its head. By waking up from the stupor they were put in, they realize that they have a lot of ground to make up because they had fallen for the obfuscation of truth. But is it too late? Emphatically, no! As long as there is life on earth, it is never too late. The truth is that Christians have to be vigilant going forward. While preparing for a new earth, they still have to take care of what has been given to them by their heavenly father. This awakening has led Christians to admit that the predicament they find themselves in is because they had dropped the ball to an insatiable group of people. This has ultimately led to a nation in crisis. The nation in crisis is actually the destruction of lives which in turn leads to a lot of mess on many fronts. The mess requires a clean-up crew to do major house-cleaning and there is unfortunately, a lot of cleaning up on aisle America. Regrettably, not having built up enough funding for this enormous project, Christians have to rely on the God of the Universe to sponsor this massive clean-up program. The initial bartering exchange has evolved to trading with money which inadvertently has resulted in purchasing power being done with cash or cards.  So, in order to attain the tools and equipment to clean up any mess it will require the backing of the Master of all the riches on this globe. Christians have to morph into cleaners so as to come to grips with the reality that finances are where the power lies, and control of the purse strings is how major problems are fixed. It takes tools and equipment to clean up the mess that has been made which can only be brought with money. As cleaners are solicited, additional money will be required to maintain the cleaning process. In order to keep and grow the movement of cleaners, funds must be attained to cultivate and train them in the work that has to be done. Qualified cleaners then have to be dispersed into the private sector and rise to the ranks of CEO and while that is happening, cleaners have to also get elected in the public sector and rise to the ranks of governor and mayor. Cleaners have to end government programs that take away the dignity of people and cleaners must restructure school systems to build the resources of minds in a tangible way. Cleaners have to become the new media and be tasked with reporting the news with honesty and integrity. Cleaners have to be brave in speech and action and most of all, be explicit with their children so as to not have weak, uninformed, low-information prodigies. Weakness and ignorance have ushered in a phase of madness and degeneration. Strength and knowledge will clean up the mess and steer everyone back into the essence of civility, high standards and accountability. We are in the last quarter of this game. Without further defense of values and apology for principles, Christians/Cleaners can come from behind and bring home a win. Remember, that in Christ we already have the victory. Sophia K. Worrell ======================================= February 1, 2024 APPRECIATING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY The United States of America has become a beacon of hope for every country in the world but now that it is on the brink of its own collapse, not one single country is coming to its rescue! It is undeniable, that Americans are the most accommodating and generous people in all of the world. They have been raised to help those who are less fortunate than themselves. But how has that generosity been repaid? In a country where not only, horizontal mobility is available, but upward mobility can be achieved with hard work and preservation, no matter the background of the individual, the American way of life has been bashed and the people that made it all possible, is browbeaten. Americans are accused of being plunders and racist and yet many people are breaking into this country to enjoy the wealth and prosperity that they have not contributed towards. It is stated that the American society was built on immigration. Yet, no one stops to analyze what conditions the first immigrants met and that maybe, just maybe, they came and found a barren land and had to start from scratch to build a civilization that we all take for granted right now. By Sophia K. Worrell ************************************************************* February 2, 2024 THE POPULATION & ETHOS OF AMERICA The United States of America is a Constitutional Republic which has a system of ‘consent by the governed’ made up of a majority of white European people and a minority of other groups consisting of Asian, Spanish, Indian and black people. White Americans constitutes the majority of the people in the United States. According to the 2020 census, 71%, or 235,411,507 people, were a combination, or 61.6%, or 204,277,273 people, were White alone. The U.S. Hispanic population reached 62.1 million in 2020, an increase of 23% over the previous decade. The Black population of the United States is stagnant. In 2022, there were an estimated 47.9 million people who self-identified as black American-born, making up 11.4% of the country’s population. As of 2016, about 13 million — about 4% of the total U.S. population — have Caribbean ancestry, consisting of people of Indian descent and black persons. In 2020, the Asian population reported approximately 19.9 million or 7.2% of the total population. The ethos of white European is about taking risks. This has allowed them to create institutions that elevated them above all other ethnic groups. The ability to do research in all kinds of conditions and climates, to explore seas and lands in order to present the data needed to build institutions, has elevated white people over other ethnic groups of people. The concerted effort to tear down instead of add value is regulated to a tiny sub-sect of people who are afraid to take the chance to be pioneers. This is not the case with white men who had a vision of a life beyond being nomads, living in tents, huts, pulling water from wells and wearing animals’ skins. It was the Dutch, then the French, next Spain and finally Britain which took the risk to explore the world and have established a civilization that is second-to-none in these great United States of America. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 3, 2024 THE GENRES OF WORK IN AMERICA We are placed on this earth to work. The Apostle Paul stated, “If a man does not work, he should not eat.” But in a country with great wealth and prosperity, many people seem comfortable to live on welfare programs, public assistance and entitlement benefits and yet, complain about the people who have opened work opportunities in all kinds of genres. In many countries, there are what is generally known as traditional jobs. Sports and entertainment are a pastime and is limited to a singing career at best. In the United States, a person has the opportunity to make a lucrative career in unconventional work in the arts and sports. If a person can think of a need and fill it, they can build a business that will bring them great success and prosperity. There is no limitation on the imagination. This freedom of market system has allowed capitalism to pull many people out of poverty. But where did this mindset originate from? Was it Africans who developed and supported the efforts of people who had the idea to invent, innovate and produce products and services of every kind? Was it Latinos who decided that an individual could excel in acting, playing a game, writing a book or painting a picture? Was it Asians who encourage their fellowman to start a small business and then grow it into a corporation, or to go a step further and expand that model in several different locations or to take it to the next level of building franchises? Was it West Indians who came up with the means of transacting so as to mitigate fair dealings between the owner and customer, the owner and the supplier and the owner and the bank. The ability to risk delving into every category of work and deliberating a cost that meets the skill is to be credited to white European men. Love them or hate them, no other third world country can boast of what this first-world nation of America has perfected. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 4, 2024 MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD We are wonderfully made. The scripture verse in Psalm 139:14 reads: “I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful; I know that full well.”  In a fallen world, there will be people who understand the importance of taking care of this world and their bodies and others will not pay as much attention. However, this verse is a reminder that we are all unique and special in our own way. It is a testament to the beauty of God’s creation and the importance of self-love and the ability to love the people and things that are around us. For example, many people appreciate the falling of the snow and the rain showers. They know that the rain and sun fulfil a purpose. These elements are not there to disrupt our day, but to help the foliage, the animals, birds and human beings as a whole. As children, we enjoyed the rain drops on the roof and the snow falling on the ground. They were extensions of play. Somehow as adults, they have become impediments to getting from one place to another. The indifference to the world around us, has seemingly been carried over to the care of our bodies. The lack of exercise, attention to diet and proper grooming habits is leading to health issues where pharmaceuticals and medication is taking the place of proper rest and appreciation for what our body-machinery. Instead of preventing health issues, there is more of an after-thought towards maintenance as work and day to day activities are the excuse for why the body is breaking down. Is it possible to return to being like little children, even as adults. Is it possible, to stop and smell the roses? Yes, if we make a conscious effort to do so. When I lived in the Caribbean, the beach was a minute walk away, the sun, moon and stars were visible each day. I took it for granted. I have to intentionally look up to see the moon. Now that I am in this big city, I have to commute to go to the beach. I am learning to find the tradeoffs in this city. Like a child, I am forced to be curious about my surroundings again and to enjoy new ways of amusing myself. And I am finding that it is not as hard to take care of myself, and to find pleasure in the earth I live on. How about you? By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 5, 2024 RECLAIMING LANGUAGE Language is very important to any society. It is how people communicate information, discuss problems, debate ideas and gather data. There are verbal and non-verbal cues. The use of words, structured in a particular way is how we engage in conversation with others. In English, we use the letters of the alphabet to construct words, string sentences together and create paragraphs. Words are used to define people, places and things. We call the name of a person or an object a noun . We explain an action with a verb . We combine two phrases with a conjunction . We provide more information about a noun with an adjective and we describe a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or even a whole sentence by using an adverb . There are many words where the meaning has to be looked up in a dictionary. Non-verbal cues can sometimes be easily interpreted, as with a smile, the wagging tail of a dog or a stern look. These agreed upon verbal and non-verbal cues have been accepted for centuries. It is what makes for a civil society. Navigating life on a daily basis can be challenging and so it is important for some things to remain constant. A growing child, a teenager and an adult come into many different systems each day and every one of them have their own organizational structure. Courtesies like good morning, goodbye and thank you are stables in a functioning society. The way we function at home, operate in school and navigate at work, calls for the individuals to be respectful of their parents & family, teachers & peers, employers & coworkers. Paying attention to time, space and roles in each of these areas elicit behaviors that convey respect that will be given back. The rules of engagement have been very clearly defined and acceptable until a few short years ago. Now every norm, and proper use of language and cues are seemingly being incrementally dismantled where there are no rules and people are offended if speech or actions are not politically correct. The people who are most offended, have never explained in any tangible way what the term of engagement are, and yet everyone is forced to comply without push back or be cancelled forever. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 6, 2024 THE FORCES OF GOOD & EVIL There are two forces in this life—the force of good and the force of evil. Christians have an explanation for why things go wrong and offer God as the Creator to realign our lives. Just as we go to history books to learn about prominent figures, “believers in Jesus Christ” point to the Bible to understand how this world came into being.  After creating the world, God created the first man called Adam and the first woman called Eve. Before God rested from all of his work, he looked at all he created, and called it good. We have a starting point for how evil was unleashed as well. Continuing in the scriptures, we read of the angel Lucifer seeking to exalt himself against the God who created him because he was envious of the Trinity and his position as the angel of music. Since then, human beings have been entangled between the battle of good and evil. God was upfront with Adam and Eve. His instructions were very simple and spoken with love. Here is the world I created for you to enjoy, partake of every fruit, except the tree of knowledge of good and evil , name the animals and I will meet with you in the cool of the day. The man and the woman lived with the animals and there was no fear for their safety. They were naked and had no awareness, just as the animals had no covering for their naked bodies. However, when the devil (who was once Lucifer), came to Eve, he hid his intentions. He hid in the body of a serpent. He obfuscated the truth. He preyed on the woman’s curiosity. What was the reason for the devil disguising himself and not revealing his scheme? The devil has severed ties with God and there is no restoration for him. His intention is to bring everyone down with him as he did the other angels. So how do we measure good and evil? Both of these actions are concepts. They can be judged by the body’s response to either one. The emotion that stems from doing good is a feeling that denotes well-being. The emotion that comes from bad is the opposite feeling of distress. Relief and pain are opposing factors. Good is outright, it shares, it explains, it brings evidence, it answers questions, it invites criticism and suggestions, it pivots if needed and it grows. Bad hides, it lies, it deflects, it shames, it has no answer or explanation, it doubles down, it is hard to change, it shrivels up and dies. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 7, 2024 INSTITUTIONS MADE AMERICA GREAT There are eight things that makes countries weak: (1) Having A Small Armed Force, (2) Being A Geographically Small Country, (3) Having A Small Population, (4) Having A Weak Government, (5) A Small Economy, (6) Having Bad Infrastructure, (7) Having A Divided Population and (8) Bad Geography Location. On the other hand, the opposite is true for strong countries with a large landmass, have large population, is strategically situated, resulting in a better economy. The difference between what constitutes as a weak country and why another is strong is the establishing of institutions.  An Institution is a society or organization founded for religious, educational, social, or business purposes. It can be an established official organization having a vital role in the life of a country, such as a bank, church, legislature or it can be an established law, practice, or custom. Institutions are also the formal rules that organize social, political, and economic relations which include the written laws, regulations, legal agreements and contracts which constitutes what is enforced by third parties, while informal institutions are the usually unwritten norms, procedures, conventions, and traditions that are often embedded in culture. These practices are implicit and drive incentives, norms and behaviors. They determine economic, legal, political, and social rights and opportunities. For nations to prosper, economic and political institutions must work hand in hand to benefit the citizens who participate in the moving of products and delivery of services. When even the common man can have skin in the game, virtuous cycles can be established. Institutions determine the guidelines and requirements for products and services. There is a criterion that is put in place which measures productivity and industry standards. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 8, 2024 THE VALUE OF WORK A simple google search breaks down a society as a group of individuals engaged in persistent social interaction or a large social group that shares the same spatial or social territory. The inhabitants consist of people who live close together and interact with one another. These individuals form the building blocks of social structures. The culture encompasses the shared beliefs, customs, traditions, language, art, and values within a society. It shapes how people perceive the world, how they interact with each other, and express themselves. In every society, there must be material products, such as tools, technology, architecture, clothing, and art. These artifacts reflect the collective creativity and practical needs of the community. And of course, social institutions are established in the form of family, education, religion, government, and the economy. Social institutions provide stability and guidelines for behavior. All of these social organizations refer to the patterns of relationships and roles within a society within a hierarchy of family structures, social classes, and a division of labor. These arrangements help maintain order and functionality through law enforcement. Adjustment to these structures have to be taught. The home is the first informal learning institution in which parents teach, guide and assist their growing child to understand what is expected of them. The different levels of schooling from kindergarten to high school and later unto higher education or trade schools is where formal learning takes place with the help of teachers, tutors, professors and principals. In order for a society to meet the needs of its populace, people must become skilled in a multitude of jobs. The day-to-day operational tasks has to be taught by breaking down what is expected through physical and mental labor, in order to maintain the means of production when workers change careers, get sick, retire, get injured or pass away. The problem is that individuals are not well-informed on how to manage their personal lives and their own finances. There is a disconnect between the value that individuals add to their civilization and the effect on the economy which is the lifeblood of every society. For instance, there was a time when parents taught children the value of work and earning money. The process must be restored. The little child was given an allowance to spend on trifles. Then they were given an allowance for doing chores. Later, as teenagers, parents allowed them to run errands for family members or help out their neighbors for a small fee. By the time they were adolescents, the father would hire them in his own business or encourage them to do afterschool jobs and summer work if he was himself, employed. Young people graduated to volunteering with non-profits, taking on apprenticeship work or internships long before their thought about entering college or going to a trade school or academy. Young men learned the value of work, by observing their father go off to work.  Young ladies learned the value of taking care of the home by watching their mother maintain the house. They gained the necessary experience by working inside and outside of the home. They received the foundational skills to budget, spend wisely, save and invest their earnings. And most of all, they obtained people skills by the various customer service skills they engaged in. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 9, 2024 FEMINISM AND THE DOWNFALL OF SOCIETY The feminist movement pontificated that “It is a man’s world” and hollered that most corporate jobs, (and for some reason, not the dirty, hard jobs), were male dominated and women were not getting equal pay for equal work. Along with attacks on men were the shaming of women who wanted to stay at home to take care of their husbands and children. Of course, it did not matter that females are child-bearers, and the miracle of birth is still the most fascinating thing in life. These feminists totally ignored the fact that the only way people come into this world is by a man inseminating a woman where she becomes pregnant with a little human being.  Feminists seem to miss the tiny fact that men still faithfully go out and work and someone has to stay home with the baby. And of course, it does not matter that the females who buy into their rhetoric has become more disgruntled over the years as they ignore their instincts and longings. The rantings of feminists are very incoherent. The date has not and cannot be substantiated by them. That is simply because they have an agenda to break up what God has designed—that is; the man to be the protector and the provider and the woman to be the homemaker and the nurturer. A child born into a home with a father and a mother is the backbone of every society. From time past and into eternity, females have an innate yearn to have babies. And that yearning makes it impossible to fully compete with men. The only way to do so is to give up that desire to have a child in pursuit of a career and that usually leaves a hole in a woman’s heart and soul, (I have heard it said way too many times by women who don’t have children). Feminists pretend that women are all alone in this process and accuse all men as being creeps. They take isolated cases and lump them together as a way to push their agenda. There is never any discussion to hold women accountable for their actions, but always to blame men although in many cases, women are consenting partners. In proper relationships, planning is done where both spouses discuss the point where children will enter the relationship. When done right, the women will not be left to bear the responsibility of raising the child alone. In this planning process, she has a period of time to join the workforce before becoming getting married and later becoming pregnant. There are already provisions in the work environment for women to take time off to deliver her baby and then take additional time to care for the helpless newborn. It is understood that mothers with little children may have a challenge when asked to do overtime and bosses are sensitive to their dilemma. Once articulated to the employer, women are given grace to take youngsters to school and pick them up, as everyone is aware of the need for underaged children to be supervised. It is the law. Promotions may not be in the cards for her at that time if she cannot stay late or come in on short notice, if she confidently explains that she would have to scramble for a sitter. It is for this reason, that most women apply for jobs that would parallel the time that children are in school so that they could be available to meet the child’s needs. These feminists know all of this but chose to turn a blind-eye to all the reasons why most jobs are male-dominated. The simple fact is that men accept that they have go out to work unlike women who complain about their lot in life. Feminists ignore the fact that unlike men who are ridiculed if they are not providers, women have options. She can fully choose the option of staying home with the children when she gets married. She can work parttime as the children get older, while her husband provides the finances for the home. And she can return to fulltime employment when the children are grown and compliment his earnings if they both see the need. She can even start a small business while at home. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman being in the home and taking care of her family. But the rhetoric has worked and now there is a fractured society. Now we are living in a “woman’s world” where chaos and high emotions drive norms. Is it working? I think not. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 10, 2024 CIVIL LIBERTIES & CIVIL RIGHTS There are generally two sides of every issue. However, the ability to look at subjects from every angle seems nonexistent. The situations in this country that was a subject of contention and thought resolved has come back to the front again and every topic is deemed as highly sensitive and untouchable by some groups of people.  Slavery is one of these nagging issues that people cannot let go of and discrimination against black people and women, (especially by white men), has now risen to a point where they must be excommunicated from society and sent to the annals of hell.  Any opposing view to the contrary is met with victual and endless seething. Slavery had existed since antiquity and flourished in many parts of the world. Some slaves were captured in war or by piracy. The Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptians, Africans were sold by other Africans, in western Asia, parents sold their children out of poverty into servitude and many in the Balkans became slaves when their land was devasted by Ottoman invasions. Slaves could be Greek, Slav, European, African or Turkish. Many served as domestics, others sweated as galley slaves and many others worked on plantations. This is not just a black problem. There was segregation in the United States and in 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed. This landmark civil rights and labor law in the United States outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. With passage of a new Reconstruction Act in March 1867, the era of Radical, or Congressional, Reconstruction, began. Over the next decade, Black Americans voted in huge numbers across the South, electing a total of 22 Black men to serve in the U.S. Congress and two in the Senate. The feminist movement was and is a social and political campaign for radical and liberal reforms on so-called women’s issues on the pretense of inequality between men and women. The broad-brush paints reproductive rights, domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women’s suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence as issues affecting women. In the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides certain employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, while paid maternity leave is typically provided voluntarily by employers. Nationally, in 1920 with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, women were given the right to vote. The Holocaust was the genocide of European Jews during World War II. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population. The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Chełmno in occupied Poland. And yet, Jewish people have emerged as the most stable community all across the world. The patriarchy is blamed for all or most of the problems in the world. But who is the patriarchy? The definition of patriarchy is a social system in which positions of dominance and privilege are held by men. But what about the men who went to war and died or lost their limbs, or the men who dug the tunnels for the railroads, or the men who risk their lives to understand how the world around them worked, or the men who spend countless hours on the road in trucking to deliver products, or the men who patrol the streets and put their lives on the line to protect regular citizens, or the men who rush into burning buildings, or the men who risk their finances to build a business, or the men who study for years to be specialist in medicine, or the men who spend countless hours to fly people all over the world, or men who transport people all across the state and country, or the men who are out on ships to protect the homeland, or the men who work the trades that are not so glamorous to ensure that the lights stay on, the phone service is constant and that the water supply never dries up, or the men who walk for miles to ensure that there are no train derailments? Where is the dominance and privilege when the ship is sinking, and the patriarchy has to stand back as the women and children are the ones who go into lifeboats first? And where is it now, after men of kinds and stripes has used their minds and bodies to give us the best civilization in the world? It is time that the matriarchy appreciates what the patriarchy has done and focus on what our job is all about. Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 11, 2024 THE PRIVATE SECTOR/PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE U.S. In the United States of America, there is the private sector and the public sector. The private sector encompasses businesses and enterprises that are privately owned and operated for profit, managed by individuals and in some cases, answers to members of boards and shareholders. Whereas the public sector is the part of the economy that the government operates, funded through the taxes of its citizens. It was set up to provide public goods and services, such as national defense, law enforcement, public education, and infrastructure development. The funds collected by taxes are then allocated to various government budgets. In America, the government is funded by and answers to we the people . Every working person goes to a job and is either the employer or the employee. Even the individual who works for himself, answers to his customers. There are steps to starting any business. The basic components comprise of identifying a business idea, conducting market research, writing a business plan, choosing both a business structure and a location.  The operator of a business adheres to the rules and regulations for hiring and firing of staff, serving clients and customers and engaging with vendors. Those seeking employment go through the hiring process of submitting a resume and scheduling an interview. They bring experience and a willingness to add value to the company they desire to work in. It is the means of production in the private sector which ensures that people are able to take care of their basic needs for food, shelter and clothing. Since the goal of the employer is to make a profit and the objective of the employee is to earn a salary, then every transaction is centered around good customer service to meet that threshold. This keeps everyone accountable to their agreement of quality of service. It was the private sector that created the public sector. After America gained its independence from Britain, the thirteen colonies created the federal government to protect citizens from outside interference in order to provide for citizens’ well-being and happiness. They wanted the assurance to live safely, move freely and operate securely as they went about their daily duties and activities. It is through the process of campaigning that persons wishing to enter public service do so out of concern to strengthen national defense, further promote the education of minors, continue the commitment for justice and adequate law enforcement systems, as well ensuring that the development of broken infrastructures is carried out and maintained. This desire for the improvement and further advancement of the country’s economy and standing in the world should be the driving force for entering the government. This means that the process is started months or years before the filing deadline. Preferably, the person would have been involved in neighborhood associations and have participated in community work. They would either have made the choice or better yet, been asked to run for public office because of their ties to the community. The work of fixing laws, bridges, roads, rail, buildings, maintaining the streets to be free of litter and attending to the less fortunate and challenged in society, is best done by people who have shown integrity to the cause and loyalty to people who pay taxes and want to see their money spent appropriately as allocated for the benefit of the populus as a whole. But overtime, politicians have abused their positions and have allowed the American society to fall apart as they send money all across the world and line their pockets along the way. They no longer answer to voters who were under the impression that they were electing these supposed public servants. Politicians openly defy regular citizens and cower to the donors who selected them. The smug look on their faces sends the message that they are untouchable to the voter. But the jig is up. By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 12, 2024 IS AMERICA BECOMING A COMMUNIST NATION What does a communist country look like? It has people in the federal government who print massive amounts of money pretending to send aid packages all over the world but are really pocketing half of the funds. It has people at the state and local level, who open their state to illegal aliens under the guise of being a sanctuary city and then giving them all kinds of free stuff and handouts so as to use them as a permanent voting base when they want to cheat. It is a system of government that have used the plight of illiterate people against themselves, by introducing programs like free money to support women who get children from a man, but the man does not have to support those children. It involves erecting buildings and paying people to live freely in apartments without having any obligation that they are responsible for managing their affairs. It translates into paying for free schooling and college but instead of teaching the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic to students, they are indoctrinated with everything else that does not convert into them becoming a thinking and independent adult. And finally, communism is about paying people to stay home, instead of working. What is the reason for maintaining an underclass of people? It gives people in government permanent power at the expense of a group of people in the population who lives in fear of the boogie man. But if you have working brain cells, you, the reader maybe thinking or saying to yourself that someone has to work. I agree. Of course, in every communist society, people are going about their work, but there are those who work as part of the communist regime, while others are clueless to what is actually going on behind the scenes. The work in public offices, like hospitals, schools, shelters, and government agencies provides services to the underclass. These workers are taught that these grown people need help and so the workers think that they are the saviors of people who never got a foot up in life. The result is that workers in these agencies feel a sense of superiority as they swoop in to help the so-called less fortunate and an alliance is formed. What happens to this kind of communist society overtime? It eventually falls in on itself, because it is unsustainable. Babies become children and children become adults and must be expected to behave like adults who can take care of themselves and are responsible for their actions to themselves and to their fellowman.  It is not the job of government to suckle people from the womb to the tomb, but that is what the city of New York has become. A “Nanny State”. For the most part, too many black Americans have become subdued by accepting welfare and handouts. The flood gates to people from the Thirdworld has exasperated the problem because the assimilation process has been watered down.  The fusion of underclass and second-class has been taken hold. Are there any ordinary people in a communist society? Yes, there will always be businesses, and those who work in the private sector, but those people are heavily taxed to pay for a section of the population that has never seen the value in work. This is not what the Founders of the United States of America had in mind for people who wanted to join this great experiment. This is excerpt of what the American identity and way of life was intended to be: “The idea behind America is that people are allowed to come here, live here and be here so as to express themselves in ways that build a legacy not only for the individual but for the treasures of America. The American way is to become great. The principle behind becoming great is that great people make a great nation. The rule is that Americans believe that greatness brings wealth and build resources, and through the individual prosperity, the nation will benefit. The tenet is that no one is restricted, if they have some idea or talent, because it is their wellspring that lays the groundwork for the riches that America, as a whole, relishes”. It is time to restore the city of New York to its glory as the central figure of America! By Sophia K. Worrell **************************************************************** February 13, 2024 FAILING INSTITUTIONS These articles are for the sole purpose of reflecting and appreciating how great and powerful America is and why this is a fact. No other island or country in the world rivals that of the United States of America and yet, those who live here and come here are oblivious to what these 50 states represent.  In traveling to different states, it boggles the mind how different each state is in terms of its landscape and people. The perception of America that is held before landing on these shores is vastly different than actually being here. There is still untapped resources and beautiful landscapes that rival pictures, movies, videos or anyone’s perspective. There are many people who still appreciate this land, but far too many who do not understand the sacrifice of those who have gone before. Every landmark, institution and corporation resonate with stories of all these people in some form or fashion. But there is a disconnect and it is vital that we address where the failure started.  The power of the media in America is stronger than any other place that I visited or lived. In America, the media has been created to keep the population informed, as well as to entertain through television shows. It is where the promotion of products through advertisements is done. The media is also there to provide information regarding health, wealth and general well-being. All of this has resulted in multi-billion-dollar industries. Unheard of anywhere else. It is the job of journalist is to be abreast of what is going on in the nation, outside in the world and of course what legislations are being passed in government. The job of reporters is to inform regular people of what is going on since ordinary people are busy with their own jobs and do not have the time to listen to everything around them. That puts a heavy burden on journalists to be upstanding. They are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the general public to warn of danger. The newscasts who present daily news on current affairs are expected to have done thorough investigation to ensure that the stories are accurate. The sources must be credible, and interviews must allow for every side of the issue to be represented. Research is done with the goal of getting to the root of what is going on and observations must be as unbiased as possible. Life and death are definitely in the tongue of the newscasters. But now, journalists spend less time on the ground speaking to people to get to the facts and have now become opiniated. Even the weather forecasters are not seen as being credible. Reporters have become mouth pieces to push propaganda. They either glorify one-side or completely tear-down the other side and many times refuse to give all of the information. The subtleness is now full blown. Legacy media despise the Republican Party, they have disdain for Christians and absolutely hate patriots. They have been exposed as only covering anything democrat and making excuses for anything that democratic politicians do, even though that is not what the job of the media is supposed to be about. Words are very powerful. That is why editors and producers are there to validate the information before it is aired to the masses. In this election year, many candidates want to get their message out but Townhalls, press conferences and Rallies do not reflect what these candidates stand for and the people who want to vote for them. What is shown or presented shapes the attitudes of people and it is a disservice to this society to see what the main-stream media has become. In a day where social media is not as accessible to older people, and the elderly still depend on television, the media must be called out as being fake and for truly being the enemy of the people. But thankfully, there is alternative media that is filling the gap and people are using their faculties to decipher what is true from false. Sophia K. Worrell XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO February 14, 2024 BUILDING BACK BETTER On this freezing Valentine’s Day, we are winning. Although, last night we went down in defeat in the special election to fill a seat that the stupid Republicans gave up and we watched as 18 Republican senators signed unto a bill to send more money to countries that don’t give a shit about us here in the United States, we are winning. Even though there is an influx of illegal aliens invading our country, filling up our city shelters and burdening every service that they have never paid into, while they are beating up our police officers and giving us the middle finger, we are winning. It may seem as though we are being held hostage by policies that hurt us who are working and paying taxes. And we may be at the mercy of a government who is deliberately undoing every policy that is in place to ensure our safety and security, but we are winning. It may seem as though we cannot protect ourselves, our family, our fellowmen, our businesses or our city at this time, and that we are living through a nightmare, and we certainly are living through scary times.  But there is still hope and a way out. But you might ask “how are we winning?” We are winning because we are observing all of this blatant disregard for our civil liberties by politicians that refuse to adhere to their oath of office. We are realizing that the government of New York City is not interested in working on behalf of the residents and citizens, but their own interest. People all across America, and mainly in states or cities where there is democrat control are becoming aware that politicians who are democrats cannot run a state or city and use bullying tactics to hide their incompetence. We are the sleeping giant that they have awaken. We kept silent for fear of making life harder for ourselves, but now we have to take our lives back and our city as well. We have no choice but to push back against this madness, or we will not have a country or a city. It may seem as though the deck is stacked against us, and it is definitely stacked against us because these politicians are selected by entities outside of us; but we can do something about our situation. The problem is that these politicians pretended that they were solving social issues by coming up with programs to help the disenfranchised but were actually lining their pockets instead. Democrats have never built or created anything and have no idea how the economy works. They are filled with hubris and pretend that they are intelligent and that is why they have such a smug demeanor. It is because they think that we can never ever penetrate their fort. The good news is that they have been exposed! It is evident that our America society is on the verge of collapse. All of this occurred because we allowed the government to slowly encroach on our civil liberties and all the while the republicans who were supposed to be representing did nothing to impede them. But we cannot lay all the blame at these feckless politicians’ feet. We have to take some blame for what has happened to us. We can do this because the republicans are a reflection of who we used to be. Products of parents who have taught us to be submissive. Remnants of preachers who told us to turn the other cheek. Prodigies of teachers who did not properly prepare us for the world of work and politics. Now that we have analyzed the problem, we can arrive at a solution and now we get to work. We do this by accepting our part in permitting the government to have so much power and control over our lives. Next, we forgive ourselves for being distracted, busy with work, family, fun and freedom. We forget putting total trust in candidates who promised to represent us. By doing this, we can now fully participate in all elections and will vote every one of these politicians who have never had a real job out of office. From the resident of the White House to the senators, house of representative members, governor, mayor, attorney general, district attorney, city council members, school boards members and congressmen in our assembly, we must vote them all out and going forward vet the candidates who are seeking to replace them. Going forward we have to understand that private life and public life goes hand in hand. We must be engaged in every aspect of life that affects us. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. We may not have understood that it is the regulations and policies of politicians that impacted our daily lives, but now we do. Sunlight is definitely the best disinfectant. The light was shined and now we are awake.  We have locusts in our government at the federal, state and local level to exterminate. America is our home; if we don’t let the termites run us out of our homes, why are we running away from these locusts in government? Sophia K. Worrell ………………………………………………….

Worrell ########## February 17, 2024 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN & WOMEN If a child comes home and complain to his parents that he is being teased or bullied at school, what is the usual response of the parents. More often than nought, the mother would probably tell him to let the teacher know what is going on, but what would his father say or do?  More often than nought, the father would take his son outside and start training him for combat. Unfortunately, the second choice has been wiped away from our society. The ability for the so-victim to fight back has been eradicated from the picture under the guise of some flowery words. The following is an excerpt an individual who has a bachelor’s degree in law who has written an article about being bullied. The writer states, “ Being bullied is a frustrating and painful experience. When you are being bullied, it can often feel like things are out of your hands. While the onus is never on you to stop the bullying , and it’s never your fault, there are some things you can do to handle being bullied.” By Toketemu Ohwovoriole. There are two phrases in that excerpt that is troubling. The author did not seem to proofread her work and it calls into considering her contradictions in the passage. Her first suggestion: while the onus is never on you to stop the bullying, sets the child up for failure. It tells him that he is helpless and is at the mercy of his circumstances. On the next line, she reinforces this terrible suggestion: it is never your fault , this lays the blame completely on the other person. There is no way out for either the bully or the victim to resolve the situation. And despite making these statements, the writer goes on to list ways to handle the situation by recommending: Remove yourself from the situation. Try to talk to the bully. Talk to someone you trust. Stay confident. Enforce your boundaries. In one hand, she is telling the person being bullied that the onus is not on them to stop the bullying, and on the other hand, she is telling them to remove themselves from the situation. And what is even most ridiculous is to tell the person being bullied to talk to the bully. I am not sure if she understands how bullying works. And then she continues her expert advice to tell the victim of bullying to stay confident and enforce boundaries. If I am not mistaken, all of this sure sounds like the onus is on the victim to stop the bullying. The passage highlights what is wrong with females and schooling. The absence of mothers in the home is why people walk through water and never get wet. Mothers are no longer reading to their children in the home and there seems to be no evaluation of text in schools. Every student seems to be leaving school as an activist instead of a scholar. Mothers are in the workplace, instead of in the home and this is causing a crisis in society. The mother is the first teacher, and the father is the person who brings objectivity. A mother’s role is vital for many reasons. She starts the learning process in preparation for formal learning.  She sets the stage for the father to bring a balance to learning. But just as men have been emasculated, women have been beaten down as well and the child suffers with one-sided views that is divisive. Sophia K. Worrell +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ February 18, 2024 THE WONDERS OF FATHERHOOD & MOTHERHOOD The best advice that can be given to young people is to enjoy and envelop life because before starting a family. Females are wired to have children. Everything within females is driven by the thought of one day having a baby. The reproductive system which leads to the menstrual cycle is all in place for that miraculous occasion for a woman to become pregnant. The amazing technology of an ultrasound can give a preview of the life that is growing inside of a woman. Studies accurately correspond with the development of the baby. Parents will see that the stages of growth mirror the time frame laid out in books for organs to take shape. Bulges confirm life and movement. Fathers are not left out of the experience as the fetus respond to his stimuli. The swelling tummy reflects the growth that is taking place. Lamaze classes facilitate a smoother delivery, as it takes the focus off the pain because emphasis is placed on breathing. Young people have the freedom to serve their own interest before becoming parents, but that all changes when a baby comes into the picture. Holding that helpless baby changes everything. The responsibility for that new bundle of joy may seem overwhelming but doesn’t have to be that way. That is because as a young adult, you have been taking responsibility for your own life with lesser and lesser help from your parents and haven’t done such a bad job so far. Parents from both the father and mother are usually close by to lend any assistance. Their expertise should be seen as invaluable. Sophia K. Worrell %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% February 19, 2024 SELFISHNESS & NARCISM No man is an island. From antiquity to present day, people have always depended on the services of others in some form or fashion. It was the man who went out and hunted and brought the game home for the woman to cook. And what is constant is that children are dependent on their parents until they can take care of themselves. Everyone is dependent on someone to still plant the food, make the clothing, build the houses, and create modes of travel. Each of these require some kind of skill and training. However, there seem to be no training for the most important job in life and that is to be parents. The more advance societies become, the more selfish and narcissist people seem to be, as they are under the impression that they do not need anyone and that everything just pops up from nowhere. Parenting classes are needed because it will help young people understand why populating the earth is so essential to the sustenance of everyone. But why are young adults so nonchalant? Simply because parents have abdicated their jobs of exposing their children to service. There is a period of time when ‘it was all about you’ and another time when you can just focus on yourself, but the sequence in life requires the maturity to understand that you are needed. Producing a human being is the most consequential event there will ever be and that is not an inconvenience, it is something that must be thrived for in the process of continuing our civilization. Sophia K. Worrell ================================ February 20, 2024 LIFE OF SERVICE Our civilization has been wonderfully set up. There is nothing new under the sun. We in this modern society have the help of all kinds of resources to assist us with anything that we are undertaking. Life of service begins with us being obedient to our parents and respectful of others. Learning is an ongoing process and does not end when we graduate from high school, college or a trade. For example, a person who has been taught to drive and passes the driving test is not a driver just because they were given the license. They now have to put those lessons into practice when they are on the road alone, without an instructor sitting beside them. The way in which children behave and act has its start from the time they are born and are exposed to life outside of the mother. The way in which the mother attends to the needs of her child, sets them up or hinders them from forming proper relationships with others. In conjunction are communication skills that children will need in all areas of their lives. It begins with the mother reading to the young child, engaging in conversations, listening and having an exchange of ideas. It is further enhanced with the tiny tot having the freedom and flexibility to explore the world on the inside and outside with the father by their side as guide and moderator. Parents have to slowly let go of the reins and allow for more leverage as the child grows older for them to test out what they were told. As the young child expand their relationship beyond their parents, extended family and family acquaintances, they are being prepared for social interactions with people in the general public. This process of giving and receiving, speaking and listening, listening and testing, adhering and punishing is all preparation for their future interactions in other facets of their lives. This is all about them learning that they are to be served and that they must also serve in the chain of life. Sophia K. Worrell OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO February 21, 2024 THE DIGNITY OF WORK From the start of human creation, the first man Adam was assigned to work and that has not changed throughout the history of man’s existence. When God handed over the world he created to Adam and Eve, he could have handed them a finish product and let them just sit around all day. After the fall and their expulsion from the garden of Eden, the man still had to go out and work, while the woman was tasked with childbirth and the caring of her young. The lines were clearly defined. But overtime, men were attacked as being toxic and women were taunted for staying home and raising children. The work of men undermined the work of women. Comparisons were made between the man who was making a salary and the woman who was at home cooking, cleaning and caring for children. The discontent between husband and wife, father and mother led to kids who were overburdened with chores and who became pesky kids. Later, day care centers, nannies and public schooling became the guardians as men and women competed for salaries and wages. The health and wellbeing of children suffered along with the parents and inevitably the damage was done. Without proper supervision, children languish. Students are illiterate because no one is there to take interest in them completing homework assignments. The television is their babysitter. The cellphone is their playmate. Children are angry because they had to deal with their father being away so often and now, they have to cope with the absence of their mother as well. They have been left to their devices without a proper grasp of what they are getting themselves into. The anger of feeling neglected closes them off from sharing with their parents who are always bickering because the woman is overwhelmed, and the man is still going on as usual. The dignity of work begins with individuals ready to revive the people and people willing to embrace the work needed to fix this scourge. Sophia K. Worrell +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ February 22, 2024 THE AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA Our Founding Fathers declared independence from Britain and created a Constitutional Republic to put the power in the hands of the people to govern themselves, instead of being ruled by a king.  It was the Republican Party that continued that tradition, while the democratic party gained a strangle hold on some groups of people by offering welfare and the promise of healthcare and housing. After seizing a block of the population, to maintain the power grab, democrat politicians proceeded to divide Americans by pitting Chistian’s against atheist, rich against poor, blacks against whites, working class against those who are on welfare programs and heterosexuals against homosexuals. The Republican party’s mission is for less government, but the mission of the democrat party is to accumulate voters by offering handouts and free stuff. The amass of power has led the democrats to claw, bully, threaten, intimidate, pressure, terrorize and force heads of departments to give in to their Marxist, socialist and communists demands. When apposed, they use name-calling, censorship, cancelling, pandering, slogans, the abuse of language & messaging, and fear-tactics to silence viewpoints. Donald J. Trump has emerged as the leader of the Republican Party with the “America First” message. There was a shockwave when he became President in 2016, and in addition to all of his accomplishments was the exposure of the slow crawl to communism and socialism was underway. This has led to many people running for public office and parallel economies being set up along with alternative media to counteract the narratives. And now that the playbook of the democrats has been uncovered and exposed, it has led to them stepping on rakes and the overreach is backfiring. Sophia K. Worrell &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& February 23, 2024 THE INFORMATION WAR I have stated before that wars have been fought for territory and for power. At that time, the world was made up of European territories that were jockeying for position as world leaders. The dominant race was white people who operated on an advance, sophisticated level. In other territories, people were content to stay in the confines of their territory. The only movement was them roaming from one area to another to find food and fighting against each other for survival. The discovery of America by Europeans continued the war for additional land. It was the Pilgrims and Puritans who first landed on these shores to escape continuous persecution so as to get a new start to freely practice their religion. The worship God is the foundation on which North America was established. Battles were not foreign to Europeans. Combating enemy forces was in their bloodstream. There have been over 400 battles fought by North Americans and one of the first was the Battle of Lexington and Concord. The American Revolution started with American soldiers going against the British soldiers and thankfully only about 90 soldiers were killed. After the Constitution was written, a Civil War was fought to end slavery. That battle started outside of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania between the Confederate Army of the South, which was led by General Robert E. Lee and the Union Army of the North, which was led by General George Meade which led to a total of 46,000 casualties. President Lincoln gave a two-minute speech famously known as the Gettysburg Address later that year at the Soldier’s National Cemetery in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. A famous battle was the Invasion of Normandy, also known as “D-Day” where American Troops allied with Britain, Canada, and France to attack German forces which gave them victory that had a huge impact on the Second World War in Europe. The Allied Forces were led by Dwight D. Eisenhower of the US whereas the Germans were led by Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt. We are asked not to forget the Battle of the Alamo which was a pivotal event and military engagement in the Texas Revolution. It was fought between rebellious Texans and the Mexican army from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The Alamo was a fortified old mission in the center of the town of San Antonio de Béxar, defended by about 200 rebellious Texans, including Lt. Colonel William Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo Mission, killing most of the occupants. The first immigrants who came to the colonies, brought their study habits and educational prowess, their work ethic, their ingenuity and their love for progress. Freedom is the main tenant of the United States of America. There has been a lot of sacrifice to make North America into what it is today. There are a lot of men who have shed their blood all across this land and the world and whose bodies lay in the Arlington National Cemetery is the country’s largest military cemetery and serves as the final resting place for more than 400,000 military veterans and their immediate family from the fronts of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as World Wars I and II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, the Cold War and America’s Civil War. These are the events that has led to respect for national sovereignty and the flag is a symbol and reminder of the soldiers that sacrificed their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. Veterans are now revered for their service and yet, the history of this country is not being taught as it should. We are presently in an information war where everything has been turned on its head. Every institution has been infiltrated and watered down to meaninglessness. The question is being asked: “will this experiment of 240 years survive?”. It is time for a national revival. Sophia K. Worrell ————————————————————— February 24, 2024 LEADERSHIP There is a difference between being the leader and being a leader . The Leader is the one who is on top of any organization. The success of any business is the man at top. The man who starts a business has an idea that he wants to execute and as he brings people on, it is crucial that he conveys that idea clearly to his staff through words, actions or example. For instance, if his idea is to make widgets, he must have personnel who does his accounts, who does the marketing and advertisement, and he must have someone who oversees the legal aspect. Additionally, he has to have people who make the widgets and packages them for delivery and people who sells the products. He empowers his team by giving support, provided tools, and extra training for them to meet the goals of the company. He fosters growth and development by clarity which helps everyone understand their role and contributes to overall success. Leadership isn’t limited to formal titles; from the boardroom to the boiler room, people who embody the qualities of not just seeing the business as being owned by the person who founded the company, but a way in which they are able to run their personal business is a paradigm shift in thinking and working. A leader understands the concept of leadership in another way. They may not be in charge of starting the business or running the company, but they are the leader of their own lives. As the leader of their household which is dependent on the finances that comes from the work they do, then they must step up as a leader to ensure that continuous employment is maintained. This is done by adhering to the terms of the employment contract of employment. That would involve showing up to work on time and on the days agreed upon. It also involves understanding what their duties are and making sure that their assignments are turned in on time and with efficiency. The success of any country is also the man on the top who is the president. He must follow the laws of the land and in the case of America, that is the Constitution. The President of the United States (POTUS) holds a crucial role in the U.S. government. His duties involve reviewing Federal Laws (Bills). Congress consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives who makes legislation that he is either approve or vetoes. If he approves of the bill, it begins law. His main role in leading the nation is to ensure that citizens obey the laws that sets priorities for the country. He also works with Congress to decide how the budget is spent, addressing issues such as education, healthcare, defense, and infrastructure. The president serves as the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. He makes crucial decisions related to national security, military operations, and defense strategy. The president negotiates treaties with foreign governments with the help of the Senate who must ratify these treaties. They combined efforts plays a crucial role in shaping international relations. The president appoints members of the executive branch, including cabinet members, ambassadors, and agency heads. These High-Ranking Officials impact the functioning of various government agencies. Of his most monumental duties is to nominate federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. Senate confirmation is required for these appointments. The president represents the United States on the global stage, engaging in diplomacy, attending international summits, and addressing global challenges to representing the Nation. During emergencies, natural disasters, or crises, the president provides leadership and coordinates responses for Crisis Management. Some of his other entertaining and symbolic duties is to host state dinners, meets with foreign dignitaries, and participates in ceremonial events. Citizens may not be the leader of a country, but they are a leader of their own lives. They must be educated to what it means to be a productive citizen, a proper spouse, a good parent, a studious student, an ethical worker and most of all, an informed citizen of their political rights and responsibilities. As a leader, it is crucial that citizens hold their elected officials accountable, and that they understand what policies are in place and how it helps or hurts them. As a leader, they can run for office or assist a campaign as they are aware that politics impact them whether they are engaged or not. This is what being a holistic person is all about. Sophia K. Worrell ############################## February 25, 2024 NEW YORK, NEW YORK Growing up on a small island is extremely different from living in a big city.  The landmass itself contributes to any world view. Apart from the weather, which remains relatively the same, the way in which houses and buildings are constructed and the modes of transportation will vary. The lifestyle on an island is usually more of a laid-back atmosphere and the employment opportunities tend to be limited and more traditional as there is not a great demand for certain types of vocations. On the other hand, the pace in a big city is usually faster which lends itself to have pop-up shops and stores. New York City has gone through many changes and yet is still the epicenter of America. It is still known for its port of entry for immigrants and welcomes tourist from all over the world to enjoy its arts and culture. However, mismanagement has led to the rise of crime and violence and the tearing down of monuments that is supposed to serve as a reminder of what this nation was built on. Like many cities, New York has a long-standing tradition of being the city that never sleeps. But unfortunately, we have a group of politicians that are sleepwalking us off a cliff. Sophia K. Worrell OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO February 26, 2024 CLASS WARFARE It is the job of older folks to pass on their wisdom and experience to younger people. Older women must embrace younger women and older men must embrace younger men and share how they have overcome obstacles. Young people must be open to these stories and comprehend that although life seems different, everything is still the same. For instance, women have always worked and contributed in some way to society. It is not necessary to fight for the right for women to work and to compete with men. Black people have always worked in America and there is no reason to fight for their right to work and contribute to this nation. Immigrants have always worked in America and have always contributed in some way to the development of this nation and pathways to citizenship have been rigorous to ensure the stamina of people seeking to live and work. There are particular jobs that women can do and certain jobs that only a man can do. Women’s psyche is formed in a particular way that draws her to specific vocations and men are built to carry out fixed jobs. As an example, men are sent to war. Embedded in them is the ability to fight and defend. This is not the case with women. They are wired to care. European people are geared towards risks and adventure. People from third-world countries are more low-keyed. Some people go out there and start businesses. Others may not want the headache and would invest in the business. While many would prefer to just work and not have all the responsibility it takes to run the business. In school, there are always three types of children. Those students who are scholars and academically inclined. Then there are students who are not so bright. And right in the middle are students who are of average intelligence. In every society, there are the super-rich, the very poor and the middle class. These groups balance each other. There are only two genders: a male and female. They are supposed to balance out each other as well. Social stratification is intact. However, economic stability is volatile and must be attended to because the height to which the population can reach has not been truly addressed. Sophia K. Worrell @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ February 27, 2024 THE BROKEN LEGS THEORY Turning the Corner. If we as parents are not satisfied with what our children are doing, or not doing for that matter when they have become adults, we have to look internally and question where we went wrong. The same can be said for our nation at large. Today our society is a mess. Our representatives are either wayward or weak. Where does the blame lie? Citizens bear some responsibility for an out-of-control government. Just as training and discipline is required in the home to keep children in check and reinforcement of values and ethics is expected in the private sector to keep employers and employees in check, there must be policies to reign in public servants. Without laws and the reinforcement of those laws, society falls into chaos. The Broken Legs Theory has been playing out behind the scenes for many years but is now being enacted in plain sight. The concept of ‘broken legs’ is as follows. Break up black families and then ask for public assistance programs and welfare and expand cities into a Nanny State. Break the border and demand reform and money to fix the problem. Open pipelines and give money to countries that are up-to-no-good and then demand more money to resolve the conflict. Stop all drilling and lie that it is about saving the environment which impacts the making of products and the delivery of goods. Push for babies to be killed under the guise of my body my choice, while mandating people to take an experimental vaccine. All the while using name-calling tactics, shutting down any discussion and fearmongering to force people into compliance. Lack of courage. And while all of this is taking place, people are constantly surprised at the weakness of those who without fail do not push back in any significant way. The weakness of those who are supposed to be an opposition and the fear of the general public is reflected in the lack of response on either side.  When speaking up has become dangerous, fighting back can be deadly and disagreement comes with a cost, who can blame themselves or their representatives. Parents are supposed to help their children do courageous things. They are there to encourage bravery. But statistics do matter, and it takes one man to get up and dance for others to follow. And now many citizens of this country are coming to the realization that no one is coming to save them and even if the calvary did come, they still had to get in the battle. And so, for those who are objectively observing all of this, solidarity with those who have created this great nation and died to preserve it has never been so apparent. There is no difference between parents who thought that life was all about them, until they held their spawn in their hands and people who are recognizing that they have to take a stance to stop the collapse of this country. There is now no separation between those men who willingly signed up as troops and went to war and the women who had to pick up the slack and courageously balanced raising children and filling the gaps that men left and people who have to stand. In Philadelphia, during the summer of 1787, when the men emerged after four months of deliberation throughout the convention of states and a lady famously asked, “Well Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” To which Franklin replied tartly, “A republic, if you can keep it”. It serves as a reminder that the preservation of our democratic institutions rests not only on their establishment but also on the vigilance and commitment of the citizens who uphold them. The time has passed to fret about who was or is failing us and why they have sold out this country. Many parts of this country have been falling for a long time and only now like dominoes, the affect is being felt all over. There has been a clash of civilizations in the United States of America for a long time. Majority white European people against minority races. The chasm between a mind that gravitates towards development and an inferiority complex of existence. The ideals of first-world people versus the ideology of third-world people. The expanse of wealth and prosperity as others wallowed in abject poverty. And a middle class that sought to hold everything together as representative of the bourgeoisie. And just as in the times of war color, creed, race and class no longer matters. We all have our part to play, whether great or small. Sophia K. Worrell XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX February 28, 2024 MONEY/FINANCES/BUDGETING Many economists complain that the general population do not understand how to manage their earnings. Many people have high credit card debt, do not know how to budget their earnings and do not have a solid financial nest egg. Critics say it is the fault of the school and others point to parents who seem to be at a loss of how to properly prepare the kids for the future. In such a powerful country as the United States of America, it is inexcusable that so many young people leave school without a clue of what they want to do with their lives. It is a disgrace that these same young people are not taking advantage of the multitude of opportunities that are available. Somewhere, somehow, we as older folk have dropped the ball. At a time when we as individuals do not have to worry about dinosaurs or the hazards of brutal climates because we have managed to invent modern conveniences, people are just as lost as ever. Someone or some ones closed the public square and discussion which is paramount to people have been rebutted. The marketplace of ideas has been halted.  The building blocks of society has been suspended and inventing and innovating has been discouraged. For some reason, opinions have been censored, relevant information has been cancelled and now certain topics are off the table. People are too sensitive to hear criticism and standards must be lower for other groups of people. This insanity must be stopped, and thoughts and ideas allowed to flow so as to counteract the insanity that is hanging over us and crushing our will to live. We must welcome the knowledge of older folks. The feedback is paramount to our survival as a species. Now, no subject is off the table going forward. Sophia K. Worrell ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… February 29, 2024 NO MORE APOLOGIES Christians were taught that this world is not their home and that they were just passing through. And so, many believers in God, fell for the preaching of ministers and settled in a job waiting for the skies to open and Jesus to come and take them to heaven. Year in and year out every generation was told that they were in the world but not of the world and not to store up treasures on earth. These ministers rejected wealth-building and many lowly people struggled to amount any substantial capital. And if any of them needed money, they were told to pray to the Lord for a job and that was the answer to all their troubles. But non-believers or atheists were not buying into this malarkey.  They understood that trade was an important part of life and invested in stocks and assets. They took over the world that Christians abandoned and became the owners of property, businesses and large corporations and the consequence was that Christians became the hired help and renters. Education and degrees were so heavily criticized by preachers that Christians felt guilty for going into any field that yielded gains. This was not the case with nonspiritual people. They leaned into every diploma, certification and degree and became the teachers, professors and tutors and started pushing their view of life to children who were vulnerable. They became lawyers and judges and government officials and formed a coalition and overtime; Christians were shut out of every institution. But finally, Christians have come to the realization that they do live on this earth and that while passing through, they still need to take care of themselves and those around them. They are now aware that if they truly believe in God, then as his children, this earth belongs to them in this life and the life to come. The emphasis on just getting through each day has now been completely turned on its head. By waking up from the stupor they were put in, they realize that they have a lot of ground to make up because they had fallen for the obfuscation of truth. But is it too late? Emphatically, no! As long as there is life on earth, it is never too late. The truth is that Christians have to be vigilant going forward. While preparing for a new earth, they still have to take care of what has been given to them by their heavenly father. This awakening has led Christians to admit that the predicament they find themselves in is because they had dropped the ball to an insatiable group of people. This has ultimately led to a nation in crisis. The nation in crisis is actually the destruction of lives which in turn leads to a lot of mess on many fronts. The mess requires a clean-up crew to do major house-cleaning and there is unfortunately, a lot of cleaning up on aisle America. Regrettably, not having built up enough funding for this enormous project, Christians have to rely on the God of the Universe to sponsor this massive clean-up program. The initial bartering exchange has evolved to trading with money which inadvertently has resulted in purchasing power being done with cash or cards.  So, in order to attain the tools and equipment to clean up any mess it will require the backing of the Master of all the riches on this globe. Christians have to morph into cleaners so as to come to grips with the reality that finances are where the power lies, and control of the purse strings is how major problems are fixed. It takes tools and equipment to clean up the mess that has been made which can only be brought with money. As cleaners are solicited, additional money will be required to maintain the cleaning process. In order to keep and grow the movement of cleaners, funds must be attained to cultivate and train them in the work that has to be done. Qualified cleaners then have to be dispersed into the private sector and rise to the ranks of CEO and while that is happening, cleaners have to also get elected in the public sector and rise to the ranks of governor and mayor. Cleaners have to end government programs that take away the dignity of people and cleaners must restructure school systems to build the resources of minds in a tangible way. Cleaners have to become the new media and be tasked with reporting the news with honesty and integrity. Cleaners have to be brave in speech and action and most of all, be explicit with their children so as to not have weak, uninformed, low-information prodigies. Weakness and ignorance have ushered in a phase of madness and degeneration. Strength and knowledge will clean up the mess and steer everyone back into the essence of civility, high standards and accountability. We are in the last quarter of this game. Without further defense of values and apology for principles, Christians/Cleaners can come from behind and bring home a win. Remember, that in Christ we already have the victory. Sophia K.

Friday, April 25 Current Events    Calendar Community Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Jay Sapienza Kevin’s Corner Legislation Watch Letters to Officials Sophia Worrell Elections Membership Officers Letters to Officials To: Malliotakis *, Garbarino *, Meng *, Marjorie Taylor Greene no contact, Gillebrand *, Schumer*, Peter King no contact, Borough President Fossella no contact, Adams * and Hochul *: Yes, we all know the outcome of the Trump Persecution trial. Was anyone surprised? As a matter of fact, as soon as Biden “wanted” to have debates, we all should have figured that the “fix” was in. There is one phrase however, that I’ve not heard tossed around: Follow the Money. Now that little Alex Soros was given sole control over Georgy’s fortune and has had the White House doors thrown open to him numerous times and has had access to many unscrupulous, easily bought politicians e.g. Schumer, we could have made some logical assumptions. Corrupt Democrat New York State, City and Federal politicians are now as available as marijuana; the commonality is that they all stink. Let’s take a quick peek at Judge Merchan whose daughter is involved with the Democrat Party. Should we be following the money there? We already know that Fat Alvin Bragg has been bought over, along with many other DA’s from coast to coast. I believe that “Tush” James is in little Alex’s pocket. Little Alex has vowed to be “more political than his father”. How about the Trump jury; are there any possibilities there? Let’s keep an eye on that. Their spending habits should be scrutinized, particularly the lawyers who were part of the jury and whose influence on the jury we know nothing about. There is one devastating link from the Democrat Party that may connect up many of these awful “Bidenesque” schemes to what we saw play out this week: Little Alex Soros has been dating Huma Abiden who is Hillary Clinton’s top aide. Do you think perhaps Hillary is acting as Little Alex’s guiding hand and rearranging the chess board for Little Alex? Very scary prospect. Ron Prager, May 31, 2024 We have a president, Joe Biden, who really has no significance on the world stage. As his predecessor Obama did, helped fund the Islamist terror country, Iran. Now we have a situation where this mentally incompetent man is doing likewise: withholding needed war materials from Israel even though Congress has approved the funding for “Ukraine, Israel, and other U.S. allies”. Let’s look back into the history of why Michigan is a “battle field” state for the Biden presidency. It begins with Henry Ford, a man who hated Jews. He did not want to bring Jewish labor to work in his factories, but instead brought in Arab workers. That’s where we get the immigration of Omar and Tlaib and the many Jew haters in this region. These are only some of the roots of Jewish hatred. This hatred has existed “under cover of darkness” in the U.S. for many years with the German Bund hiding in plain sight during WWII. Think of the Nazi Bund in Yaphank, Long Island. Now, when Israel faces the necessity of removing Hamas, using its humanity, warning Rafah citizens, hoping to minimize the collateral deaths in Rafah where the last battalions of its mortal enemy Hamas still exist, Biden reneges on his willingness to provide Israel with the armaments that it needs to finish the war and recover the hostages, if any are still alive. Give Israel the armaments that it needs. It’s already funded and bilaterally agreed upon. I think we are getting a larger picture of Biden Ron Prager, May 9, 2024 Dear Bill O’Reilly , I don’t know if you realize this, but Soros’ real name is Schwartz and grandpa’ Soros changed it to Soros when the Nazis occupied Hungary ostensibly to try to protect his family from extermination. Grandpa’ Soros was also a member of the local Judenrat, the Council of Jews who probably were instrumental in revealing the hiding places of other Jews. That’s speculation but what isn’t speculation is that little Alex Soros promised that he would be more political than Georgy. We are seeing this playing out with little Alex being invited to the White House numerous times for nothing “more heinous” than meeting with that whore Chuck Schumer as well the brain trust of Kamala Harris. Other politicos were given massive sums of money; Alvin Bragg and a host of other no-cash-bail DA’s among them. Little Alex following in his father’s footsteps, seems bent on destroying the United States. I’m saving the best for last: little Alex is dating Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin. What can you make of this little piece of intrigue? Scares the hell out of me. Ron Prager, May 1, 2024 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, It’s time to recognize your failure as the President of Columbia. There should not be any Jew haters on your campus and their masks should be removed to expose the faces of hatred. If you’re too cowardly to call in the NYPD to remove these Jew haters as Speaker Johnson recommended, resign and restore order to Columbia. Israel will soon move to expunge Hamas from this world. If you’re too ignorant to understand the consequences of the Holocaust which it seems that you are, step down. You do not have authority anymore and you fail to understand the lessons of history. Never again! Ron Prager, April 30, 2024 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, Columbia University, under your presidency, has become a hotbed of Jew Hatred. Some of your finances probably come from an anti-Semitic Jew by the name of Alex Soros. Yes, the Soros’ real name was Schwartz. Grandpa Soros changed the family surname to Soros when the Nazis invaded Hungary and he was given certain privileges as a member of the local Judenrat, probably giving out the hiding places of other Jews. I believe you should educate your students (and the on-campus radical troublemakers) as to why Israel exists. Israel has been the home of the Jewish people for thousands of years. And you should explain to these ignorant protestors why the surrounding Islamic countries don’t want them. Columbia has demonstrated the need for Israel and the protection of Jews within the confines of your intolerant university. Never Again! Ron Prager, April 29, 2024 Something very interesting to note: it explains a lot that Hillary Clinton’s assistant Huma Abedin, who is dating someone who might be behind no-cash-bail DA’s and the anti-Israel riots on college campuses, the young Alex Soros who promised to be more political than his bastard father. This might explain the cash transfers via the Soros Foundations and its “subsidiaries” or offshoots such as the Tides Foundation or the Working Families Party. There’s a lot of Soros money floating around whether it be given to that weasel, Chuck Schumer or even funding the Clinton Foundation, DA Bragg or “Tush” James, maybe California DA’s or even that incompetent Gavin Newsom who has let his state fall into massive disrepair with cravings for the US Presidency. Just an ironic note: George Soros’ father changed the family name from Schwartz to Soros during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The family really are self-proclaimed Jewish anti-Semites. I wonder how many Jews did the Soros grandfather put in mortal jeopardy when he was a member of the local Judenrat, the council of Jews who knew the hiding places of many Hungarian Jews. Don’t expect to find any integrity among the Soros family. Ron Prager, April 27, 2024 Senator Schumer, Give back the money that little Alex Soros has bribed you with and perhaps donate it to Pro-Israeli causes so that Israel is able to build more bomb shelters and feed its displaced Northern Israeli citizens, and defend the integrity of its Country. It takes balls, Senator, to slap the faces of these Neo-Nazis that are wreaking havoc on college campuses and I’m glad that Speaker Johnson demonstrated this in front of the Nation. He knew instinctively what to do. Ron Prager, April 25, 2024 Brian Kilmeade , Perhaps you should report contributions given to many of our stellar politicians such as Chucky Schumer, Harris and many others given by Alex Soros, an anti-Semitic Jew whose grandfather changed their names from Schwartz to Soros during the Nazi overthrow of the Hungarian government. I have the horrible feeling that little Alex is helping to fund this horrible pro-hamas movement that we see on college campuses and paying off politicians such as Bragg and Willis to persecute Pres. Trump. I do hope that you look into this because I suspect that’s where the smell is emanating from. It’s no coincidence that all of the “tents” set up on these campuses look as if they’re all purchased from the same source. Follow the money. Ron Prager, April 24, 2024 Governor Kathy Hochul, It has always been a precept of law, with the exception of the Covid crisis, that a person’s face should be uncovered, not wearing masks that hide a person’s facial features. Covid is over and people should be arrested for hiding their faces. It is clear that those anti-Semitic protesters should be held accountable for their actions and not hide behind masks or pro-Hamas scarfs. Do your job and let the police do theirs. I think we should be allowed to know who these Jew haters are and let these college presidents stop making excuses for this Jew hatred. And also begin teaching what the Nazi concentration camps did during WWII. I’m beginning to believe that these “ignorant” college protestors do not have the slightest idea why there is a country like Israel. Ron Prager, April 23, 2024 Senator Schumer, I think that a truly brave person like yourself should intercede and speak at these pro-hamas rallies, and attempt to explain the Nazi Holocaust to these protesters. You might be able to explain the concentration camps where millions of Jews were tortured and murdered by these anti-Semitic Nazi monsters. These “college” students should not go through life in the ignorance that they are demonstrating. A brave U.S. Senator, such as yourself, should be able to explain that these Israelites are the survivors and progeny of the Nazi Holocaust. I’m sure a brave person, such as yourself with such laudable standing in this Government, should without hesitation, speak before these demonstrators and be able to make them understand that Israel for Jews, is the only One-State solution. I hope that you’ve noticed that none of the Arab countries want these so called “Palestinians”, countries that occupy massive land areas–there surely is a reason for that. As a Jew you should stand up for that and not attempt to interfere with Israeli elections. During wartime, which Israel is in, your voice should not be suggesting that Netanyahu should be replaced. Perhaps you should be questioning the mental competency of Joe Biden and ask that he should step down. It’s become very obvious that Joe is compromising our Country. Ron Prager, April 21, 2024 Senator Charles Schumer, It seems like the appropriate time to return the money given to you by the anti-Semitic Jew, Alex Soros and explain to your constituency how his large bribe has influenced your judgement, particularly in your anti-Israel stance. I’m personally ashamed of you and all the others caught up in this large bribery scheme initiated by the Soros family. Morality should speak louder than cash and you should know by now that the Soros family are committed to the destruction of the United States. Ron Prager, April 16, 2024 Peter King, On the destruction of safety and democracy by Alex Soros, following in his father’s footsteps only worse: Alex Soros is continuing on the course of destroying the United States by his unabashed large contributions to DA’s such as Bragg and Heasty with the goal of releasing hardened criminals into our streets. The contributions extend beyond DA’s to Senators like Schumer, and House and Senate Democrat Superpacs. I think that it’s time to find out, in front of Congress, Alex’s true gameplan. Alex has had seventeen invitations to the White House where such people as Harris, Pelosi, as though she needs the money, and others grovel for their war chests. Do you think that you might be able to spur the investigations into what young Alex has in mind for the “future” of our Country? Ron Prager, April 3, 2024 Borough President Fossella, Listening to the John Catsimatidis program this morning, you made reference to Carl Heasty in a positive light. I think that you should rethink that and realize that Heasty has been paid by Alex Soros. Without first verifying the Soros connection, I knew that money flowed to Heasty via Soros. I then confirmed that point and question why Heasty is following the No-Cash-Bail philosophy that the Soros family is promulgating. At this point, knowing that there are many DA’s and politicians being (undermined), paid off by the Soros family, the question is who and why Soros is trying to destroy this Country with his Open Society Foundation. At first glance, the Open Society Foundation “appears to be doing honorable work” but if you will notice, the reason Officer Diller was murdered is partially because of the corruption and deceit of the Soros family. It defies logic to not incarcerate the criminal elements that are not in jail as they should be. I believe that it’s time for the investigation into the Soros’ family motives as well as preparing yourself for the depths of the Soros family societal destruction. This tree of pay-offs goes to very deep depths of our political levels including the likes of Schumer, to the brainless Vice-President Harris, to DA Bragg, California’s DA George Gascon, and many more. You can view some of the Soros “influenced” politicians on the internet and you will be surprised by how many visits to the White House, young Alex Soros has made. Time to find out why the Soros family is wreaking havoc on the USA. Ron Prager, March 31, 2024 Annelle Sheline, It seems to be very easy to forget that Hamas is using the Gazans as human shields and that Hamas has squandered aid money that was meant for Gazans, building a massive and expensive tunnel network beneath Gaza with the eventual aim of destroying Israel. When Israelis are slaughtered, you do not speak of the Gazans’ inhumanity of their atrocities. Israelis have taken the most care of any nation to minimize collateral damage to Gazans and you’re relying upon Hamas run “health ministry’s” numbers. You should be concerned about the propaganda value of these numbers. Do you really think that if given the opportunity to slaughter Israelis, Hamas would take care not to murder innocents? Their actions have already affirmed that and according to Hamas there are no Jews to be spared. Your resignation from the human rights department of our failing Biden government is really a welcome decision for the people who want to see Hamas extinguished from mankind. The less apologists for Hamas, the more we can see a humane outcome to the war that Hamas began. Ron Prager, March 30, 2024 Mayor Adams and Gov. Hochul, We don’t need high-tech machines to keep the subways safe. We need a commitment to incarcerate and institutionalize those who make this City and subway as unsafe as it has become. As long as we have a government bribed and coerced by money from the likes of Soros and we don’t put in the necessary impediments to the destruction of society, we are going to have the carnage and mayhem that we are now seeing. It’s an obvious consequence when we have Braggs and Heasties as well as “other” misguided social “justice” warriors making policy that no rational society can endure. Mr. Mayor, you made the horrible mistake of declaring this a sanctuary city and Ms. Governor you made the horrible mistake of not ridding New York of the Soros infestation. I know a lot of politicians are licking the soles of Alex Soros boots including our “esteemed” Senators Schumer and Pelosi (why she needs the money leaves me dumbfounded). This has to stop. High-tech machines are no match for courage in our Political infrastructure. Ron Prager, March 29, 2024 How did we wind up with terrorist attacks in Israel? This is not unexpected. First, we had an “ex” president who wanted the destruction of Israel: why else would he have given a pallet full of cash to Iran? Was Iran our “friend” throughout this? Wasn’t Iranians chanting death to the big Devil, the U.S. and death to the little Devil, Israel? Obama knew this and Obama’s puppet, Joe Biden knew this as well. The Obama puppet, Joe Biden does not have the courage to stand up to anybody. Ol’ Scranton Joe has been weak on everything. He didn’t mention the origins of Covid to Xi, or the fentanyl  deaths in the U.S. to Xi either. We have a coward and crook in the White House fronting for his son and bagman, Hunter. And now when Israel needs us as a partner, what does Joe do but weasel out of what once was a solid commitment to Israel. I personally believe in a one state solution – Israel. If the Arab population wants to stay in Israel, they should do so. Why do you suppose that none of the Arab states want them? They are a problem and the Arab states know this too well. Hamas has to be exterminated and Biden does not have the balls or comprehension of the reality to understand this. Ron Prager, December 6, 2023 Senator Charles Schumer, As a Jew, I’m beginning to see the awakenings of a contemporary Nazi movement in the United States. We both see something called a “Pro-Palestinian Movement” here in our Country; bluntly, we are finding out who the real Jew haters are. Some of the most vocal Jew haters have a sounding board for their vitriol, and they are in Congress denying that Jews have a right to defend themselves. Many Jew haters are also in what is supposed to be institutions of higher learning, and the good thing is that some of their benefactors have stopped providing them funding. Are there Pro-Palestinian countries in the Middle East funding some of these colleges like “U of P” and Columbia? I would like to see the colleges and universities who have promoted this neo-Nazi movement denied Federal funding and I would like to see a commission formed to investigate these educational institutions. The promulgation of Jews not having the right to defend themselves is an intolerable concept. It would be comforting to think that Biden’s Middle East visit was highly successful, but it seems that most likely it was a continuation of the Obama appeasement of Iran policy. Didn’t Obama sneak a pallet laden with cash out to Iran? And didn’t Biden’s “exchange” of hostages for a release to Iran of $6 billion, $1 billion per hostage? A real and decisive energy policy would ameliorate that type of nihilism that this Nation is experiencing being fomented by climate change hysteria. We are not producing oil and gas, but rather purchasing them from dictatorships like Iran, Venezuela and Russia and at the same time depleting our emergency oil reserve, which it looks like we are in great need of refilling. This green energy “program” is a fraud – consider how much energy is needed to build and maintain a wind farm. At what point will a wind turbine be fully amortized? “Green Energy” is a nice thought but we’re not ready for it as of now. And if you’ve been paying attention to the news, which I’m sure you have, don’t most political pundits agree that Obama is running the Government? Biden is not capable of doing so and nobody wants Harris making policy. Buying up Iranian oil is subsidizing Iran’s proxy war against Israel. Ron Prager, October 24, 2023 Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, There seems to be some very warranted concerns regarding 5G cell phone transponders above and near living quarters in this neighborhood. I don’t think that this is a “henny penny” reaction having already seen some clear and documented medical problems associated with 5G and I think that there should be a moratorium on 5G tower installation until we understand the validity of these concerns. Do you think that shielding should be provided to tenants of these building to mitigate these concerns? I think that this may prove to be a compelling concern, now and in the future. What are your thoughts on this Assemblyman Hevesi? (The recommended “safe” distance from these 5G towers is 50 meters. I suspect this may be a very conservative estimate from “communications industry assessments”.) Ron Prager, July 22, 2023 John B. King, Jr. is the 15th Chancellor of the State University of New York (SUNY) Chancellor King, I’ve been fighting “affirmative action” for nearly 50 years hoping that merit prevails over race. I took the Community College of Brooklyn (I believe it is now called the New York Technical College) before the State’s Human Right Commission for racial discrimination in about 1970. Affirmative Action was wrong then and it is wrong now. I am glad Asian people understood that merit should prevail over race. I had already graduated Brooklyn College before a policy of open enrollment at Brooklyn College was enacted; it proved absolutely devastating for academics. My personal feeling is that students who show potential merit, should be given the opportunity to hone their reading and math skills in “post high school programs” in either after school classes with booster programs to give poor performing students a second chance or post-high school classes emphasizing academics to bring them up to speed. If you don’t recall, “affirmative action” students failed out of Brooklyn College at extraordinarily high rates after that policy was enacted. The other side of this State’s shortcomings is that Gov. Hochul has failed to recognize that legalizing marijuana usage may have a devastating effect on academics, and this State’s Government failed to research short and long term effects of marijuana. Their tax plan does not seem to be working out too well either – street selling will probably thrive over Hochul’s plan. Rethink your plan Chancellor King. The Supreme Court’s decision will finally have long reaching and positive consequences. Ron Prager, July 4, 2023 Senator Schumer, I was delighted to see your photograph with Alex Soros. It gives me the sense of probably who is now pocketing the Soros money. Remember that Georgy Soros’ name was Schwartz before his father changed it to protect his family from the Nazis – ironically, the family is Anti-Semitic. I know that Georgy’s father was also a member of the local Judenrat, the Jewish council that made it easier for one Jew to betray another in return for some sort of concession and make the Holocaust an easier task for the Nazis to accomplish. That is possibly how Anne Frank’s family was discovered. You, Mr. Schumer, are collecting the same payoffs that the Soros DA’s are receiving and I’m glad that I was able to see you, among several other prominent Democrat politicians including the incredibly incompetent V.P. Harris, and you with a shit-eating grin, aiding the hell bent Soros’ destruction of America. What you will do for money and power! We already know about Biden and his lust for money and how he will sell America down the river along with his crack smoking son. We now have an extremely compromised president who doesn’t give a damn about our Country and you know this already and it seems that you’re willing to jump into bed with this quisling. As far as the Soros family, this is one Jewish Hungarian family that I’m sorry that the Nazis didn’t put in Auschwitz. Our Country would have been better for it. cc:  Andrew Garbarino, Grace Meng, Kirstin Gillibrand, Kathy Hochul, Simcha Felder, Andrew Hevesi Ron Prager, June 15, 2023 Ms. Hochul, I didn’t realize just how incompetent you really are. You’re really out of touch with how U.S. citizens feel about illegal immigration and what the disastrous consequences will have on life here. This seems to be the time to acknowledge the disaster that an incompetent and compromised president will sow. We all saw it in play with the Chinese Communist Party’s spy balloon over our missile silos and strategic defense commands. This wasn’t a happenstance. This is what we get when a U.S. president is on the take. Better take a larger look at the disaster of the illegal alien crisis. And please read the following: Mr. Mayor, It looks like you got sucker punched from all directions. There is a clear and objective distinction between “asylum seekers” and “migrants”. We’ve had “migrant” worker programs for years. They had to come through the border legally, but the people who are seeking asylum had to show a clear legitimacy to their and their family’s safety. You welcomed everyone coming across our Southern Border with no thought of consequences to this State’s (and other states’) welfare and economies. Your lack of anticipation of the consequences to this City’s livability is unconscionable. Did you give a thought to the educational system? The hospital system? To the homeless and mentally ill crisis that we are experiencing? The criminal crisis under the failing stewardship of Soros’ lacky Bragg? Your heart might have been in the right place but your planning and practicality has been a total failure. What we are now experiencing is the predictable and deliberate destruction of the United States by a mentally incompetent president and an administration that is replete with failures. Ron Prager, May 23, 2023 Dear Governor, I’m been very amused by thinking that the Hero Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes would have risen to the occasion when the NYC subway train was invaded by a lunatic. Remember that she hid in a bathroom during the January 6 th incursion on the Capital? I’m sure she would have risen to the forefront of that subway car and subdued that madman who had over 40 priors and an outstanding warrant against him. Yes, bravery would have shone on her face. The reality is that she probably would have shit in her pants in such a confrontation. She also aligned herself with the anti-white racists in calling for the heroic Marine, who is white, to be jailed. This man is a hero and should not be subjected to any grand jury investigation. Mayor Adams gets it. I think we all know the real criminal – Alvin Bragg for not either institutionalizing or imprisoning this mentally ill person. The crimes that this man committed included some violent crimes. Lee Zeldin would have ridded this City of the Bragg Blight immediately. I think that’s what you should be doing and vindicate this Marine hero. Mayor Adams, If these “phony” activists were so outraged after the death of that subway lunatic, why didn’t any of them offer to help him before he died? I think that Marine should be considered a hero after subduing a man who threatened an entire subway car and also having over 40 priors and a current arrest warrant. Do you really believe that this moron Alvin Bragg should remain in office? He’s really the man who should be charged with murder for his failure to provide help for a clearly disturbed man. It is a sad case and one that could have been avoided if these phony “activists” were really seeking to help him. I don’t really think that any of them had the guts to get involved, and the Marine should be thanked for his braveness and actions. Governor Hochul, Stop with the drama. This was a potentially dangerous man who should have received help after more than 40 priors. If that race baiter, Sharpton could have helped why didn’t he? You know the answer that the man is erratic and should have been committed to an asylum a long time ago. He might have been helped, certainly if Bragg was really concerned. And you should not have been in contact with Sharpton. He has a rather infamous and corrupt past. Think what the passengers on that F train experienced, put yourself in their places and I think that you can forget the histrionics. The Marine was a hero and thank God that he was on the train at that time. Ron Prager, May 6, 2023 Congresswoman Meng, At what point are we, as a nation, going to actually view Biden as cognitively impaired? Isn’t it time for this “president” to hold a news conference that is not pre-orchestrated, where Joe is going to show that he can think on his feet? Announcing that he is running for Presidency on videotape just reminds me of his “rat hole” campaign that he did last time. The Nation is at stake. Everything Joe has done has failed, from his cutting off the Keystone XL pipeline to his exit strategy from Afghanistan to his selection of the most incompetent Cabinet in our history – where is this going to end? His blaming of President Trump for all these failures is growing thin; Karine Jean-Pierre is clearly out of her league, overusing the term “clearly” which is opaque as she is able to get. I’m sure by now that Biden’s abject failures and corruption have become very obvious. His keeping of a Chinese Communist Party’s spy balloon aloft for days, until it completed its mission has put this Nation under a very compromised situation. His failure to provide Taiwan with armaments while promising the needed supplies is going to lead to very poorly thought-out consequences. Get this compromised president out front of an array of independent journalists and let’s hear what he is able to say. I fear that he is only capable of talking about chocolate chip ice cream and will melt under any substantive discussion of foreign affairs. Ron Prager, April 26, 2023 Mr. Mayor, I sincerely hope that you did not anticipate the consequence of opening up New York City as a sanctuary city. It would have been foolhardy to suggest that you did not foresee that all social services would have been overwhelmed by this illegal alien crisis, and you are absolutely correct in asking help from the Washington government who actually promoted the “come on over” agenda. We have a compromised President, an incompetent Vice-President and a pathetic liar as Secretary of Homeland Security, Mayorkas who likes to pretend that the Southern border is “closed”. Your clearer course, Mr. Mayor, is to isolate the illegals and begin doing background checks and deportations of this mess that Washington created. I think that you’re beginning to see the truth of where things stand. Ron Prager, March 7, 2023 Senator Gillibrand, It’s wonderful that you have secured money for New York State’s infrastructure, but it is incumbent upon you to study the actual expenditures. We have the most corrupt government in my lifetime starting at the top with Biden. And also, the least competent Vice-President and Cabinet that I’ve ever seen, chosen by race, gender, homosexuality while actually omitting competency as a criteria for the position. I suggest that careful attention is paid towards the granting of contracts and a complete list is made available for the public to see. Ron Prager, March 3, 2023 Rita Cosby (WABC-AM), A poignant moment in my recall is when the bodies of U.S. servicemen were off-loaded from a plane after the Afghanistan debacle, and Joe was busy checking his watch. I think we all know by now who Biden’s paymaster is. This is an area that’s been skirted around and I think we have to take a harsh look at Joe Biden. He is not in the impeachment arena anymore. It’s much more unsettling. Joe, Hunter and Jim should all be perceived as possibly serving as traitors to our Country–for large amounts of money. Why was that spy balloon not taken out immediately? It was able to surveille all our nuclear silos and strategic air force sites from one end of the country to the other. Do you really believe that Joe was concerned if the debris from the balloon fell on Americans? It could have been safely downed over some of the least populated parts of our Country. Again, how was Joe Biden able to afford the properties that he has on a Senator’s salary? At some point soon, I would hope that you would spend some significant time on your program examining the events that bring to light Biden et al. treasonous behavior. It pains me to think that we really have a traitor-in-chief. Ron Prager, February 18, 2023 Congresswomen Meng and Malliotakis, and Congressman Garbarino, There apparently is one thing that George Santos did not lie about: our current President does not have any integrity either. This was the one thing that Tulsi Gabbard fired at the prevaricator Santos, a man who seems to think that he is just embellishing upon his very obvious fabrications. But he did point out that the man holding power in the White House with his folksy lies and obfuscations of the truth, is not held to the same standard of integrity. And in Joe Biden’s case, is not acting upon or solving the very disasters that he is causing in our Country. Through his drug-addled son, Joe has been receiving millions of dollars from Ukraine, Russia and China, a very compromised position for a U.S. President to be in. Old folksy Joe has landed us in an illegal alien crisis, an energy crisis, an inflation debacle, and a crisis in pretty much anything he has put his inept paws on. I believe Santos should not be seated, I also believe that Old Folksy Joe should step down or be impeached for the same lack of integrity that George Santos and he have both created for themselves. Ron Prager, December 30, 2022 VIA EMAIL: NYSAG@ag.ny.gov, Letitia.james@ag.ny.gov December 21, 2022 Ms. Letitia James New York State Attorney General Office of the Attorney General The Capitol Albany, NY 12224-0341 Re: Letter to NYS Legislature on Election Integrity Petition Filed by Queens County Republican Patriots in 2021 Dear Attorney General Letitia James: Attached please find a letter addressed to the New York State Legislature by 12 Queens County Committee Members on December 11, 2022 to inquire about the status of the Election Integrity Petition dated October 26, 2021, which was forwarded to the New York State Legislature by the Queens County Republican Patriots (“QCRP”) on or about October 27, 2021 via email and certified mail. (See attached signed letter). We are including a scanned copy of the QCRP petition letter for your perusal. (See attached petition letter, without signatures). We are looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. We would greatly appreciate acknowledgement that you have received our letter and its attachments. With a spirit to serve as Queens County Committee Members, Aura Moody (33 AD, 50 ED) Joseph Concannon (33 AD, 9 ED) Elena Chin (24AD, 62 ED) James Coppola (AD 24, ED 62) Laura M. Schmitt (AD 24, ED 49) David Abraham (AD 28, ED 30) Peter J. Spanopoulos (AD 24, ED 48) Joycelyn Jack (33 AD, 50 ED) Phil Orenstein (24 AD, 56 ED) Suzanne L. Chronowitz (AD 26, ED 21) Ira Harris (AD 24, ED 56) Ira Chazan (24 AD, 58 ED) Response from the NYS Attorney General to Complaint Filed Against the NYS Legislature by QCRP on Election Integrity Petition dated 1-10-2023 Congresswoman Meng, It should be very clear by now that we have an immensely incompetent administration. To trade a second-rate basketball player for a very dangerous and active arms dealer? Leaving behind an American ex-marine, Paul Whelan in this lopsided prisoner exchange? Everything that Biden has done has been a disaster; from the shutting down of the XL Pipeline, the Afghanistan debacle, his son’s dealing with Burisma, China and Russia, Biden’s constant lying about his own achievements, his selection of an incompetent Vice-President, his open border policy, the money that has been forked over to him by his son – we have a very compromised President. His selection of lightweights in such positions as Secretary of State and Secretary of Transportation who have no “gravitas”, a word that we do not hear at all about Biden’s cabinet. A Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, who has lied under oath to Congress saying that the “border is secure” while having massive security risks streaming over the border. Unless you speak up, I will not vote Democrat anymore – even if I like your work. At stake is the integrity of this Country and having a President who lacks integrity contributes to the unease and destabilization of our Country. Ron Prager, December 12, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, It seems that DA James received a large amount of her “donations” from the Tides Foundation which is related to George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. It is funneled through the Working Families Party and should be pointed out and highlighted that it is the same source as Alvin Bragg’s contributions are coming from. Little wonder that “Tush” James is on the no-cash bail express. It also explains why the same smell emanates from Ms. James as from Soros and Bragg. Could you please look further into this. Soros’ goal appears to be the destruction of our Country along with some other Democrats. This seems strange considering that Soros’ father changed his name from Schwartz to Soros to evade the Nazis, and our Country seems to be on a fascist, anti-Semitic path. Ron Prager, November 25, 2022 Mr. Mayor, It’s bad enough that you’re not up to the job as mayor, but since when is our First Amendment Right been abridged? How are you going to define “hateful speech” without screwing with the First Amendment? Why are you not pointing your finger towards the idiots who left our borders wide open? You’re pretty silent about where to place the blame for the illegal alien disaster. Ron Prager, October 10, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, I think it should be clear by now that Biden is a complete and dangerous failure. We’re now poised to expect a PRC invasion of Taiwan. The question is when and we should expect it during the Biden administration because he’s recognized as being a very weak leader. Everything he’s done, so far, has been a failure. He is busy blaming President Trump for everything that divides this country but he won’t look to himself: from his taking large bribes from China, Russia and the Ukraine via his son and all of our many crises that didn’t occur before him. Biden is a tainted and compromised political hack. When I vote, I typically split the ticket but after seeing how incompetent Biden is – think Afghanistan, XL Pipeline, open borders, his phony inflation reduction plan, and remember when the bodies of American soldiers were being taken off the plane and Joe was busy looking at his watch? This time I’m voting straight down the line Republican. This Country will be in shambles by the time Joe leaves office. I wish I was joking and I think you can see that for yourself. I sometimes ask myself “who is steering the ship”? I don’t think that Biden even knows where the ship is; my guess is that it’s probably called Obama, Rice and Hillary. We’re heading for an iceberg. Ron Prager, September 3, 2022 Mayor Adams, What a wonderful idea of having a “hip hop” museum in the Bronx – no crime there. Just a pleasant place to live or get shot, knifed or get beaten. I did notice that not too many white people were shown in your celebration photograph. How much of that money came from private contributors and how much of that came from such stellar organizations like Black Lives Matter ? Why wasn’t that same money used to fund educational institutions and programs? I don’t think “hip hop” is what I would consider “culture” unless you wore your pants below your waist exposing your underwear. Perhaps the idea is to have non-literate Black teenagers blaring out that crap instead of staying home and studying or dare I say, studying at libraries? And I didn’t recall seeing or hearing about an assessment of the effects of marijuana which seems to have higher frequencies of use in Black neighborhoods and the negative consequences of marijuana use doesn’t seems to have been taken into account. Why isn’t money spent on countering drug use, unless of course you want the tax revenue to help fund “hip hop” museums? Don’t waste the taxpayer’s money on trash and put together some real anti-crime programs. You really seem to be failing big time. Ron Prager, August 5, 2022 Dear Governor Hochul, I’ve seen that you have taken $20,000 from the Soros family. (Haven’t had a chance yet to view his shell companies contributions to you.) This might explain your reluctance to remove DA Bragg because you might be in the same game as he is on the no-cash-bail money train. You had the opportunity to remove Bragg after the subway shooting, but you didn’t. That would have been your last chance for election. It is bad enough that you’re pushing for that football stadium in Buffalo with taxpayers money. You’re probably a nice person, but corruption is plaguing our State and it seems that you’re in on it. Ron Prager, May 20, 2022 Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, George Soros’ Open Society Foundation appears to be a “misconstruction” of democracy and should be scrutinized very carefully. Here in New York, we are confronted by an ideology that seems bizarre at its least, and severely detrimental at its worst. It seems that the “open” in open society seems to be hell bent on opening prison gates to our worst offenders without considering the dangerousness of the persons who are let go without detentive incarceration. Soros is paying off DA’s to promulgate his own sick ideology and these include Manhattan DA Bragg and $20,000 “contributed” towards Attorney General Letitia James’ campaign fund. I’ve yet to scrutinize Soros’ shell companies and his own family’s contributions to Bragg and James, but it seems like our justice system has been tainted by BIG money. We are not voting for candidates anymore but puppets on strings. These people have to be called out (as many that I’ve not researched as of yet) for endangering the safety of our society. Consider the removals of James and Bragg. I realize our Governor does not have the courage to do so, and may yet be caught up in her own financial scandals revolving around a Buffalo football stadium and her own husband’s connection with it. Ron Prager, May 17, 2022 DA Letitia James, It has come to my attention that you are a proponent of “cash bail reform” thereby letting criminals back into the streets without any cash bail. It has also come to my attention that George Soros donated to you $20,000 ostensibly to promulgate his anti-American programs (along with the likes of Alvin Bragg who should have been relieved of his position by our cowardly Governor). I have not investigated if you’ve received any payment by Soros’ shell companies, but that will be looked into further. What I suggest that you do is either return Communist Soros’ funds or resign from your position. You should make a full disclosure of your “contributors”. Ron Prager, May 16, 2022 John Catsimatidis, I just hate to write a “Dear John” letter, but you had better look more carefully into the doings of yourself and some of your employees. George Soros contributed, from what I can find so far, $20,000 to the campaign of Letitia James, our esteemed DA. If you’ve noticed she has suddenly come out for “Bail reform – no cash bail”. I suspected such a link, and you didn’t check into her more thoroughly and gave her $41,000 according to an article in the NY Post. You will find confirmation of the Soros connection attached to this note. I’ve listened to your programs quite frequently and have been very impressed with Rita Cosby and James Golden. Overall, I like you but please be more careful where your money goes. You could have figured out Ms. James’ political stance a long time ago. Ron Prager, May 14, 2022 Mayor Adams, It’s time for you to step up to the plate or step down. Your handling of the crime problem is abominable. You put virtual targets on the backs of your anti-crime units and it seems that the only thing that you’ve done since you took office is try to make the cover of GQ magazine. Restore Stop-Question and Frisk! Don’t you think that requesting to address the State Assembly regarding and rescinding this idiotic no cash bail policy should be a priority for you? Don’t you think have a heart-to-heart meeting with Hochul and focus on the removal of Alvin Bragg as well as forbidding future nominees to the position of Borough DA from accepting money from shell organizations or directly from the Communist George Soros who seems bent on destroying the United States? Don’t you think that qualified indemnity should be restored to the Police force? Again, step up or step down. We did not elect another de Blasio. Ron Prager, May 9, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, It should be very clear by now that Biden is having severe cognitive difficulties, so much so that he must be immediately removed from office under the 25 th Amendment statute. It leaves the unfortunate circumstance of his replacement by a woman who is clearly not up to the job. Harris has demonstrated her lack of competency already and her foreign and domestic excursions have been what I would call an embarrassment. She has to be removed first before Biden is removed. A horrible gaff has been committed by Biden which has not been spoken of as yet: telegraphing his intentions of what the Country will do as far as arming Ukraine. That should be handled quietly and discretely – sub-rosa. This might provide justification by Russia to use its nuclear capability as a retribution for our “direct involvement” and fodder by Putin to direct blame to the U.S. for our killing of this brutal Russian military. Biden should keep quiet and just do what needs to be done without any fanfare.In addition, we need a plan to repatriate illegal aliens to their home countries. Severe sanctions on hiring should, at least, be the first step. We need a deterrence for the illegals to understand that we have a fair immigration policy and its abuse will not be tolerated. Finally, Biden and Psaki’s parroting that inflation is because of Putin’s war, and that it is a “temporary” state of affairs: How stupid does this regime think that the American people are? Ron Prager, April 24, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, The clock has almost run out. At this point it seems imperative to get Ukraine the armaments that it desperately needs. It’s clear that Biden is compromised mentally and is politically compromised with his son’s dealings with China, Ukraine and Russia. Biden is not capable of acting in the best interests of the United States; he probably wasn’t ever. He needs to be removed from office and pity us if Harris assumes Presidency, but there is no choice and there is no time. Once the Russian troops start moving under the command of General Dvornikov, we cannot be assured that chemical or tactical nuclear weaponry won’t be used. We know that Biden is slow to act and every time he is left to his own words, we really don’t know if his stupidity or cognitive failures won’t initiate WWIII. Please start the invocation of the 25 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and get the weaponry to the Ukraine without Biden telegraphing our intentions. And please try to rally members of Congress to take action. This must defy and be above political affiliations. Ron Prager, April 24, 2022 Governor Hochul, I am glad that you spoke out on the “No Cash Bail Reform” policy, now it seems equally important to remove DA Bragg from his position. My preference is that you haul him out by his ear, but any way you chose to oust him, is fine with me. Also, having the “Anti-Crime” unit so visibly identifiable looks like it might physically endanger the police working in that unit. Plainclothes seems like the more workable solution for getting guns off the streets. I hope that you agree with me on that. Ron Prager, March 22, 2022 Unanswered question on why congress repealed the stretch provision Dear congress lady AOC.  Thanks to the town hall invitation, Can’t get up to the Bronx but am waiting for your answer to an old question. If you hold a town hall here in Jackson Heights I’ll try to make it.  I want to join senator Ramos virtual town hall. I have written to you several times and do not understand your not answering us. You provide this opportunity to ask, so please be fair in return please answer. I will l use your answer to pass on to clients that I gave advice to.   I told them I asked congress why, after all these years, the congress in the Secure Act took away the valuable stretch IRA and waiting for a reply, I am still waiting for you answer why congress does what it does.  It’s a good provision to put back in, if congress doesn’t like it anymore, explain why then have it apply for future, not cool to apply to money accumulated over the past 35 years. The question is why in the secure act, congress took away the lifetime aspect of the ROTH stretch for funds added all the years prior to the SECURE act.   Congress hung me out with my clients and I need an answer to give them, whatever the reason is please tell me even if it is a bad reason which it must bes.   Please tell me what to answer and BTW how did you and other Queens congressmen vote?   What did you thing of the stretch?  In what way and for who is it good? What made congress break the 35 year old promise that the stretch would be there when these elderly people pass away.  I had no idea Congress was even allowed to take it away after it was used to encourage the Roth savings.  Was it good for anybody!  I think only bad. I am an actuary now specializing in pensions, and where the circumstances made that a good plan have Illustrated the Roth w stretch, thinking it could not be relied upon so did not consider its dis-enactments.  Some clients have accumulated hundreds of thousands of $ in ROTH IRA retirement savings.  For someone for whom it’s important to encourage the son or daughter to keep the money under Roth Protection for their retirement rather than spending it as soon as inherited like the law passed in the 1990’s said to do now it is so unfair to take away what was counted on.  That money was contributed while working and is a major amount to these retired clients. Arthur Teiler 33-24 91 Street Apt 4W Jackson Heights, NY 11372 March 21, 2022 Governor Hochul, If you fail to rescind the “No Cash Bail Reform Law” and fail to remove DA Alvin Bragg from his position, I think you will not be elected as Governor. These are two big time failures and you have the power to eradicate both. It’s clear that the “No Cash Bail Reform Law” has not prevented recidivism, but in fact has encouraged it and a DA who won’t enforce felony charges is not qualified to be a DA. I will vote on these issues because of the impact it has on the safety of New Yorkers. My decision as to whom I will vote depends, of course, on the field that you will be running against. But if the two things that I have highlighted as the most meaningful issues in New York are not removed, I can only assure you that you will not win the gubernatorial Election. Ron Prager, March 18, 2022 On Affirmative Action Fifty years ago, I could have predicted that affirmative action would become a third rail issue whose prominence today overshadows any notion regarding hiring and educational competency. It is the sheets that racists like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson use to hide behind and squeeze money out of corporations and play act anything resembling legitimacy. It gives license for racists, particularly those in education, to forego qualification in favor of race-based selection. Fifty years ago, I took a community college in Brooklyn, New York before what was then, I believe called, the State Human Rights Commission. The college is now called Brooklyn Technical College; I have forgotten the school’s name at the time. My case was remanded back to the original hearing status because I didn’t have a lawyer. Obviously, I lost the case for lack of good representation and an aggressive approach. I was 20 years old at the time and worked as a mathematics tutor at the College; it foretold the direction we were and now moving. It is the arc in which we now revolve around and pretend that solid qualifications are a quaint notion from another time. We now have a cognitively impaired president and a vice-president neither of whom exude the adjective of “gravitas” – a word which I never heard used to describe either of these two players. We don’t look for qualification or competency anymore, just race and gender. We’ve moved into a world of “identity” politics. No wonder we are stranded in this morass of mediocrity. Affirmative Action is a tripping stone which keeps qualified individuals off the playing fields. I hope that this is talked about until it is rescinded as a self-imposed discriminatory failure. The program has always been a failure with the students who were admitted to colleges in lieu of qualified students, failing out in numbers far exceeding those who were qualified. Don’t let the subject of affirmative action fall back into oblivion. The oft overlooked protection against such discriminatory practices is the 14th Amendment to the US constitution. Below are the types of instances which this amendment has been invoked: … addresses many aspects of citizenship and the rights of citizens. The most commonly used — and frequently litigated — phrase in the amendment is “ equal protection of the laws “, which figures prominently in a wide variety of landmark cases, including Brown v. Board of Education (racial discrimination), Roe v. Wade (reproductive rights), Bush v. Gore (election recounts), Reed v. Reed (gender discrimination), and University of California v. Bakke (racial quotas in education). (Note: emphasis mine) We did not get to this level of incompetency by sheer accident. The other program which paralleled affirmative action was called “wider recruitment” which was supposed to enable people who would not ordinarily be swept into the good graces of better education and more skillful jobs, to not be overlooked for lack of opportunity. Information was supposed to be disseminated beyond the barriers that were holding people back and given opportunities that extended beyond race. You’ve probably never heard of “wider recruitment” because it was never really actualized. Instead, this country has been inundated with hiring ads such as we are an equal opportunity employer, knowing full well that when these proclamations are seen, it is quite the reverse. We have to go back to adhering to the 14th Amendment – equal protection under the law. Quota systems such as I have been subject to, do not follow the 14th Amendment and hiring should revert to hiring the most qualified otherwise we will revert and slide deeper into the mire of racism and mediocrity. End Affirmative Action. It is not “inclusionary” as it was misguidedly supposed to be, but rather “exclusionary” as it has become. Ron Prager, November 7, 2021 Congresswoman Meng, I’ve sent you emails regarding several topics, and I don’t think that I’ve received any answers that I would count as substantive. One: who gave Dr. Fauci the greenlight to funnel money through a third party to the Wuhan Virology Lab? The second: what is the actual protocol for the removal of Biden from office either through the 25 th Amendment or from the lack of cognitive competency that would be expected from the Presidency of the United States? Third: what is the disastrous role he played in his incompetent drawback from Afghanistan ignoring his own Generals recommendations on how to properly proceed? Fourth: what will be the consequences of his incompetent handling of the Southern Border Crisis leaving our border totally open with Covid carrying illegal immigrants, drug shipments and all the mayhem that has accompanied his “Open Border Policy”? Fifth: the long-term consequence of his closing down the Keystone XL pipeline making our Country energy dependent upon foreign countries to fill the gap and capitulating to that dimwit Ocasio Cortez? We’ve gone from debacle to debacle, crisis to crisis and I still don’t know who really is running our government. Could you provide me with some answers before we go into runaway inflation and before Biden’s son is able to send us down the river with corruption and the FBI afraid to broach the Biden corruption issue. Ron Prager, October 24, 2021 Congresswoman Meng, It is not that time is running out; it has run out. Biden clearly is making disastrous decisions. The Afghani people who have worked with us, are going to be killed along with Americans who still remain in Afghanistan. He left the records of Afghani people’s pay stubs, phone numbers and addresses who have been our allies. They will be murdered, hanged or otherwise butchered. All of Biden’s assurances that all is well have been lies and by now I’m sure that you know that. The 25 th Amendment must be invoked. Biden has to be put out to pasture realizing also that Harris is of unknown competency, but it is a chance that we have to take, and unfortunately our only choice. Congresswoman Meng, It is clearly time to remove Joe Biden as President. He is not competent to run this government as seen in this past week; let him have a totally unscripted press conference without pre-selecting neither the questions nor reporters. Have it run for about an hour – no teleprompters nor notes nor photographs of the reporters, and then the American people will have a picture of what they have chosen as their President. I fear that we will all see the mistake that was made, but we must give the American people the chance to see the outrage that was perpetrated upon them. Dear (Texas) Governor Abbott, I’m a long way from Texas, but I have seen you speak on several newscasts about the Border Crisis. Our incompetent president (I use lower case because I don’t recognize his legitimacy) is going from one disaster to another, starting with the XL Pipeline, the Afghanistan debacle to where we are now – an overflow of illegal aliens being transported throughout the United States in clear violation of Biden’s Constitutional Oath of keeping American safe from foreign intrusion. This is not a Nation that can withstand four years of Biden’s (or for that matter, Harris’) destruction. I’m asking that you call out the State’s National Guard to turn back the tide of disastrous policy making that Biden seems to want to adhere to. His motives are unclear: is it deliberate policy or is it his cognitive deficiency that he’s making us all suffer? I don’t pretend to know the answer, but what I do know is the Nation is in great jeopardy. Ron Prager, September 24, 2021 Governor Kathy Hochul, Governor, I’m not hearing any movement in the “No Cash Bail Reform” laws. It should be unequivocally rescinded. This is not party politics; it is sheer madness to not permit judges to perform their sworn duties. We need rational change not radical change and the “No Cash Bail Reform” does not conform to anything but ideological error and non-rationality. Do you plan on trying to rescind “No Cash Bail Reform” laws or are we going to have to vote you out of office for shunning the concerns of honest New Yorkers giving priority to criminals who should have their day in court instead of putting New Yorkers at risk over this insane “No Cash Bail Reform” law? Let the judges make the assessment, not the politicians. This is one of the reasons that Andrew Cuomo was relieved of his office. I would like to hear you speak loudly on this issue.  (This letter will be sent also to my State Senator Joseph Addabbo and State Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi.) Ron Prager, September 19, 2021 Governor Kathy Hochul, Yes, I believe Rikers should temporarily be closed, but it’s inmates should be transferred to other State facilities until new and safer facilities could be built there. I suspect that de Blasio’s main reason for wanting the prison closed is to “sell” development “contracts” to his political allies and friends. That should come as no surprise since his wife garnered $1.25 billion to fund a non-functional program called “ThriveNYC”. The only people thriving are de Blasio and his wife. And please look into this abuse of power and corruption. To: Malliotakis *, Garbarino *, Meng *, Marjorie Taylor Greene no contact, Gillebrand *, Schumer*, Peter King no contact, Borough President Fossella no contact, Adams * and Hochul *: Yes, we all know the outcome of the Trump Persecution trial. Was anyone surprised? As a matter of fact, as soon as Biden “wanted” to have debates, we all should have figured that the “fix” was in. There is one phrase however, that I’ve not heard tossed around: Follow the Money. Now that little Alex Soros was given sole control over Georgy’s fortune and has had the White House doors thrown open to him numerous times and has had access to many unscrupulous, easily bought politicians e.g. Schumer, we could have made some logical assumptions. Corrupt Democrat New York State, City and Federal politicians are now as available as marijuana; the commonality is that they all stink. Let’s take a quick peek at Judge Merchan whose daughter is involved with the Democrat Party. Should we be following the money there? We already know that Fat Alvin Bragg has been bought over, along with many other DA’s from coast to coast. I believe that “Tush” James is in little Alex’s pocket. Little Alex has vowed to be “more political than his father”. How about the Trump jury; are there any possibilities there? Let’s keep an eye on that. Their spending habits should be scrutinized, particularly the lawyers who were part of the jury and whose influence on the jury we know nothing about. There is one devastating link from the Democrat Party that may connect up many of these awful “Bidenesque” schemes to what we saw play out this week: Little Alex Soros has been dating Huma Abiden who is Hillary Clinton’s top aide. Do you think perhaps Hillary is acting as Little Alex’s guiding hand and rearranging the chess board for Little Alex? Very scary prospect. Ron Prager, May 31, 2024 We have a president, Joe Biden, who really has no significance on the world stage. As his predecessor Obama did, helped fund the Islamist terror country, Iran. Now we have a situation where this mentally incompetent man is doing likewise: withholding needed war materials from Israel even though Congress has approved the funding for “Ukraine, Israel, and other U.S. allies”. Let’s look back into the history of why Michigan is a “battle field” state for the Biden presidency. It begins with Henry Ford, a man who hated Jews. He did not want to bring Jewish labor to work in his factories, but instead brought in Arab workers. That’s where we get the immigration of Omar and Tlaib and the many Jew haters in this region. These are only some of the roots of Jewish hatred. This hatred has existed “under cover of darkness” in the U.S. for many years with the German Bund hiding in plain sight during WWII. Think of the Nazi Bund in Yaphank, Long Island. Now, when Israel faces the necessity of removing Hamas, using its humanity, warning Rafah citizens, hoping to minimize the collateral deaths in Rafah where the last battalions of its mortal enemy Hamas still exist, Biden reneges on his willingness to provide Israel with the armaments that it needs to finish the war and recover the hostages, if any are still alive. Give Israel the armaments that it needs. It’s already funded and bilaterally agreed upon. I think we are getting a larger picture of Biden Ron Prager, May 9, 2024 Dear Bill O’Reilly , I don’t know if you realize this, but Soros’ real name is Schwartz and grandpa’ Soros changed it to Soros when the Nazis occupied Hungary ostensibly to try to protect his family from extermination. Grandpa’ Soros was also a member of the local Judenrat, the Council of Jews who probably were instrumental in revealing the hiding places of other Jews. That’s speculation but what isn’t speculation is that little Alex Soros promised that he would be more political than Georgy. We are seeing this playing out with little Alex being invited to the White House numerous times for nothing “more heinous” than meeting with that whore Chuck Schumer as well the brain trust of Kamala Harris. Other politicos were given massive sums of money; Alvin Bragg and a host of other no-cash-bail DA’s among them. Little Alex following in his father’s footsteps, seems bent on destroying the United States. I’m saving the best for last: little Alex is dating Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin. What can you make of this little piece of intrigue? Scares the hell out of me. Ron Prager, May 1, 2024 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, It’s time to recognize your failure as the President of Columbia. There should not be any Jew haters on your campus and their masks should be removed to expose the faces of hatred. If you’re too cowardly to call in the NYPD to remove these Jew haters as Speaker Johnson recommended, resign and restore order to Columbia. Israel will soon move to expunge Hamas from this world. If you’re too ignorant to understand the consequences of the Holocaust which it seems that you are, step down. You do not have authority anymore and you fail to understand the lessons of history. Never again! Ron Prager, April 30, 2024 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, Columbia University, under your presidency, has become a hotbed of Jew Hatred. Some of your finances probably come from an anti-Semitic Jew by the name of Alex Soros. Yes, the Soros’ real name was Schwartz. Grandpa Soros changed the family surname to Soros when the Nazis invaded Hungary and he was given certain privileges as a member of the local Judenrat, probably giving out the hiding places of other Jews. I believe you should educate your students (and the on-campus radical troublemakers) as to why Israel exists. Israel has been the home of the Jewish people for thousands of years. And you should explain to these ignorant protestors why the surrounding Islamic countries don’t want them. Columbia has demonstrated the need for Israel and the protection of Jews within the confines of your intolerant university. Never Again! Ron Prager, April 29, 2024 Something very interesting to note: it explains a lot that Hillary Clinton’s assistant Huma Abedin, who is dating someone who might be behind no-cash-bail DA’s and the anti-Israel riots on college campuses, the young Alex Soros who promised to be more political than his bastard father. This might explain the cash transfers via the Soros Foundations and its “subsidiaries” or offshoots such as the Tides Foundation or the Working Families Party. There’s a lot of Soros money floating around whether it be given to that weasel, Chuck Schumer or even funding the Clinton Foundation, DA Bragg or “Tush” James, maybe California DA’s or even that incompetent Gavin Newsom who has let his state fall into massive disrepair with cravings for the US Presidency. Just an ironic note: George Soros’ father changed the family name from Schwartz to Soros during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The family really are self-proclaimed Jewish anti-Semites. I wonder how many Jews did the Soros grandfather put in mortal jeopardy when he was a member of the local Judenrat, the council of Jews who knew the hiding places of many Hungarian Jews. Don’t expect to find any integrity among the Soros family. Ron Prager, April 27, 2024 Senator Schumer, Give back the money that little Alex Soros has bribed you with and perhaps donate it to Pro-Israeli causes so that Israel is able to build more bomb shelters and feed its displaced Northern Israeli citizens, and defend the integrity of its Country. It takes balls, Senator, to slap the faces of these Neo-Nazis that are wreaking havoc on college campuses and I’m glad that Speaker Johnson demonstrated this in front of the Nation. He knew instinctively what to do. Ron Prager, April 25, 2024 Brian Kilmeade , Perhaps you should report contributions given to many of our stellar politicians such as Chucky Schumer, Harris and many others given by Alex Soros, an anti-Semitic Jew whose grandfather changed their names from Schwartz to Soros during the Nazi overthrow of the Hungarian government. I have the horrible feeling that little Alex is helping to fund this horrible pro-hamas movement that we see on college campuses and paying off politicians such as Bragg and Willis to persecute Pres. Trump. I do hope that you look into this because I suspect that’s where the smell is emanating from. It’s no coincidence that all of the “tents” set up on these campuses look as if they’re all purchased from the same source. Follow the money. Ron Prager, April 24, 2024 Governor Kathy Hochul, It has always been a precept of law, with the exception of the Covid crisis, that a person’s face should be uncovered, not wearing masks that hide a person’s facial features. Covid is over and people should be arrested for hiding their faces. It is clear that those anti-Semitic protesters should be held accountable for their actions and not hide behind masks or pro-Hamas scarfs. Do your job and let the police do theirs. I think we should be allowed to know who these Jew haters are and let these college presidents stop making excuses for this Jew hatred. And also begin teaching what the Nazi concentration camps did during WWII. I’m beginning to believe that these “ignorant” college protestors do not have the slightest idea why there is a country like Israel. Ron Prager, April 23, 2024 Senator Schumer, I think that a truly brave person like yourself should intercede and speak at these pro-hamas rallies, and attempt to explain the Nazi Holocaust to these protesters. You might be able to explain the concentration camps where millions of Jews were tortured and murdered by these anti-Semitic Nazi monsters. These “college” students should not go through life in the ignorance that they are demonstrating. A brave U.S. Senator, such as yourself, should be able to explain that these Israelites are the survivors and progeny of the Nazi Holocaust. I’m sure a brave person, such as yourself with such laudable standing in this Government, should without hesitation, speak before these demonstrators and be able to make them understand that Israel for Jews, is the only One-State solution. I hope that you’ve noticed that none of the Arab countries want these so called “Palestinians”, countries that occupy massive land areas–there surely is a reason for that. As a Jew you should stand up for that and not attempt to interfere with Israeli elections. During wartime, which Israel is in, your voice should not be suggesting that Netanyahu should be replaced. Perhaps you should be questioning the mental competency of Joe Biden and ask that he should step down. It’s become very obvious that Joe is compromising our Country. Ron Prager, April 21, 2024 Senator Charles Schumer, It seems like the appropriate time to return the money given to you by the anti-Semitic Jew, Alex Soros and explain to your constituency how his large bribe has influenced your judgement, particularly in your anti-Israel stance. I’m personally ashamed of you and all the others caught up in this large bribery scheme initiated by the Soros family. Morality should speak louder than cash and you should know by now that the Soros family are committed to the destruction of the United States. Ron Prager, April 16, 2024 Peter King, On the destruction of safety and democracy by Alex Soros, following in his father’s footsteps only worse: Alex Soros is continuing on the course of destroying the United States by his unabashed large contributions to DA’s such as Bragg and Heasty with the goal of releasing hardened criminals into our streets. The contributions extend beyond DA’s to Senators like Schumer, and House and Senate Democrat Superpacs. I think that it’s time to find out, in front of Congress, Alex’s true gameplan. Alex has had seventeen invitations to the White House where such people as Harris, Pelosi, as though she needs the money, and others grovel for their war chests. Do you think that you might be able to spur the investigations into what young Alex has in mind for the “future” of our Country? Ron Prager, April 3, 2024 Borough President Fossella, Listening to the John Catsimatidis program this morning, you made reference to Carl Heasty in a positive light. I think that you should rethink that and realize that Heasty has been paid by Alex Soros. Without first verifying the Soros connection, I knew that money flowed to Heasty via Soros. I then confirmed that point and question why Heasty is following the No-Cash-Bail philosophy that the Soros family is promulgating. At this point, knowing that there are many DA’s and politicians being (undermined), paid off by the Soros family, the question is who and why Soros is trying to destroy this Country with his Open Society Foundation. At first glance, the Open Society Foundation “appears to be doing honorable work” but if you will notice, the reason Officer Diller was murdered is partially because of the corruption and deceit of the Soros family. It defies logic to not incarcerate the criminal elements that are not in jail as they should be. I believe that it’s time for the investigation into the Soros’ family motives as well as preparing yourself for the depths of the Soros family societal destruction. This tree of pay-offs goes to very deep depths of our political levels including the likes of Schumer, to the brainless Vice-President Harris, to DA Bragg, California’s DA George Gascon, and many more. You can view some of the Soros “influenced” politicians on the internet and you will be surprised by how many visits to the White House, young Alex Soros has made. Time to find out why the Soros family is wreaking havoc on the USA. Ron Prager, March 31, 2024 Annelle Sheline, It seems to be very easy to forget that Hamas is using the Gazans as human shields and that Hamas has squandered aid money that was meant for Gazans, building a massive and expensive tunnel network beneath Gaza with the eventual aim of destroying Israel. When Israelis are slaughtered, you do not speak of the Gazans’ inhumanity of their atrocities. Israelis have taken the most care of any nation to minimize collateral damage to Gazans and you’re relying upon Hamas run “health ministry’s” numbers. You should be concerned about the propaganda value of these numbers. Do you really think that if given the opportunity to slaughter Israelis, Hamas would take care not to murder innocents? Their actions have already affirmed that and according to Hamas there are no Jews to be spared. Your resignation from the human rights department of our failing Biden government is really a welcome decision for the people who want to see Hamas extinguished from mankind. The less apologists for Hamas, the more we can see a humane outcome to the war that Hamas began. Ron Prager, March 30, 2024 Mayor Adams and Gov. Hochul, We don’t need high-tech machines to keep the subways safe. We need a commitment to incarcerate and institutionalize those who make this City and subway as unsafe as it has become. As long as we have a government bribed and coerced by money from the likes of Soros and we don’t put in the necessary impediments to the destruction of society, we are going to have the carnage and mayhem that we are now seeing. It’s an obvious consequence when we have Braggs and Heasties as well as “other” misguided social “justice” warriors making policy that no rational society can endure. Mr. Mayor, you made the horrible mistake of declaring this a sanctuary city and Ms. Governor you made the horrible mistake of not ridding New York of the Soros infestation. I know a lot of politicians are licking the soles of Alex Soros boots including our “esteemed” Senators Schumer and Pelosi (why she needs the money leaves me dumbfounded). This has to stop. High-tech machines are no match for courage in our Political infrastructure. Ron Prager, March 29, 2024 How did we wind up with terrorist attacks in Israel? This is not unexpected. First, we had an “ex” president who wanted the destruction of Israel: why else would he have given a pallet full of cash to Iran? Was Iran our “friend” throughout this? Wasn’t Iranians chanting death to the big Devil, the U.S. and death to the little Devil, Israel? Obama knew this and Obama’s puppet, Joe Biden knew this as well. The Obama puppet, Joe Biden does not have the courage to stand up to anybody. Ol’ Scranton Joe has been weak on everything. He didn’t mention the origins of Covid to Xi, or the fentanyl  deaths in the U.S. to Xi either. We have a coward and crook in the White House fronting for his son and bagman, Hunter. And now when Israel needs us as a partner, what does Joe do but weasel out of what once was a solid commitment to Israel. I personally believe in a one state solution – Israel. If the Arab population wants to stay in Israel, they should do so. Why do you suppose that none of the Arab states want them? They are a problem and the Arab states know this too well. Hamas has to be exterminated and Biden does not have the balls or comprehension of the reality to understand this. Ron Prager, December 6, 2023 Senator Charles Schumer, As a Jew, I’m beginning to see the awakenings of a contemporary Nazi movement in the United States. We both see something called a “Pro-Palestinian Movement” here in our Country; bluntly, we are finding out who the real Jew haters are. Some of the most vocal Jew haters have a sounding board for their vitriol, and they are in Congress denying that Jews have a right to defend themselves. Many Jew haters are also in what is supposed to be institutions of higher learning, and the good thing is that some of their benefactors have stopped providing them funding. Are there Pro-Palestinian countries in the Middle East funding some of these colleges like “U of P” and Columbia? I would like to see the colleges and universities who have promoted this neo-Nazi movement denied Federal funding and I would like to see a commission formed to investigate these educational institutions. The promulgation of Jews not having the right to defend themselves is an intolerable concept. It would be comforting to think that Biden’s Middle East visit was highly successful, but it seems that most likely it was a continuation of the Obama appeasement of Iran policy. Didn’t Obama sneak a pallet laden with cash out to Iran? And didn’t Biden’s “exchange” of hostages for a release to Iran of $6 billion, $1 billion per hostage? A real and decisive energy policy would ameliorate that type of nihilism that this Nation is experiencing being fomented by climate change hysteria. We are not producing oil and gas, but rather purchasing them from dictatorships like Iran, Venezuela and Russia and at the same time depleting our emergency oil reserve, which it looks like we are in great need of refilling. This green energy “program” is a fraud – consider how much energy is needed to build and maintain a wind farm. At what point will a wind turbine be fully amortized? “Green Energy” is a nice thought but we’re not ready for it as of now. And if you’ve been paying attention to the news, which I’m sure you have, don’t most political pundits agree that Obama is running the Government? Biden is not capable of doing so and nobody wants Harris making policy. Buying up Iranian oil is subsidizing Iran’s proxy war against Israel. Ron Prager, October 24, 2023 Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, There seems to be some very warranted concerns regarding 5G cell phone transponders above and near living quarters in this neighborhood. I don’t think that this is a “henny penny” reaction having already seen some clear and documented medical problems associated with 5G and I think that there should be a moratorium on 5G tower installation until we understand the validity of these concerns. Do you think that shielding should be provided to tenants of these building to mitigate these concerns? I think that this may prove to be a compelling concern, now and in the future. What are your thoughts on this Assemblyman Hevesi? (The recommended “safe” distance from these 5G towers is 50 meters. I suspect this may be a very conservative estimate from “communications industry assessments”.) Ron Prager, July 22, 2023 John B. King, Jr. is the 15th Chancellor of the State University of New York (SUNY) Chancellor King, I’ve been fighting “affirmative action” for nearly 50 years hoping that merit prevails over race. I took the Community College of Brooklyn (I believe it is now called the New York Technical College) before the State’s Human Right Commission for racial discrimination in about 1970. Affirmative Action was wrong then and it is wrong now. I am glad Asian people understood that merit should prevail over race. I had already graduated Brooklyn College before a policy of open enrollment at Brooklyn College was enacted; it proved absolutely devastating for academics. My personal feeling is that students who show potential merit, should be given the opportunity to hone their reading and math skills in “post high school programs” in either after school classes with booster programs to give poor performing students a second chance or post-high school classes emphasizing academics to bring them up to speed. If you don’t recall, “affirmative action” students failed out of Brooklyn College at extraordinarily high rates after that policy was enacted. The other side of this State’s shortcomings is that Gov. Hochul has failed to recognize that legalizing marijuana usage may have a devastating effect on academics, and this State’s Government failed to research short and long term effects of marijuana. Their tax plan does not seem to be working out too well either – street selling will probably thrive over Hochul’s plan. Rethink your plan Chancellor King. The Supreme Court’s decision will finally have long reaching and positive consequences. Ron Prager, July 4, 2023 Senator Schumer, I was delighted to see your photograph with Alex Soros. It gives me the sense of probably who is now pocketing the Soros money. Remember that Georgy Soros’ name was Schwartz before his father changed it to protect his family from the Nazis – ironically, the family is Anti-Semitic. I know that Georgy’s father was also a member of the local Judenrat, the Jewish council that made it easier for one Jew to betray another in return for some sort of concession and make the Holocaust an easier task for the Nazis to accomplish. That is possibly how Anne Frank’s family was discovered. You, Mr. Schumer, are collecting the same payoffs that the Soros DA’s are receiving and I’m glad that I was able to see you, among several other prominent Democrat politicians including the incredibly incompetent V.P. Harris, and you with a shit-eating grin, aiding the hell bent Soros’ destruction of America. What you will do for money and power! We already know about Biden and his lust for money and how he will sell America down the river along with his crack smoking son. We now have an extremely compromised president who doesn’t give a damn about our Country and you know this already and it seems that you’re willing to jump into bed with this quisling. As far as the Soros family, this is one Jewish Hungarian family that I’m sorry that the Nazis didn’t put in Auschwitz. Our Country would have been better for it. cc:  Andrew Garbarino, Grace Meng, Kirstin Gillibrand, Kathy Hochul, Simcha Felder, Andrew Hevesi Ron Prager, June 15, 2023 Ms. Hochul, I didn’t realize just how incompetent you really are. You’re really out of touch with how U.S. citizens feel about illegal immigration and what the disastrous consequences will have on life here. This seems to be the time to acknowledge the disaster that an incompetent and compromised president will sow. We all saw it in play with the Chinese Communist Party’s spy balloon over our missile silos and strategic defense commands. This wasn’t a happenstance. This is what we get when a U.S. president is on the take. Better take a larger look at the disaster of the illegal alien crisis. And please read the following: Mr. Mayor, It looks like you got sucker punched from all directions. There is a clear and objective distinction between “asylum seekers” and “migrants”. We’ve had “migrant” worker programs for years. They had to come through the border legally, but the people who are seeking asylum had to show a clear legitimacy to their and their family’s safety. You welcomed everyone coming across our Southern Border with no thought of consequences to this State’s (and other states’) welfare and economies. Your lack of anticipation of the consequences to this City’s livability is unconscionable. Did you give a thought to the educational system? The hospital system? To the homeless and mentally ill crisis that we are experiencing? The criminal crisis under the failing stewardship of Soros’ lacky Bragg? Your heart might have been in the right place but your planning and practicality has been a total failure. What we are now experiencing is the predictable and deliberate destruction of the United States by a mentally incompetent president and an administration that is replete with failures. Ron Prager, May 23, 2023 Dear Governor, I’m been very amused by thinking that the Hero Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes would have risen to the occasion when the NYC subway train was invaded by a lunatic. Remember that she hid in a bathroom during the January 6 th incursion on the Capital? I’m sure she would have risen to the forefront of that subway car and subdued that madman who had over 40 priors and an outstanding warrant against him. Yes, bravery would have shone on her face. The reality is that she probably would have shit in her pants in such a confrontation. She also aligned herself with the anti-white racists in calling for the heroic Marine, who is white, to be jailed. This man is a hero and should not be subjected to any grand jury investigation. Mayor Adams gets it. I think we all know the real criminal – Alvin Bragg for not either institutionalizing or imprisoning this mentally ill person. The crimes that this man committed included some violent crimes. Lee Zeldin would have ridded this City of the Bragg Blight immediately. I think that’s what you should be doing and vindicate this Marine hero. Mayor Adams, If these “phony” activists were so outraged after the death of that subway lunatic, why didn’t any of them offer to help him before he died? I think that Marine should be considered a hero after subduing a man who threatened an entire subway car and also having over 40 priors and a current arrest warrant. Do you really believe that this moron Alvin Bragg should remain in office? He’s really the man who should be charged with murder for his failure to provide help for a clearly disturbed man. It is a sad case and one that could have been avoided if these phony “activists” were really seeking to help him. I don’t really think that any of them had the guts to get involved, and the Marine should be thanked for his braveness and actions. Governor Hochul, Stop with the drama. This was a potentially dangerous man who should have received help after more than 40 priors. If that race baiter, Sharpton could have helped why didn’t he? You know the answer that the man is erratic and should have been committed to an asylum a long time ago. He might have been helped, certainly if Bragg was really concerned. And you should not have been in contact with Sharpton. He has a rather infamous and corrupt past. Think what the passengers on that F train experienced, put yourself in their places and I think that you can forget the histrionics. The Marine was a hero and thank God that he was on the train at that time. Ron Prager, May 6, 2023 Congresswoman Meng, At what point are we, as a nation, going to actually view Biden as cognitively impaired? Isn’t it time for this “president” to hold a news conference that is not pre-orchestrated, where Joe is going to show that he can think on his feet? Announcing that he is running for Presidency on videotape just reminds me of his “rat hole” campaign that he did last time. The Nation is at stake. Everything Joe has done has failed, from his cutting off the Keystone XL pipeline to his exit strategy from Afghanistan to his selection of the most incompetent Cabinet in our history – where is this going to end? His blaming of President Trump for all these failures is growing thin; Karine Jean-Pierre is clearly out of her league, overusing the term “clearly” which is opaque as she is able to get. I’m sure by now that Biden’s abject failures and corruption have become very obvious. His keeping of a Chinese Communist Party’s spy balloon aloft for days, until it completed its mission has put this Nation under a very compromised situation. His failure to provide Taiwan with armaments while promising the needed supplies is going to lead to very poorly thought-out consequences. Get this compromised president out front of an array of independent journalists and let’s hear what he is able to say. I fear that he is only capable of talking about chocolate chip ice cream and will melt under any substantive discussion of foreign affairs. Ron Prager, April 26, 2023 Mr. Mayor, I sincerely hope that you did not anticipate the consequence of opening up New York City as a sanctuary city. It would have been foolhardy to suggest that you did not foresee that all social services would have been overwhelmed by this illegal alien crisis, and you are absolutely correct in asking help from the Washington government who actually promoted the “come on over” agenda. We have a compromised President, an incompetent Vice-President and a pathetic liar as Secretary of Homeland Security, Mayorkas who likes to pretend that the Southern border is “closed”. Your clearer course, Mr. Mayor, is to isolate the illegals and begin doing background checks and deportations of this mess that Washington created. I think that you’re beginning to see the truth of where things stand. Ron Prager, March 7, 2023 Senator Gillibrand, It’s wonderful that you have secured money for New York State’s infrastructure, but it is incumbent upon you to study the actual expenditures. We have the most corrupt government in my lifetime starting at the top with Biden. And also, the least competent Vice-President and Cabinet that I’ve ever seen, chosen by race, gender, homosexuality while actually omitting competency as a criteria for the position. I suggest that careful attention is paid towards the granting of contracts and a complete list is made available for the public to see. Ron Prager, March 3, 2023 Rita Cosby (WABC-AM), A poignant moment in my recall is when the bodies of U.S. servicemen were off-loaded from a plane after the Afghanistan debacle, and Joe was busy checking his watch. I think we all know by now who Biden’s paymaster is. This is an area that’s been skirted around and I think we have to take a harsh look at Joe Biden. He is not in the impeachment arena anymore. It’s much more unsettling. Joe, Hunter and Jim should all be perceived as possibly serving as traitors to our Country–for large amounts of money. Why was that spy balloon not taken out immediately? It was able to surveille all our nuclear silos and strategic air force sites from one end of the country to the other. Do you really believe that Joe was concerned if the debris from the balloon fell on Americans? It could have been safely downed over some of the least populated parts of our Country. Again, how was Joe Biden able to afford the properties that he has on a Senator’s salary? At some point soon, I would hope that you would spend some significant time on your program examining the events that bring to light Biden et al. treasonous behavior. It pains me to think that we really have a traitor-in-chief. Ron Prager, February 18, 2023 Congresswomen Meng and Malliotakis, and Congressman Garbarino, There apparently is one thing that George Santos did not lie about: our current President does not have any integrity either. This was the one thing that Tulsi Gabbard fired at the prevaricator Santos, a man who seems to think that he is just embellishing upon his very obvious fabrications. But he did point out that the man holding power in the White House with his folksy lies and obfuscations of the truth, is not held to the same standard of integrity. And in Joe Biden’s case, is not acting upon or solving the very disasters that he is causing in our Country. Through his drug-addled son, Joe has been receiving millions of dollars from Ukraine, Russia and China, a very compromised position for a U.S. President to be in. Old folksy Joe has landed us in an illegal alien crisis, an energy crisis, an inflation debacle, and a crisis in pretty much anything he has put his inept paws on. I believe Santos should not be seated, I also believe that Old Folksy Joe should step down or be impeached for the same lack of integrity that George Santos and he have both created for themselves. Ron Prager, December 30, 2022 VIA EMAIL: NYSAG@ag.ny.gov, Letitia.james@ag.ny.gov December 21, 2022 Ms. Letitia James New York State Attorney General Office of the Attorney General The Capitol Albany, NY 12224-0341 Re: Letter to NYS Legislature on Election Integrity Petition Filed by Queens County Republican Patriots in 2021 Dear Attorney General Letitia James: Attached please find a letter addressed to the New York State Legislature by 12 Queens County Committee Members on December 11, 2022 to inquire about the status of the Election Integrity Petition dated October 26, 2021, which was forwarded to the New York State Legislature by the Queens County Republican Patriots (“QCRP”) on or about October 27, 2021 via email and certified mail. (See attached signed letter). We are including a scanned copy of the QCRP petition letter for your perusal. (See attached petition letter, without signatures). We are looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. We would greatly appreciate acknowledgement that you have received our letter and its attachments. With a spirit to serve as Queens County Committee Members, Aura Moody (33 AD, 50 ED) Joseph Concannon (33 AD, 9 ED) Elena Chin (24AD, 62 ED) James Coppola (AD 24, ED 62) Laura M.

Chronowitz (AD 26, ED 21) Ira Harris (AD 24, ED 56) Ira Chazan (24 AD, 58 ED) Response from the NYS Attorney General to Complaint Filed Against the NYS Legislature by QCRP on Election Integrity Petition dated 1-10-2023 Congresswoman Meng, It should be very clear by now that we have an immensely incompetent administration. To trade a second-rate basketball player for a very dangerous and active arms dealer? Leaving behind an American ex-marine, Paul Whelan in this lopsided prisoner exchange? Everything that Biden has done has been a disaster; from the shutting down of the XL Pipeline, the Afghanistan debacle, his son’s dealing with Burisma, China and Russia, Biden’s constant lying about his own achievements, his selection of an incompetent Vice-President, his open border policy, the money that has been forked over to him by his son – we have a very compromised President. His selection of lightweights in such positions as Secretary of State and Secretary of Transportation who have no “gravitas”, a word that we do not hear at all about Biden’s cabinet. A Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, who has lied under oath to Congress saying that the “border is secure” while having massive security risks streaming over the border. Unless you speak up, I will not vote Democrat anymore – even if I like your work. At stake is the integrity of this Country and having a President who lacks integrity contributes to the unease and destabilization of our Country. Ron Prager, December 12, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, It seems that DA James received a large amount of her “donations” from the Tides Foundation which is related to George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. It is funneled through the Working Families Party and should be pointed out and highlighted that it is the same source as Alvin Bragg’s contributions are coming from. Little wonder that “Tush” James is on the no-cash bail express. It also explains why the same smell emanates from Ms. James as from Soros and Bragg. Could you please look further into this. Soros’ goal appears to be the destruction of our Country along with some other Democrats. This seems strange considering that Soros’ father changed his name from Schwartz to Soros to evade the Nazis, and our Country seems to be on a fascist, anti-Semitic path. Ron Prager, November 25, 2022 Mr. Mayor, It’s bad enough that you’re not up to the job as mayor, but since when is our First Amendment Right been abridged? How are you going to define “hateful speech” without screwing with the First Amendment? Why are you not pointing your finger towards the idiots who left our borders wide open? You’re pretty silent about where to place the blame for the illegal alien disaster. Ron Prager, October 10, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, I think it should be clear by now that Biden is a complete and dangerous failure. We’re now poised to expect a PRC invasion of Taiwan. The question is when and we should expect it during the Biden administration because he’s recognized as being a very weak leader. Everything he’s done, so far, has been a failure. He is busy blaming President Trump for everything that divides this country but he won’t look to himself: from his taking large bribes from China, Russia and the Ukraine via his son and all of our many crises that didn’t occur before him. Biden is a tainted and compromised political hack. When I vote, I typically split the ticket but after seeing how incompetent Biden is – think Afghanistan, XL Pipeline, open borders, his phony inflation reduction plan, and remember when the bodies of American soldiers were being taken off the plane and Joe was busy looking at his watch? This time I’m voting straight down the line Republican. This Country will be in shambles by the time Joe leaves office. I wish I was joking and I think you can see that for yourself. I sometimes ask myself “who is steering the ship”? I don’t think that Biden even knows where the ship is; my guess is that it’s probably called Obama, Rice and Hillary. We’re heading for an iceberg. Ron Prager, September 3, 2022 Mayor Adams, What a wonderful idea of having a “hip hop” museum in the Bronx – no crime there. Just a pleasant place to live or get shot, knifed or get beaten. I did notice that not too many white people were shown in your celebration photograph. How much of that money came from private contributors and how much of that came from such stellar organizations like Black Lives Matter ? Why wasn’t that same money used to fund educational institutions and programs? I don’t think “hip hop” is what I would consider “culture” unless you wore your pants below your waist exposing your underwear. Perhaps the idea is to have non-literate Black teenagers blaring out that crap instead of staying home and studying or dare I say, studying at libraries? And I didn’t recall seeing or hearing about an assessment of the effects of marijuana which seems to have higher frequencies of use in Black neighborhoods and the negative consequences of marijuana use doesn’t seems to have been taken into account. Why isn’t money spent on countering drug use, unless of course you want the tax revenue to help fund “hip hop” museums? Don’t waste the taxpayer’s money on trash and put together some real anti-crime programs. You really seem to be failing big time. Ron Prager, August 5, 2022 Dear Governor Hochul, I’ve seen that you have taken $20,000 from the Soros family. (Haven’t had a chance yet to view his shell companies contributions to you.) This might explain your reluctance to remove DA Bragg because you might be in the same game as he is on the no-cash-bail money train. You had the opportunity to remove Bragg after the subway shooting, but you didn’t. That would have been your last chance for election. It is bad enough that you’re pushing for that football stadium in Buffalo with taxpayers money. You’re probably a nice person, but corruption is plaguing our State and it seems that you’re in on it. Ron Prager, May 20, 2022 Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, George Soros’ Open Society Foundation appears to be a “misconstruction” of democracy and should be scrutinized very carefully. Here in New York, we are confronted by an ideology that seems bizarre at its least, and severely detrimental at its worst. It seems that the “open” in open society seems to be hell bent on opening prison gates to our worst offenders without considering the dangerousness of the persons who are let go without detentive incarceration. Soros is paying off DA’s to promulgate his own sick ideology and these include Manhattan DA Bragg and $20,000 “contributed” towards Attorney General Letitia James’ campaign fund. I’ve yet to scrutinize Soros’ shell companies and his own family’s contributions to Bragg and James, but it seems like our justice system has been tainted by BIG money. We are not voting for candidates anymore but puppets on strings. These people have to be called out (as many that I’ve not researched as of yet) for endangering the safety of our society. Consider the removals of James and Bragg. I realize our Governor does not have the courage to do so, and may yet be caught up in her own financial scandals revolving around a Buffalo football stadium and her own husband’s connection with it. Ron Prager, May 17, 2022 DA Letitia James, It has come to my attention that you are a proponent of “cash bail reform” thereby letting criminals back into the streets without any cash bail. It has also come to my attention that George Soros donated to you $20,000 ostensibly to promulgate his anti-American programs (along with the likes of Alvin Bragg who should have been relieved of his position by our cowardly Governor). I have not investigated if you’ve received any payment by Soros’ shell companies, but that will be looked into further. What I suggest that you do is either return Communist Soros’ funds or resign from your position. You should make a full disclosure of your “contributors”. Ron Prager, May 16, 2022 John Catsimatidis, I just hate to write a “Dear John” letter, but you had better look more carefully into the doings of yourself and some of your employees. George Soros contributed, from what I can find so far, $20,000 to the campaign of Letitia James, our esteemed DA. If you’ve noticed she has suddenly come out for “Bail reform – no cash bail”. I suspected such a link, and you didn’t check into her more thoroughly and gave her $41,000 according to an article in the NY Post. You will find confirmation of the Soros connection attached to this note. I’ve listened to your programs quite frequently and have been very impressed with Rita Cosby and James Golden. Overall, I like you but please be more careful where your money goes. You could have figured out Ms. James’ political stance a long time ago. Ron Prager, May 14, 2022 Mayor Adams, It’s time for you to step up to the plate or step down. Your handling of the crime problem is abominable. You put virtual targets on the backs of your anti-crime units and it seems that the only thing that you’ve done since you took office is try to make the cover of GQ magazine. Restore Stop-Question and Frisk! Don’t you think that requesting to address the State Assembly regarding and rescinding this idiotic no cash bail policy should be a priority for you? Don’t you think have a heart-to-heart meeting with Hochul and focus on the removal of Alvin Bragg as well as forbidding future nominees to the position of Borough DA from accepting money from shell organizations or directly from the Communist George Soros who seems bent on destroying the United States? Don’t you think that qualified indemnity should be restored to the Police force? Again, step up or step down. We did not elect another de Blasio. Ron Prager, May 9, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, It should be very clear by now that Biden is having severe cognitive difficulties, so much so that he must be immediately removed from office under the 25 th Amendment statute. It leaves the unfortunate circumstance of his replacement by a woman who is clearly not up to the job. Harris has demonstrated her lack of competency already and her foreign and domestic excursions have been what I would call an embarrassment. She has to be removed first before Biden is removed. A horrible gaff has been committed by Biden which has not been spoken of as yet: telegraphing his intentions of what the Country will do as far as arming Ukraine. That should be handled quietly and discretely – sub-rosa. This might provide justification by Russia to use its nuclear capability as a retribution for our “direct involvement” and fodder by Putin to direct blame to the U.S. for our killing of this brutal Russian military. Biden should keep quiet and just do what needs to be done without any fanfare.In addition, we need a plan to repatriate illegal aliens to their home countries. Severe sanctions on hiring should, at least, be the first step. We need a deterrence for the illegals to understand that we have a fair immigration policy and its abuse will not be tolerated. Finally, Biden and Psaki’s parroting that inflation is because of Putin’s war, and that it is a “temporary” state of affairs: How stupid does this regime think that the American people are? Ron Prager, April 24, 2022 Congresswoman Meng, The clock has almost run out. At this point it seems imperative to get Ukraine the armaments that it desperately needs. It’s clear that Biden is compromised mentally and is politically compromised with his son’s dealings with China, Ukraine and Russia. Biden is not capable of acting in the best interests of the United States; he probably wasn’t ever. He needs to be removed from office and pity us if Harris assumes Presidency, but there is no choice and there is no time. Once the Russian troops start moving under the command of General Dvornikov, we cannot be assured that chemical or tactical nuclear weaponry won’t be used. We know that Biden is slow to act and every time he is left to his own words, we really don’t know if his stupidity or cognitive failures won’t initiate WWIII. Please start the invocation of the 25 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and get the weaponry to the Ukraine without Biden telegraphing our intentions. And please try to rally members of Congress to take action. This must defy and be above political affiliations. Ron Prager, April 24, 2022 Governor Hochul, I am glad that you spoke out on the “No Cash Bail Reform” policy, now it seems equally important to remove DA Bragg from his position. My preference is that you haul him out by his ear, but any way you chose to oust him, is fine with me. Also, having the “Anti-Crime” unit so visibly identifiable looks like it might physically endanger the police working in that unit. Plainclothes seems like the more workable solution for getting guns off the streets. I hope that you agree with me on that. Ron Prager, March 22, 2022 Unanswered question on why congress repealed the stretch provision Arthur Teiler 33-24 91 Street Apt 4W Jackson Heights, NY 11372 March 21, 2022 Governor Hochul, If you fail to rescind the “No Cash Bail Reform Law” and fail to remove DA Alvin Bragg from his position, I think you will not be elected as Governor. These are two big time failures and you have the power to eradicate both. It’s clear that the “No Cash Bail Reform Law” has not prevented recidivism, but in fact has encouraged it and a DA who won’t enforce felony charges is not qualified to be a DA. I will vote on these issues because of the impact it has on the safety of New Yorkers. My decision as to whom I will vote depends, of course, on the field that you will be running against. But if the two things that I have highlighted as the most meaningful issues in New York are not removed, I can only assure you that you will not win the gubernatorial Election. Ron Prager, March 18, 2022 On Affirmative Action Fifty years ago, I could have predicted that affirmative action would become a third rail issue whose prominence today overshadows any notion regarding hiring and educational competency. It is the sheets that racists like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson use to hide behind and squeeze money out of corporations and play act anything resembling legitimacy. It gives license for racists, particularly those in education, to forego qualification in favor of race-based selection. Fifty years ago, I took a community college in Brooklyn, New York before what was then, I believe called, the State Human Rights Commission. The college is now called Brooklyn Technical College; I have forgotten the school’s name at the time. My case was remanded back to the original hearing status because I didn’t have a lawyer. Obviously, I lost the case for lack of good representation and an aggressive approach. I was 20 years old at the time and worked as a mathematics tutor at the College; it foretold the direction we were and now moving. It is the arc in which we now revolve around and pretend that solid qualifications are a quaint notion from another time. We now have a cognitively impaired president and a vice-president neither of whom exude the adjective of “gravitas” – a word which I never heard used to describe either of these two players. We don’t look for qualification or competency anymore, just race and gender. We’ve moved into a world of “identity” politics. No wonder we are stranded in this morass of mediocrity. Affirmative Action is a tripping stone which keeps qualified individuals off the playing fields. I hope that this is talked about until it is rescinded as a self-imposed discriminatory failure. The program has always been a failure with the students who were admitted to colleges in lieu of qualified students, failing out in numbers far exceeding those who were qualified. Don’t let the subject of affirmative action fall back into oblivion. The oft overlooked protection against such discriminatory practices is the 14th Amendment to the US constitution. Below are the types of instances which this amendment has been invoked: … addresses many aspects of citizenship and the rights of citizens. The most commonly used — and frequently litigated — phrase in the amendment is “ equal protection of the laws “, which figures prominently in a wide variety of landmark cases, including Brown v. Board of Education (racial discrimination), Roe v. Wade (reproductive rights), Bush v. Gore (election recounts), Reed v. Reed (gender discrimination), and University of California v. Bakke (racial quotas in education). (Note: emphasis mine) We did not get to this level of incompetency by sheer accident. The other program which paralleled affirmative action was called “wider recruitment” which was supposed to enable people who would not ordinarily be swept into the good graces of better education and more skillful jobs, to not be overlooked for lack of opportunity. Information was supposed to be disseminated beyond the barriers that were holding people back and given opportunities that extended beyond race. You’ve probably never heard of “wider recruitment” because it was never really actualized. Instead, this country has been inundated with hiring ads such as we are an equal opportunity employer, knowing full well that when these proclamations are seen, it is quite the reverse. We have to go back to adhering to the 14th Amendment – equal protection under the law. Quota systems such as I have been subject to, do not follow the 14th Amendment and hiring should revert to hiring the most qualified otherwise we will revert and slide deeper into the mire of racism and mediocrity. End Affirmative Action. It is not “inclusionary” as it was misguidedly supposed to be, but rather “exclusionary” as it has become. Ron Prager, November 7, 2021 Congresswoman Meng, I’ve sent you emails regarding several topics, and I don’t think that I’ve received any answers that I would count as substantive. One: who gave Dr. Fauci the greenlight to funnel money through a third party to the Wuhan Virology Lab? The second: what is the actual protocol for the removal of Biden from office either through the 25 th Amendment or from the lack of cognitive competency that would be expected from the Presidency of the United States? Third: what is the disastrous role he played in his incompetent drawback from Afghanistan ignoring his own Generals recommendations on how to properly proceed? Fourth: what will be the consequences of his incompetent handling of the Southern Border Crisis leaving our border totally open with Covid carrying illegal immigrants, drug shipments and all the mayhem that has accompanied his “Open Border Policy”? Fifth: the long-term consequence of his closing down the Keystone XL pipeline making our Country energy dependent upon foreign countries to fill the gap and capitulating to that dimwit Ocasio Cortez? We’ve gone from debacle to debacle, crisis to crisis and I still don’t know who really is running our government. Could you provide me with some answers before we go into runaway inflation and before Biden’s son is able to send us down the river with corruption and the FBI afraid to broach the Biden corruption issue. Ron Prager, October 24, 2021 Congresswoman Meng, It is not that time is running out; it has run out. Biden clearly is making disastrous decisions. The Afghani people who have worked with us, are going to be killed along with Americans who still remain in Afghanistan. He left the records of Afghani people’s pay stubs, phone numbers and addresses who have been our allies. They will be murdered, hanged or otherwise butchered. All of Biden’s assurances that all is well have been lies and by now I’m sure that you know that. The 25 th Amendment must be invoked. Biden has to be put out to pasture realizing also that Harris is of unknown competency, but it is a chance that we have to take, and unfortunately our only choice. Congresswoman Meng, It is clearly time to remove Joe Biden as President. He is not competent to run this government as seen in this past week; let him have a totally unscripted press conference without pre-selecting neither the questions nor reporters. Have it run for about an hour – no teleprompters nor notes nor photographs of the reporters, and then the American people will have a picture of what they have chosen as their President. I fear that we will all see the mistake that was made, but we must give the American people the chance to see the outrage that was perpetrated upon them.   Dear (Texas) Governor Abbott, I’m a long way from Texas, but I have seen you speak on several newscasts about the Border Crisis. Our incompetent president (I use lower case because I don’t recognize his legitimacy) is going from one disaster to another, starting with the XL Pipeline, the Afghanistan debacle to where we are now – an overflow of illegal aliens being transported throughout the United States in clear violation of Biden’s Constitutional Oath of keeping American safe from foreign intrusion. This is not a Nation that can withstand four years of Biden’s (or for that matter, Harris’) destruction. I’m asking that you call out the State’s National Guard to turn back the tide of disastrous policy making that Biden seems to want to adhere to. His motives are unclear: is it deliberate policy or is it his cognitive deficiency that he’s making us all suffer? I don’t pretend to know the answer, but what I do know is the Nation is in great jeopardy. Ron Prager, September 24, 2021 Governor Kathy Hochul, Governor, I’m not hearing any movement in the “No Cash Bail Reform” laws. It should be unequivocally rescinded. This is not party politics; it is sheer madness to not permit judges to perform their sworn duties. We need rational change not radical change and the “No Cash Bail Reform” does not conform to anything but ideological error and non-rationality. Do you plan on trying to rescind “No Cash Bail Reform” laws or are we going to have to vote you out of office for shunning the concerns of honest New Yorkers giving priority to criminals who should have their day in court instead of putting New Yorkers at risk over this insane “No Cash Bail Reform” law? Let the judges make the assessment, not the politicians. This is one of the reasons that Andrew Cuomo was relieved of his office. I would like to hear you speak loudly on this issue.  (This letter will be sent also to my State Senator Joseph Addabbo and State Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi.) Ron Prager, September 19, 2021 Governor Kathy Hochul, Yes, I believe Rikers should temporarily be closed, but it’s inmates should be transferred to other State facilities until new and safer facilities could be built there. I suspect that de Blasio’s main reason for wanting the prison closed is to “sell” development “contracts” to his political allies and friends. That should come as no surprise since his wife garnered $1.25 billion to fund a non-functional program called “ThriveNYC”. The only people thriving are de Blasio and his wife. And please look into this abuse of power and corruption. |

This is Project no. 1, The Speech to Inform, from the Speaking to Inform advanced manual. In modern American life, we see politics all around us – we see candidates, ads, debates, controversies – we see these everywhere. But where does all this come from? Does it just pop into existence, out of nothing? Let’s do a little thought experiment. Imagine that someone has some ideas for government policies that he’d like to see (let’s say it’s a guy) – that he’d like to see enacted into law, and he thinks the best way to do that would be to get elected to Congress and work on his proposals from there. He knows that to get elected, he’ll have to get on the ballot, and to do that, he’ll have to collect signatures. So he collects signatures, gets on the ballot, and then campaigns – he puts ads in the media and goes around making speeches. And he gets elected. Now let’s change the scenario just a little bit. Everything is the same, except that as soon as this person decides to run for office, he finds some like-minded people who are willing to help him try to get elected. They help him gather signatures, they contribute money for his campaign expenses, they help him place ads in the media, and they help him line up speaking engagements. And he gets elected. Now the second scenario is much more likely to happen than the first one is. So where do candidates find people to help them? Do they ask people randomly on the street if they’d like to help? No – they go to places where people have already self-identified as being sympathetic to the candidate’s views. These places are political party clubs, and they’re here, there, and everywhere. But they get almost no press coverage, and only a small percentage of the population gets involved in them, so they are practically invisible. And these clubs are sometimes called political machines. That term is often used in a derisive way, as in, “Such-and-such terrible thing was done by a political machine.” They’re practically invisible, and they’re political machines, so I call them “invisible machines.” I think they’re interesting because so much of American political life happens in them, yet they fly under the radar most of the time. Who joins these clubs? In general, their members are people who would like to see certain values promoted in our society, but other than that, it’s impossible to generalize about them. Some are well educated, some are not. Some are articulate, some are not. Some are wealthy, some are not. And they come from all walks of life. What goes on in these clubs? They support candidates when they can, but generally they also have monthly meetings, and this will sound familiar to Toastmasters: They have speakers at their meetings. They’re always looking for people who can come in and talk knowledgeably about issues that are of interest to them – education, law enforcement, programs to help the poor and the elderly, and on and on. And when candidates turn up – either from inside or outside of a club – their members often volunteer to help them. They help in all kinds of ways – collecting signatures, handing out literature, helping with campaign appearances, whatever it takes to promote their candidate and try to get people to vote for him or her. And incidentally it’s when the candidates get on the ballot and start campaigning that they start getting press coverage – that’s when they become visible – but in general, the clubs remain invisible to the media. There are several things that are good to understand about candidates. First, they tend to be headstrong – sometimes that’s warranted and sometimes it isn’t. They’re convinced that their policy proposals will have the beneficial effects that they predict. Also, they have to be thick-skinned. They go from one campaign appearance to another, and very often they have to face people who don’t like them and are quite vocal about it. Candidates have to be able to keep on going in spite of occasional hostile receptions. They have to be energetic. They have to have the physical and mental energy to do campaign appearances and other kinds of campaign work, during most of their waking hours for the duration of the campaign. And they have to be risk-takers. Most of them have good jobs when they’re running for office, and if they’re elected, they’ll have to quit their jobs, and then face uncertainty about what they’ll do after their term in office is up. So they have to be willing to take major risks with their careers. Now, we’ve often heard people say they’re disappointed in the choice of candidates we have. But the candidates we have are, by definition, the ones who stepped forward and expressed their intention of running for office. No one can be forced to run for office. If we don’t have better candidates, that’s because you, you, you, and you aren’t running for office. But don’t look at me – I don’t complain about the lack of good candidates. There is one systematic way of finding good candidates. Some clubs have candidate search committees – they try to identify and recruit good candidates, and that sometimes works. So maybe I’ve gotten you interested in this – maybe you’d like to see for yourself these invisible machines. Maybe you’d like to find a political club, go to a meeting, or a few meetings, and maybe even join one and get involved. If you do that, that would be great. But I just ask this of you – if you do that, I hope you’ll do it **in addition to** being in Toastmasters – I hope you won’t join a political club and leave Toastmasters behind. Because Toastmasters is where improving your communication and leadership skills can be a wonderful life-long adventure. Mr. Contest Chair.

This is Project no. 1, The Speech to Inform, from the Speaking to Inform advanced manual. In modern American life, we see politics all around us – we see candidates, ads, debates, controversies – we see these everywhere. But where does all this come from? Does it just pop into existence, out of nothing? Let’s do a little thought experiment. Imagine that someone has some ideas for government policies that he’d like to see (let’s say it’s a guy) – that he’d like to see enacted into law, and he thinks the best way to do that would be to get elected to Congress and work on his proposals from there. He knows that to get elected, he’ll have to get on the ballot, and to do that, he’ll have to collect signatures. So he collects signatures, gets on the ballot, and then campaigns – he puts ads in the media and goes around making speeches. And he gets elected. Now let’s change the scenario just a little bit. Everything is the same, except that as soon as this person decides to run for office, he finds some like-minded people who are willing to help him try to get elected. They help him gather signatures, they contribute money for his campaign expenses, they help him place ads in the media, and they help him line up speaking engagements. And he gets elected. Now the second scenario is much more likely to happen than the first one is. So where do candidates find people to help them? Do they ask people randomly on the street if they’d like to help? No – they go to places where people have already self-identified as being sympathetic to the candidate’s views. These places are political party clubs, and they’re here, there, and everywhere. But they get almost no press coverage, and only a small percentage of the population gets involved in them, so they are practically invisible. And these clubs are sometimes called political machines. That term is often used in a derisive way, as in, “Such-and-such terrible thing was done by a political machine.” They’re practically invisible, and they’re political machines, so I call them “invisible machines.” I think they’re interesting because so much of American political life happens in them, yet they fly under the radar most of the time. Who joins these clubs? In general, their members are people who would like to see certain values promoted in our society, but other than that, it’s impossible to generalize about them. Some are well educated, some are not. Some are articulate, some are not. Some are wealthy, some are not. And they come from all walks of life. What goes on in these clubs? They support candidates when they can, but generally they also have monthly meetings, and this will sound familiar to Toastmasters: They have speakers at their meetings. They’re always looking for people who can come in and talk knowledgeably about issues that are of interest to them – education, law enforcement, programs to help the poor and the elderly, and on and on. And when candidates turn up – either from inside or outside of a club – their members often volunteer to help them. They help in all kinds of ways – collecting signatures, handing out literature, helping with campaign appearances, whatever it takes to promote their candidate and try to get people to vote for him or her. And incidentally it’s when the candidates get on the ballot and start campaigning that they start getting press coverage – that’s when they become visible – but in general, the clubs remain invisible to the media. There are several things that are good to understand about candidates. First, they tend to be headstrong – sometimes that’s warranted and sometimes it isn’t. They’re convinced that their policy proposals will have the beneficial effects that they predict. Also, they have to be thick-skinned. They go from one campaign appearance to another, and very often they have to face people who don’t like them and are quite vocal about it. Candidates have to be able to keep on going in spite of occasional hostile receptions. They have to be energetic. They have to have the physical and mental energy to do campaign appearances and other kinds of campaign work, during most of their waking hours for the duration of the campaign. And they have to be risk-takers. Most of them have good jobs when they’re running for office, and if they’re elected, they’ll have to quit their jobs, and then face uncertainty about what they’ll do after their term in office is up. So they have to be willing to take major risks with their careers. Now, we’ve often heard people say they’re disappointed in the choice of candidates we have. But the candidates we have are, by definition, the ones who stepped forward and expressed their intention of running for office. No one can be forced to run for office. If we don’t have better candidates, that’s because you, you, you, and you aren’t running for office. But don’t look at me – I don’t complain about the lack of good candidates. There is one systematic way of finding good candidates. Some clubs have candidate search committees – they try to identify and recruit good candidates, and that sometimes works. So maybe I’ve gotten you interested in this – maybe you’d like to see for yourself these invisible machines. Maybe you’d like to find a political club, go to a meeting, or a few meetings, and maybe even join one and get involved. If you do that, that would be great. But I just ask this of you – if you do that, I hope you’ll do it **in addition to** being in Toastmasters – I hope you won’t join a political club and leave Toastmasters behind. Because Toastmasters is where improving your communication and leadership skills can be a wonderful life-long adventure. Mr. Contest Chair.

More Opinions... Did You Know... A “New” Portrait with “Old” Kentucky Roots In 2024, descendants of Justice Robert Trimble donated an early nineteenth-century portrait of their ancestor. The portrait depicts Trimble around the time of his appointment as a federal district judge for the District of Kentucky in 1817. Trimble previously served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals and ran a successful private law practice. In 1826, President John Quincy Adams appointed Trimble to the Supreme Court, but his tenure lasted only two years. He died of a sudden illness during the summer of 1828. The well-executed portrait is a period copy of a work in the collection of the Kentucky Historical Society by Matthew Harris Jouett, one of the most prolific portrait painters of the nineteenth century. Over the course of his career, Jouett captured two additional Supreme Court Justices with Kentucky roots, Thomas Todd and John McKinley.
