He is a strong believer in the power of local governance to shape lasting change and continuously improve our city for the next generation of New Yorkers. Since assuming office on January 1, 2022, Borough President Levine has been working to create a more equitable, more resilient, and healthier city by striving to ensure the policies, solutions, and work of the Manhattan Borough President’s office benefit everyday people, especially historically disenfranchised communities. While in office, Borough President Levine has successfully launched initiatives to strengthen equity and resilience throughout the borough, including: The Million More Trees plan, which will expand the urban canopy, especially in chronically underplanted neighborhoods. The Manhattan Small Business Booster Loans program, which has provided $2 million in interest-free loans to local entrepreneurs suffering from the pandemic. Steering the effort to establish an NYC Waterfront Protection Agency that would lead the design, construction, management, and governance of coastal resiliency projects, currently overseen by 11 different city agencies. The Campaign to Curb Congestion, which advocates for the implementation of two-way, variable congestion pricing, reforming e-commerce and deliveries, and expanding cycling infrastructure, especially through a dedicated bike lane on the West Side Highway. The Borough President also strives to create a civic and political life in Manhattan that is more accessible and transparent so that all people have equal representation and a place to voice their concerns and values. Borough President Levine leans heavily on his past experiences as a public school teacher, community organizer, and two-term member of the New York City Council. Combined, these experiences have allowed him to encounter New Yorkers of all walks of life and instilled in him a set of values that prioritize compassion, cultural understanding, and curiosity – all of which motivate his work as Manhattan Borough President. At the start of his career, Mark taught bilingual math and science at Junior High School 149 in District 7 in the South Bronx. During his visits with students in their homes and around the community, Mark saw first-hand the struggles of many of the families and became determined to make a lasting change. After noticing that many of these families were being held back by the lack of financial services in the neighborhood, Mark found the Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union, a community development financial institution, which has made $25 million (and counting) in small loans to low-income families and small businesses in Northern Manhattan. Mark was twice elected to represent the 7th City Council District – one of the most diverse in New York City – covering West Harlem/Hamilton Heights, Morningside Heights, and parts of the Upper West Side and Washington Heights. In his eight years in the City Council, Mark was a leading voice in New York City for tenants rights, public health, and equity in our schools, transit, parks, and housing. In a historic first for the nation, Mark passed legislation guaranteeing a right to counsel for tenants facing eviction in New York City’s housing courts. The data is now irrefutable – the Right to Counsel law is a core reason why New Yorkers facing eviction are staying in their homes, off the streets, and out of the shelter system. As chair of the City Council Health Committee, Mark rose to national prominence as a leader in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. He has fought for health policy based on science and has consistently taken on the racial inequity of both the pandemic and healthcare more broadly. While chairing the Council’s Parks Committee in his first term, Mark championed greater investment in our city’s green spaces – securing tens of millions of dollars in funding for neglected parks in low-income neighborhoods. He has been a champion for improved bus service, more accessible subway stations, and streets that are safer for all, including pedestrians and bicyclists. Mark earned a B.A. in physics from Haverford College and a master’s in public policy from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. Mark lives with his family in Washington Heights. He and his wife, Ivelisse, are proud parents of their sons, Alejandro and Daniel. Mark speaks Spanish, Hebrew, and a smattering of other languages.

Air quality is an issue across public health, disability, climate, and more. From ongoing air quality issues caused by wildfire smoke to our experience with COVID-19 and the specter of future pandemics, worrying about air quality has become part of the daily lives of New Yorkers. Our indoor air can greatly impact the level of risk associated with getting sick or can help exacerbate existing chronic conditions like asthma and heart disease. Borough President Levine and Council Member Keith Powers have introduced a comprehensive package of legislation to set NYC on a path toward better ensuring that we know and can improve the air quality in schools, municipal buildings, and commercial and residential spaces. These bills would require the City to publicly post information and data on air quality in the common spaces of these buildings – including temperatures, humidity, and air changes per hour (where practicable), as well as airborne pollutants like carbon dioxide, monoxide, and particle pollution: Intros 1127 and 1128 would require real-time monitoring and reporting on air quality in public schools and City-owned building common spaces, and would require the creation and updating of rules setting standards for indoor air quality in these buildings annually. Intros 1127 and 1128 would require real-time monitoring and reporting on air quality in public schools and City-owned building common spaces, and would require the creation and updating of rules setting standards for indoor air quality in these buildings annually. Intro 1129 would establish a five-year pilot program to monitor indoor air quality in common spaces in commercial buildings, with data shared in real time to participants in these buildings. During the pilot, the City would install real-time indoor air quality monitors in all common spaces regularly open to the public and, with the consent of tenants, in spaces occupied by tenants in buildings participating in the pilot. The data gathered would be posted conspicuously in building common spaces and displayed as a real-time dashboard available to the public. would establish a five-year pilot program to monitor indoor air quality in common spaces in commercial buildings, with data shared in real time to participants in these buildings.

Intro 1130 would set up a five-year pilot program to monitor indoor air quality in common spaces of residential buildings, with data shared in real-time to participants in these buildings. As with Intro 1129, the City would install real-time indoor air quality monitors in all common spaces (e.g. lobbies, hallways, gyms). This package of bills would also require the City to educate New Yorkers about the importance of clean indoor air, including how to understand real-time air quality data and recommendations on how to improve air quality in their buildings. We know that our indoor air is a key factor for reducing the risk of spreading disease and mitigating flareups of existing chronic illnesses and disabilities. As we address the current and future climate change crises, it is vital that we begin the hard work of ensuring that our air is healthy and clean. These bills begin us on that path.

We are committed to ensuring that development, improvement projects, and land use policies are responsive to community concerns while also providing the housing, jobs, and public benefits that our city needs. The City Charter requires each Borough President to have a planning office to prepare for the growth, improvement, and development of the borough and to review and make recommendations on applications and proposals for the use and development of land. One of the central responsibilities of the Manhattan Borough President’s office is its charter-mandated role in the City’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). The office reviews applications after the Community Board holds a public hearing and vote on the matter and before reviews by both the City Planning Commission and the City Council. ULURP gives the Borough President the opportunity to review the land use and environmental impacts of projects while also evaluating community concerns. The Land Use & Planning department also identifies emerging land use issues and conducts research and data and policy analysis to propose and advocate for solutions to these issues. Recent Work Housing Manhattanites In January 2023, the MBPO released Housing Manhattanites , a report that identifies sites and neighborhoods where housing can be built. The report includes over 170 individual sites and 9 different neighborhoods that collectively could produce over 73,000 new units of housing. Madison Square Garden For decades, the future of Penn Station has been tangled up in the question of whether Madison Square Garden could be relocated. When MSG’s special permit was last extended in 2013, the hope was that a ten-year term would be sufficient to plan and complete the relocation of the arena. Today, a relocation plan is no closer to reality than it was a decade ago. But that doesn’t mean we can’t create a world class Penn Station. ULURP Responsibilities One of the key responsibilities of the Borough President’s office is participation in ULURP – the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. ULURP is the city’s process for changes to zoning and other actions impacting land use. The Borough President reviews all applications and provides an official recommendation, weighing the impacts of the proposal and stakeholder’s input, and identifying improvements.

HOME HOME C C Resources Resources C C Land Use & Planning Land Use & Planning Land Use & Planning Our office plays a key role in land use decisions throughout the borough of Manhattan. We are committed to ensuring that development, improvement projects, and land use policies are responsive to community concerns while also providing the housing, jobs, and public benefits that our city needs. The City Charter requires each Borough President to have a planning office to prepare for the growth, improvement, and development of the borough and to review and make recommendations on applications and proposals for the use and development of land. One of the central responsibilities of the Manhattan Borough President’s office is its charter-mandated role in the City’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). The office reviews applications after the Community Board holds a public hearing and vote on the matter and before reviews by both the City Planning Commission and the City Council. ULURP gives the Borough President the opportunity to review the land use and environmental impacts of projects while also evaluating community concerns. The Land Use & Planning department also identifies emerging land use issues and conducts research and data and policy analysis to propose and advocate for solutions to these issues. Recent Work Housing Manhattanites Housing Manhattanites In January 2023, the MBPO released Housing Manhattanites , a report that identifies sites and neighborhoods where housing can be built. The report includes over 170 individual sites and 9 different neighborhoods that collectively could produce over 73,000 new units of housing.   Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden For decades, the future of Penn Station has been tangled up in the question of whether Madison Square Garden could be relocated. When MSG’s special permit was last extended in 2013, the hope was that a ten-year term would be sufficient to plan and complete the relocation of the arena. Today, a relocation plan is no closer to reality than it was a decade ago. But that doesn’t mean we can’t create a world class Penn Station.   ULURP Responsibilities One of the key responsibilities of the Borough President’s office is participation in ULURP – the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. ULURP is the city’s process for changes to zoning and other actions impacting land use. The Borough President reviews all applications and provides an official recommendation, weighing the impacts of the proposal and stakeholder’s input, and identifying improvements. Applications are certified or referred by the Department of City Planning, and then can be reviewed by the relevant Community Boards, the Borough Board (made up of Manhattan’s City Council members and Community Board chairs), the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and then finally the City Council.

Overview A mental health crisis is playing out on the streets of New York City. Decades of disinvestment have left a behavioral health system with insufficient resources and inadequate capacity at almost every level. The result: We are failing New Yorkers with serious mental illness. Individuals with untreated psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder too often wind up homeless on our streets. It is critical that we get them the care they need, including hospitalization when necessary. But Manhattan has lost hundreds of in-patient psychiatric beds in recent years. This means that patients who should be admitted for psychiatric care are too often sent back out to the street, and those who are admitted are too often discharged before they are fully stable. A horrible cycle follows. Those patients who are successfully stabilized by the time they leave the hospital need on-going care through community-based outpatient services, peer-support programs, and more. But here again, a significant lack of capacity means that patients are vulnerable to falling through the cracks and back into crisis. The most proven, effective long-term support mechanism for people struggling with serious mental illness is supportive housing. But a shortage of units has resulted in a years-long backlog. In the meantime, those without stable housing are far more likely to land back in the streets and subways. This plan addresses these myriad failings. We are calling for: Expansion in the number of long-term psychiatric beds Initiatives to address the severe shortage of clinical staff in behavioral health Concrete steps to develop more supportive housing Expansion of community-based and peer led programs Doubling of Intensive Mobile Treatment teams for street outreach Giving EMS workers the ability to provide opioid withdrawal treatment medication These investments will not be cheap. Some will be politically complicated. But our city has a moral obligation to build a system that better serves New Yorkers with serious mental illness. If we don’t act boldly and quickly, a human tragedy will continue to play out on our streets.  1. Create 600+ new in-patient and extended care psychiatric beds in New York City  Create 400 new beds in the Transition to Home program on Randalls Island. In 2022, New York State launched a new in-patient treatment program for patients experiencing homelessness with serious mental illnesses. The Transition to Home Units (THU) at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center (MPC), a secure facility on Randall’s Island, is designed for recently or chronically homeless patients experiencing serious mental illness who would benefit from patient-centered care to prepare for independent living . Patients are brought directly from public hospital emergency departments when physicians determine that it would not be safe to discharge them. for recently or chronically homeless patients experiencing serious mental illness who would benefit from patient-centered care to prepare for independent living The THU program in New York City currently consists of only 50 beds. This does not come close to matching the scale of the need. We propose a dramatic expansion, with the addition of 400 more THU beds at MPC’s Randall’s Island campus. This facility includes two large buildings (the north and south wings) which sit entirely vacant. We propose renovating them to be the home of the expanded THU units. Currently only public hospital emergency departments are eligible to refer patients to the THU, and the vast majority of patients are referred by Bellevue Hospital. The dramatic expansion we propose should allow more public emergency departments to refer patients to THU, and allow private hospitals to participate as well. We propose that funding for the program expansion should in part be funded by contributions from the private hospitals. Create 240 new Health + Hospitals (H+H) Extended Care Unit beds. The average stay in H+H’s acute psychiatric inpatient care is a little more than two weeks. Most patients are then discharged, despite the fact that many would benefit from longer-term care. H+H has begun to address this challenge by establishing Extended Care Units (ECUs) at Belleview and Kings County hospitals where patients can stay for months. This voluntary program provides patients with psychopharmacological treatment, rehabilitative activities, and opportunities to strengthen interpersonal and communication skills. The average stay in these units is 90 days. The program has been successful at providing its patients with pathways toward re-acclimating into independent living. Unfortunately, only 60 beds are available in the ECU program system-wide. This is far below the needed capacity for the city, meaning that most H+H patients who would benefit from such extended-stay psychiatric services do not receive them. To close this gap, we propose dramatically increasing the number of beds in these units to a total of 300, an increase of 240 beds. 2. Address staffing shortages in behavioral health Hospitals in New York City face a significant shortage of behavioral health staff, including psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, psychiatric physician assistants, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. This presents a major challenge to the expansion of behavioral health care. In order to help address these shortages, the MBPO recommends the following steps: Expand student loan debt forgiveness for behavioral health providers in H+H. Behavioral health staff often carry large student loan debt, without the prospect of earning salaries as high as many other specialties. This has created a significant obstacle in recruiting and retaining staff in psychiatric professions. To address this challenge, H+H has established the Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BH4NYC). Participating physicians receive up to $50,000 in student debt forgiveness. Non-physician clinicians are eligible for a maximum of $30,000. All participants must commit to working a minimum of three years full-time at H+H. To date BH4NYC has been funded exclusively by philanthropic contributions, and has only had funding for 32 participants. We propose that the City provide funding for another 200 participants, which we estimate would cost a total of $8 million. Such an expansion would provide a dramatic boost to H+H’s ability to maintain the staffing it needs for critical behavior health care. Create a CUNY rotation for social work and psychology students at Clubhouse programs. Clubhouses are community-based sites which help people struggling with mental illness through a program of peer support, a work-centered day, consensus decision making, social and recreational events, employment assistance, and more. To help awareness of and improve the staffing pipeline for Clubhouses, and to improve understanding of the model by the broader provider community, we propose creating a new clinical rotation at these sites. This would be run by the CUNY schools of social work and clinical psychology, which would create a social practice rotation with student placements in some or all of the Clubhouses in New York City. Keep up with the cost of living for behavioral health service providers. Non-profit human service organizations are a critical pillar of New York’s behavioral health system, but the contracts these organizations receive from the City and State provide for salaries which have not kept pace with the rate of inflation. This has resulted in high turnover and vacancy rates for staff in roles that provide critical behavior health and related social services for New Yorkers struggling with serious mental illness. To address this crisis, we are calling on the City and State to establish, fund and enforce automatic, ongoing annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) tied to inflation on all human services contracts, including behavioral health services. 3. Create and improve access to supportive housing  Get major supportive housing projects across the finish line. There is consensus now that supportive housing is highly effective in helping formerly homeless individuals struggling with mental illness to lead stable lives, and avoid returning to the street. Yet in many cases when such housing is proposed for specific sites, there is strong opposition from local communities. In fact, well-run supportive housing projects end up enhancing, not harming, neighborhoods. To address the crisis of serious mental illness playing out on our streets and subways, it is critical that we increase the pace of construction of new supportive housing. The most immediate priority is to ensure projects currently in the pipeline make it to the finish line. There are three high-priority supportive housing projects in process in Manhattan, all of which have faced some local opposition. It is critical that each of these be built: 1727 Amsterdam (at 145th St.) – 120 supportive units & 80 affordable units for families The Lirio (at 54th St. at 10th Ave) – 67 supportive units & 44 affordable units for families Timbale Terrace (Park Ave at E. 118th St.) – 99 supportive units & 230 affordable units for families Pass zoning text amendments that would allow for the creation of more affordable and supportive housing. The Department of City Planning has proposed citywide zoning text amendments, known as “City of Yes for Housing Opportunity”, which would facilitate the creation of more housing in New York City. The proposal includes a new Universal Affordability Preference, which would provide floor area ratio (FAR) bonuses for developments that include either affordable or supportive housing units. We support FAR bonuses that would incentivize the creation of supportive housing. The Borough President also believes that this provision should encourage developers to set aside space for on-site services for supportive housing residents to ensure their ability to remain in permanent housing. Ensure New Yorkers are placed in the housing that best suits their needs. Chronically homeless New Yorkers in need of supportive housing in New York City must go through a centralized process to determine eligibility for the two major types of supportive housing – community care, which is permanent supportive housing that provides case management with social workers, and Level II/Licensed beds, which provide wraparound services including medication management. While the City has improved this system to address slow referral times and high vacancy rates, there remain administrative issues that result in placing New Yorkers in the type of supportive housing that isn’t appropriate for their needs or situation. As a result, residents, support staff, and operators are put in situations that lead to conflict and strain. The Human Resources Administration should improve the Coordinated Assessment Placement System (CAPS) to ensure clients are only referred for placement in for the exact type of housing that best suits them. Ensure that the highest need New Yorkers are prioritized for supportive housing. While Intensive Mobile Treatment (IMT) Teams can include housing and benefits specialists, it remains difficult to connect to housing due to long wait times and administrative constraints in the overall supportive housing system. IMT clients, among some of our most vulnerable New Yorkers, have already been identified, have a connection to the City, and are already building relationships with trusted service providers. The City should designate a number of supportive housing units as priority slots for IMT clients – allowing IMT staff to connect their clients directly with housing. Expand family care housing opportunities and peer support programs. The NYS Office of Mental Health’s Family Care program places New Yorkers with serious mental health diagnoses who are in recovery in a home with a member of the local community. Providers are trained, certified and able to offer the support needed for clients to relearn how to live independently. Placements are often long-term, allowing for clients and family care providers to build strong familial and community connections. There are roughly 23 homes boroughwide serving approximately 100 individuals, but there is strong demand for more capacity. The State and City should ramp up efforts to expand the pool of trained and certified providers by doing more to recruit interested and willing participants into the program. 4. Invest in and expand behavioral health treatment  Double the number of Intensive Mobile Treatment teams from 31 to 62; create capacity to support 1500 New Yorkers in Need. Intensive Mobile Treatment (IMT) teams are full service mental health treatment teams comprised of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, case managers, and peer specialists that provide long-term wraparound services directly to New Yorkers – meeting them at shelters, street corners, park plazas, and more. While not all are unhoused, IMT teams’ clients often struggle with chronic street homelessness, serious mental illness, co-occurring substance-use disorders and years of trauma and distrust. These teams offer clients in need basic supports like warm meals and clothes, to long-term psychiatric care, medication and connections to supportive housing. As of May 2023, the program was comprised of 31 IMT teams, serving roughly 800 New Yorkers across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens, with at least 250 more on the wait list. The City should work to double the number of IMT teams and vastly increase the number of New Yorkers connected to ongoing psychiatric care, as well as housing and other forms of support that are needed. The City and State should also allow for more flexibility in the accreditation required to do this work to help address staffing constraints. Rapidly expand the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model in New York State. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) are outpatient clinics designed to help people access the treatment they need before experiencing the type of crisis that could require inpatient and emergency department care. These clinics provide a wide range of care and are required to provide care coordination to help individuals navigate the complicated and often disjointed behavioral health care system. New York State has begun to expand this initiative, but devoting more funding and resources to CCBHCs would allow the city to meet today’s behavioral health challenges head on. The Federal Government has made funding available, and expansion of this model would save public dollars by intervening before inpatient care is required. 5. Improve access to substance use disorder treatment and connections to care Many New Yorkers with serious mental illness also struggle with opioid misuse, enormously complicating their path to a stable life. The rapid proliferation of fentanyl has made New York City’s overdose crisis even more acute. Fortunately new medication treatments like buprenorphine can help reduce opioid misuse and opioid use disorder-related symptoms. However many of the patients who would benefit from such medications are not receiving them. This is particularly true for New Yorkers with mental illness. Give EMS workers the ability to provide buprenorphine. EMS workers are increasingly responding to calls to treat opioid overdose or opioid withdrawal. They are authorized to administer naloxone to revive patients. Typically in such cases the patients refuse transport to hospital, foreclosing the possibility that they would be connected to longer-term treatments and care. To address this challenge, EMS units in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are now authorized to administer buprenorphine to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal regardless of whether the patient decides to go to the hospital. Patients are then able to schedule a virtual follow up with a doctor within 24 hours to get a buprenorphine prescription and be connected to other critical harm reduction resources. New York City should create a similar program. We propose establishing a three-year pilot program during which all 911-participating ambulances serving designated neighborhoods with high overdose rates would be required to carry and offer buprenorphine as part of their services for patients who have been revived from an overdose. This would require training for EMS responders to use the medication, as well as to ensure that EMS could adequately connect patients with nonprofit service providers to ensure they received continued support and care.

The boards are pivotal in shaping their communities and work to enhance and preserve the character of the city’s many unique neighborhoods. Manhattan’s 12 community boards are composed of 50 volunteer members serving staggered two-year terms – thus, 25 members are appointed (or reappointed) each year. Each board has a budget, a district manager and staff, and has three distinct responsibilities: Monitoring the delivery of city services such as sanitation and street maintenance; Planning and reviewing land use applications including zoning changes; and Making recommendations for each year’s city budget. Community boards consider a wide range of issues, including distribution of liquor licenses, consideration of sidewalk café applications, and permits for street fairs and other outdoor events. They may also weigh in issues before the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Board of Standards and Appeals (the city agency dedicated to land-use and zoning regulation), and provide input on proposals from city agencies. Members are officially appointed by the Manhattan Borough President. Half of the members of these boards are selected unilaterally by the Manhattan Borough President, and half are nominated by the City Council Members whose districts overlap with the Community District. Community board members must live, work, or have an otherwise significant interest in the neighborhoods served by the community district, and be a New York City resident. In addition, we look for applicants with histories of community involvement, expertise and skill sets, attendance at board meetings. No more than 25 percent of the members of any board may be New York City employees. Find your community board!

Community board meetings are managed with a parliamentary structure (much like the City Council or U.S. Congress). Every board has an Executive Committee elected by the board that includes a chair, vice chairs, a secretary and a treasurer. Boards are empowered to establish their own committee structure and procedures, based upon the needs of their districts, and frequently include Land Use and Zoning, Parks and Waterfront, Health and Human Services, Nightlife and Business Applications, Transportation, Landmarks and Preservation, and Education and Youth Services. Each community board member is expected to serve on a minimum of two committees. All community board meetings are open to the public. The full board of each district meets once a month; meetings rotate locations but are held at the same monthly times. Committees meet more frequently to discuss their individual areas of responsibility.  Borough Board and Borough Service Cabinet Your Subtitle Goes Here Two borough-wide boards meet each month and bring together representatives from community boards. The 2025 meeting calendar is available here .

Each board has a budget, a district manager and staff, and has three distinct responsibilities: Monitoring the delivery of city services such as sanitation and street maintenance; Planning and reviewing land use applications including zoning changes; and Making recommendations for each year’s city budget. Community boards consider a wide range of issues, including distribution of liquor licenses, consideration of sidewalk café applications, and permits for street fairs and other outdoor events. They may also weigh in issues before the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Board of Standards and Appeals (the city agency dedicated to land-use and zoning regulation), and provide input on proposals from city agencies. Members are officially appointed by the Manhattan Borough President. Half of the members of these boards are selected unilaterally by the Manhattan Borough President, and half are nominated by the City Council Members whose districts overlap with the Community District. Community board members must live, work, or have an otherwise significant interest in the neighborhoods served by the community district, and be a New York City resident. In addition, we look for applicants with histories of community involvement, expertise and skill sets, attendance at board meetings. No more than 25 percent of the members of any board may be New York City employees. Find your community board! Find your community board!

Each community board member is expected to serve on a minimum of two committees. All community board meetings are open to the public. The full board of each district meets once a month; meetings rotate locations but are held at the same monthly times.

Our housing shortage is not the only affordability crisis facing New Yorkers – families with children under five are also facing a childcare affordability crisis that is pricing them out of our city, with serious implications for our economy, communities, and social fabric. Over 441,000 children under five reside in New York City, and 80% of families find the cost of childcare – particularly for infants and toddlers – to be unreasonably high. Families often pay a fifth of their income in childcare costs. High-quality early childcare and education in a predictable and safe environment, as well as early intervention services where needed, foster and support critical cognitive, social and emotional growth for young children during one of the most important times in their development. But despite strides made with Pre-K and 3-K for All, only 24% of children under five currently benefit from public childcare, leaving most families struggling to find affordable options. These challenges disproportionately affect single-parent families, essential workers, low and middle-income families, reducing workforce participation and leading to economic and social strain, and is even causing families to leave the city altogether. It’s time to provide support for New York families with young children. It’s time for universal childcare.

This is why we must take a lane of traffic on the West Side Highway from 57th Street down to Chambers Street and turn it into a four-mile protected lane for people who are on bicycles, e-bikes, and other forms of micromobility. The creation of a new dedicated lane along the current bike path would ease congestion on the current greenway, minimizing conflicts and collisions between pedestrians, cyclists, and e-bikes. This proposal also complements New York City’s long-term resiliency goals and the eventual launch of Congestion Pricing in Manhattan by creating the infrastructure we’ll need to facilitate easy, convenient, and efficient travel without the use of a private car.

New York City is in the midst of the worst housing affordability crisis in its history. Soaring rents and plummeting housing production are a mounting disaster for low-income and working class families. NYC can not solve this crisis on its own. We need action from Albany to achieve twin, interlocking goals: accelerating the production of new housing and protecting vulnerable tenants.

We need action from Albany to achieve twin, interlocking goals: accelerating the production of new housing and protecting vulnerable tenants.   Albany makes tax policy. It controls limits on residential density in Manhattan, runs housing courts, sets the rules for rent regulation, and much more.

We need our allies in Albany to use these powers to help alleviate New York City’s housing crisis.  Below we outline eight housing policies that we believe the State must enact in this legislative session. Every one of them on its own is politically contentious.

BOOSTING OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION Replace the 421-a Tax Exemption The previous version of 421-a was flawed—it yielded too few affordable units, and offered little protection for workers. But the demise of this program in 2022 has caused housing production in NYC to plummet. The pause was so dramatic that it froze dozens of projects which were already underway (i.e. “vested”), depriving the city of an estimated 33,000 new units that were shovel ready.

The pause was so dramatic that it froze dozens of projects which were already underway (i.e. “vested”), depriving the city of an estimated 33,000 new units that were shovel ready. We urgently need to replace—and improve upon—421-a.  A deal is possible which offers enough of a tax incentive to spur housing production, while ensuring deep, permanent affordability, and strong labor guarantees. Projects which are currently vested should be given an extension, to immediately jumpstart much needed housing production. This much is clear: Allowing another year to pass without a replacement for 421-a would be devastating.

Facilitate Office Conversions Coming out of the pandemic there is a staggering 90 million sq ft. of vacant office space in Manhattan, mostly in older class B and C buildings. This challenge presents an opportunity: conversion of vacant offices to housing. But converting office buildings is complicated and expensive, and generally results in exclusively luxury apartments. This is what has happened in the large wave of conversions in Lower Manhattan post-9/11.

This is what has happened in the large wave of conversions in Lower Manhattan post-9/11. To facilitate the next wave of conversions, centered on Midtown, and to guarantee these buildings include truly affordable units, the State should authorize a new tax abatement program. Such a program could be modeled on the now-expired 421-g abatement used in Lower Manhattan, with the addition of strong affordability requirements.

Lift the 12 FAR Cap on Residential Development In many places around the nation (and in New York), States are trying to force local governments to remove obstacles to adding housing density. In Manhattan the opposite is true! We are in fact prohibited by the State from even considering rezonings that would allow for more than 12 FAR. This cap has been in place since 1961. Many of NYC’s most beloved buildings predating this rule, including several icons along Central Park West, would be illegal to build today because their FAR exceeds 12.  If we succeed in incentivizing office conversions as outlined above, some of those buildings would, insanely, only be allowed to fill half of their floors with housing because of the cap.

Lifting the cap would allow us to consider permitting more housing in the densest part of our borough. In all cases rezonings would continue to undergo the same community review process stipulated by ULURP. But to leave the 12 FAR cap in place is to deprive Manhattan of the means to do all we can to address our housing crisis.

Streamline Environmental Review Like other states, New York has critical laws in place that ensure that the environmental impact of major development projects is considered and mitigated. But in recent years New York’s State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) has too often become a weapon used to stop or delay projects that are in fact beneficial—environmentally and otherwise. For small and midsize affordable residential buildings, SEQR requirements add yet one more hurdle to the creation of desperately needed affordable housing.

PROTECTING OUR EXISTING HOUSING Ensure landlords can only evict tenants for good cause Nearly half of all rental units in NYC lack protection by rent regulation. This gives landlords wide latitude to raise rents by enormous annual increments, and to force tenants out at the end of their lease term for little or no cause. For hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, this has turned lease renewal into a perilous process, fueling our eviction crisis.

New York should enact legislation to protect tenants in unregulated housing, including a limit on rent increases .

As a result, a large and growing number of low-income tenants are enduring escalating rent burdens with no financial assistance.

New York should establish a statewide rental subsidy program for low-income families and individuals who are facing eviction, currently homeless, or facing loss of housing due to domestic violence or hazardous living conditions. This initiative, known as the Housing Access Voucher Program (HAVP), would help low-income New Yorkers achieve stability and retain permanent housing.

Expand Right to Counsel Statewide Since its enactment in 2017, NYC’s right to counsel program for tenants facing eviction has proven to be extraordinarily effective. It has brought greater fairness to housing courts, and data show that 84% of tenants who have received representation in the program have been able to remain in their homes.

Strengthen right to counsel in NYC Despite the enormously positive impact of the right to counsel program in NYC in the years before the pandemic, over the past two years a mounting wave of evictions has overwhelmed the system for tenant legal services. As a result, thousands of tenants who would have otherwise qualified for the program have had to face the threat of eviction without their right to counsel being fulfilled.

HOME C Resources C Land Use & Planning C ULURP Recommendations ULURP Recommendations One of the key responsibilities of the Borough President’s office is participation in ULURP – the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. ULURP is the city’s process for changes to zoning and other actions impacting land use. The Borough President participates throughout the process, reviews all applications, and weighs in with formal opinions – sounding the alarm on bad policy or improper decisions, identifying improvements, or formally approving when a proposal’s merits are overwhelming. The Borough President’s dedicated land use staff, independent of both the mayor’s administration and private development interests, scrutinizes applications on behalf of Manhattan residents.

ULURP is the city’s process for changes to zoning and other actions impacting land use. The Borough President participates throughout the process, reviews all applications, and weighs in with formal opinions – sounding the alarm on bad policy or improper decisions, identifying improvements, or formally approving when a proposal’s merits are overwhelming. The Borough President’s dedicated land use staff, independent of both the mayor’s administration and private development interests, scrutinizes applications on behalf of Manhattan residents. Most applications are certified or referred out by the Department of City Planning, and then can be reviewed by the relevant Community Boards, the Borough Board (made up of Manhattan’s City Council members and Community Board chairs), the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and then finally the City Council.

Trees are key weapons in our fight against climate change. They protect us in this era of extreme weather, absorbing runoff and cooling neighborhoods. Tree planting and cover throughout the city is also an issue of equity and environmental justice. Because NYC’s tree canopy is not evenly distributed, some neighborhoods have long enjoyed the benefits of extensive tree coverage, while communities of color and with lower incomes remain underplanted and undercovered. This accounts for drastic temperature differentials between neighborhoods. Communities with less tree coverage consistently record higher temperatures in the warmer months than elsewhere in the city, causing serious health and quality-of-life issues. The initiative would prioritize plantings in these neighborhoods to reduce heat vulnerability. Since January 1, 2023, we’ve made progress planting new trees – NYC Parks reports that the city has planted almost 1200 new street trees just in Manhattan, with around 800 more trees planned for the near future. But we still have work to do. We need to get more trees planted across our borough and city, and we need your help! Request a new street tree in your neighborhood! Call 311 or request online . Care for our city’s existing trees! It’s important to keep these trees healthy so they can continue to benefit us. Volunteer at a street tree stewardship project or become a super steward and get licensed to care for trees on your own. More information here .

Today, more than half of New Yorkers are paying more than 30% of their income in rent. There are bidding wars for rental apartments. Affordable housing developments with 170 units receive 80,000 tenant applications. It’s never been more clear that New York is in an affordable housing crisis. Month after month, demand for housing far outstrips supply, and the city’s anemic rate of housing production is barely making a dent. Our biggest obstacle is entirely homegrown: a zoning code from 1961 that makes it far too difficult for us to build the housing New Yorkers desperately need. Our current zoning code makes it hard to convert vacant office buildings to residences. It prioritizes construction of parking over apartments. It leaves little housing next to some transit hubs and prevents apartments from being built on top of stores in commercial districts. And worst of all: It does too little to ensure the construction of affordable homes. But we’re on the verge of making the change New Yorkers need.  Known as the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, this proposal from the NYC Department of City Planning would update and streamline zoning regulations in order to promote the creation of housing and affordable housing. These changes would create additional housing in Manhattan so that more of us can stay here and add housing around the boroughs to help relieve the affordability crisis that is afflicting people in Manhattan and every corner of our city. It’s time for New York to become a City of Yes.

The law succeeded at keeping the vast majority of tenants in their homes, and New York thankfully had an eviction moratorium in place during the first two years of the pandemic. But once the moratorium lapsed, eviction cases started to pile up. Now, the number of tenants who need representation has far outpaced the capacity of right to counsel attorneys, and tens of thousands of tenants are being made to navigate housing court on their own. Forcing eviction cases through the court system without securing tenants an attorney is a clear violation of the right to counsel law. We must act now to protect tenants from unfair eviction. Slow the Calendaring of Eviction Cases The legal services organizations that represent tenants facing eviction are at capacity, unable to take on more clients at the current pace. The Office of Court Administration must stop the breakneck speed and calendar cases at a pace that ensures that every tenant has access to the attorney the law promises. Cases where a tenant is unable to secure a right to counsel attorney must be administratively stayed and taken off the calendar until the tenant has an attorney under retainer. Evaluate Tenants for Grant Eligibility The Department of Social Services (DSS) needs to evaluate all tenants in non-payment cases in housing court for grant eligibility and take a more proactive approach to tenant support beyond legal representation. DSS can better help tenants who have found themselves in housing court. DSS already has access to all the information that is required to determine household eligibility for various grants and subsidies. These programs include EAF, EAA, ESNA, FHEPS, City FHEPS, and the new Rental Assistance Program that was included in the governor’s budget. DSS should immediately add staff in housing court to screen tenants for eligibility and help relieve caseholds. Suspend Repayment Requirements for One-Shot Deals For the remainder of the emergency and recovery, the State should suspend One-Shot Deal repayment requirements in section 131-w of the NYS Social Law. These rules that require tenants repay rent arrears grants within a year regardless of whether the grants for which they apply actually require repayment, an unnecessary requirement that deters eligible New Yorkers from applying for grants that could keep them in their homes. Expedite ERAP Applications The NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance must expedite Emergency Rental Assistance Program applications for all pending non-payment cases. The courts are able to identify which cases have an ERAP stay and should help OTDA expedite the determination on those applications. The courts should also work with the City to ensure that those who are ERAP eligible have filed applications, intervening so that tenants can stay in their home and avoid eviction when possible. Fully Fund Local Law 53 The City must fully fund Local Law 53, which requires the office of Civil Justice to work with community groups to educate tenants about their rights in housing court. The City should also better fund tenant representation in housing court by increasing baseline funding for tenant representation. Housing court cases are funded at approximately 70% of the cost of representing New Yorkers. That rate should be increased to 100% so that organizations providing services to New Yorkers can afford to retain the legal, social work, and administrative talent required to do this essential work. Convene a Council to Address Systemic Challenges The City and State should immediately convene an emergency council comprised of representatives from the courts, the City, the State, and legal representatives, as well as tenant and legal advocates, to address systemic challenges facing the right to counsel program and identify long-term solutions that ensure every tenant receives access to legal representation while also ensuring that cases are heard in a timely and fair manner.

The pandemic-induced explosion in online shopping has led to 2.4 million packages transported and delivered to residents and businesses throughout the five boroughs every day, with Manhattan receiving by far the highest concentration of these deliveries per square mile. The unregulated last-mile delivery system currently being used by delivery services exacerbates congestion, road safety issues, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, package waste, and various other quality-of-life concerns in Manhattan and throughout the city. And it’s only getting worse. Online shopping is not going away, so we must be forward-thinking and take action now to counter the negative environmental, health, safety, economic, and quality-of-life issues currently associated with e-commerce delivery. Produced by my office, A Blueprint for Tackling the E-Commerce Delivery Challenge offers a series of common-sense, actionable recommendations – that can be implemented immediately and over the coming years – to truly make e-commerce delivery greener, safer, and more efficient. These recommendations include expanding the use of e-cargo bikes as a substitute for trucks, creating curbside loading zones in every neighborhood, beefing up enforcement of illegal parking violations in loading zones, and exploring utilizing our waterfront for cargo delivery and staging.

But across the city, these sheds, built to comply with local law inspection and repair requirements, are too often left up for months, or even years. Over 230 scaffoldings across the city have been up for over five years. On average, sidewalk sheds are on city streets for 498 days, negatively impacting local businesses and neighborhood quality of life. Sidewalk sheds provide critical protection to pedestrians and their use remains essential in New York City. But we must be proactive in ensuring that they are up only for the duration of time required to perform needed work or inspection safely and not used to delay repairing dangerous façades. Strategy 1: Provide support for buildings who need help getting work done quickly Strategy 1: Sidewalk sheds and scaffolding are erected to keep New Yorkers and workers safe, and will stay up as long as an unsafe condition exists on the side of a building. But some buildings struggle to complete work quickly, due to the availability of resources and materials, to financial trouble, or permitting complications. To address this, the MBPO proposes: Provide low-interest loans to buildings struggling to complete façade work and comply with Local Law 11 requirements  Many times, sidewalk sheds that are up for a long time are a result of a building’s inability to afford extensive repairs. The State should pass legislation to allow the City to run a low-interest loan program for qualifying buildings with a demonstrated financial hardship – HDFCs, buildings participating in affordable home ownership programs, non-profits and rent regulated buildings – that provides financing for façade repair work as well as protections and prevailing wages for workers. Create an accelerator program for property owners/boards struggling to make decisions about construction, financing, engineering, and LL11 compliance broadly Construction, repair, financing, project management and compliance with the law can be complicated, and some property owners and boards lack the expertise to quickly and efficiently get work done. NYC DOB should launch an accelerator program that provides property owners and boards with access to expertise and guidance so that façade work can be done as quickly as possible.  Strategy 2: Reduce delays caused by permitting requirements and disputes with neighboring properties Strategy 2:  Serious delays can be caused by permitting complications – particularly in historic districts – and by conflicts between neighboring property owners. These delays can set projects back months, or even years, meaning sidewalk sheds are erected but no work is actually done. To address this, the MBPO proposes: Expedite façade permitting processes at Landmark Preservation Commission by expanding the staff available and dedicating a unit specifically to Local Law 11 compliance Landmarked buildings and buildings in historic districts have to go to LPC before they go to DOB for permits. As a result, sidewalk sheds that are required for safety reasons are often erected well before façade work is even permitted to begin. Any delays at LPC and DOB could add many months to a project. Allow property owners to petition for access to neighboring properties when necessary The State should allow for mediated negotiation between property owners when access to neighboring properties is required, rather than court intervention. Conflicts between property owners can seriously delay the start of a project, but mediation could help ensure that façade inspections and repairs are done as quicky as possible so that scaffolding can be taken down Strategy 3: Hold buildings accountable for failure to complete façade work in a timely manner Strategy 3: Some buildings choose to keep sidewalk sheds and scaffolding up rather than make necessary repairs. Others fail to get the appropriate paperwork, and others fail to complete work quickly for other reasons. These buildings should be better held accountable. To accomplish this, the MBPO proposes: Create a task force to identify why the City is among the worst offenders of long term scaffolding deployment, and identify how to correct those challenges The City is among the worst long-term scaffolding offenders. On average, sidewalk sheds are up for over a year on City-owned property, a truly unacceptable length of time. Increase fines and civil penalties on buildings who fail to quickly complete work DOB recently increased civil penalties, which resulted in improved in behavior from some problematic buildings. However, the borough remains buried in scaffolding, and those fine schedules should be increased again. Exercise emergency powers to perform work on buildings that fail to correct unsafe conditions DOB has the authority to direct the City to perform emergency work on unsafe buildings, the cost of which is added as a lien to the property. DOB should exercise this authority where buildings fail to correct unsafe facade conditions after a fixed period.  Create a program to assist tenants who suffer from long-term scaffolding deployment  Tenants living in buildings where scaffolding is deployed for an extended period of time may be entitled to rent abatements for decreased services. The City should provide support to rent-regulated tenants in filing for rent abatements and also offer support to market-rate tenants who withhold rent based on excessive scaffolding timeframes.  Strategy 4: Update Local Law 11 inspection regulations and reform design standards Strategy 4: Sidewalk sheds are a growing problem in New York City, and we need to reform both design standards and regulations to ensure neighborhood quality of life is maintained while also keeping pedestrians and workers safe. To accomplish this, the MBPO proposes: Allow drones to be used for façade inspection Drone technology could greatly improve the speed and efficiency of conducting façade inspections, but those drones are not allowed for Local Law 11 compliance. Introduction 452-2022, championed by Council Member Keith Powers, would allow for these technologies to be used, thereby providing a way for inspections to be conducted throughout the compliance period and help speed up the work Qualified Exterior Wall Inspectors must do. Reform design standards to allow use of different designs and scaffolding types The vast majority of sidewalk sheds and scaffolding utilize the same designs that have been in place for decades, while one company is allowed to use the popular but expensive “Urban Umbrella” style. DOB should reform design standards to allow for additional types of scaffolding and sidewalk sheds that could better fit the needs of local communities, including designs affixed to the side of a building as well as scaffolding that is higher above street level. Additionally, more companies should be allowed to utilize white paint, and reforms should be made to encourage better and brighter lighting. Strategy 5: Extend Local Law 11 compliance cycles in certain instances Strategy 5: Buildings are required by Local Law 11 to be inspected every five years regardless of how much work has been done to the façade. This incentivizes buildings to do as little work as possible each cycle to keep costs down and still pass inspections.  Extend LL11 cycles by two years for buildings that complete major façade renovations DOB should develop a program to allow buildings that undergo major renovation and façade work to go into a 7 year cycle immediately following renovations. This would encourage buildings to get extensive work completely done, and could reduce the need for sidewalk sheds to be erected in the following years.  Extend inspection schedules for new buildings made with lower risk materials Not all buildings have the same risk of façade damage or deterioration, particularly new buildings made with materials other than terra cotta. The LL11 inspection cycle should be extended from 5 years to 7 for the first two inspection cycles after a building has been constructed.

We rank 93rd out of the 100 largest U.S. cities in public bathrooms per capita, well behind cities like Columbus, Ohio! While the topic of NYC’s notorious lack of public restrooms sounds like something for the stage of a comedy club, it is actually an issue of equity, public health, sanitation, transportation, and basic human rights. It touches on almost every aspect of social policy in our city. Our lack of public bathrooms is a failure of our government on the most basic level. It shouldn’t be this way. It doesn’t have to be this way. New York City must and can do better. Our advocacy has been working. Recently, the Mayor announced that in the next five years, NYC Parks will be building and refurbishing 82 public restrooms, including 28 new public restrooms in Manhattan. The City will also be establishing a joint task force to site and approve 14 new high-tech, self-cleaning automatic public toilets on city streets and plazas. And the City just introduced a new Google Maps layer that New Yorkers can activate on their phones to easily find the locations of every public restroom operated by the City’s public libraries, NYC Parks, DOT, MTA, and civic institutions citywide. Click here, or see the bottom of the page, for the public restrooms available in Manhattan right now! This builds on the work our office has done to pass legislation with Council Member Rita Joseph to expand access to public bathrooms and ensure their accessibility: Intro 258/Local Law 114 of 2022 : This law requires the City to find at least one feasible location for a new bathroom in every ZIP code. The law also requires the City to work with Community Boards and the public about new bathroom locations and submit their report to the Mayor and Speaker of the City Council no later than December 31, 2023 with the identified location in each ZIP code. Intro 576/Local Law 144 of 2023 : Requiring the City to inspect and issue a report on the conditions, features and current status of existing public bathrooms, and to make this information readily available on the open data portal and a website run by the City. Intro 576/Local Law 144 of 2023 We also have pushed successfully for the reopening of subway station restrooms and have urged officials to ensure New Yorkers know how to find the now 121 reopened restrooms across 63 stations in the NYC subway system, including through increased signage in stations, indicating bathroom locations on digital displays and in automated announcements, and more. And we aren’t done yet — the legislative fight continues! Alongside our partner Council Member Rita Joseph, we have introduced two additional bills to help create and maintain more public bathrooms in NYC. This includes: Intro 267 : Requiring the City to open A.D.A. accessible bathrooms in publicly owned buildings across the City. Bathrooms that are on public property and paid for by taxpayers should be open to the public. Plain and simple. Intro 272 : Requiring the City to develop a capital funding plan for the bathrooms that were identified in each zip code.

The adopted City budget details how the City will responsibly spend taxpayer money for programs and services such as education, public safety, social services, health, housing, and economic development. Given the size and diversity of New York City, the budget process involves taking limited resources and attempting to address the many needs of our communities through discussion and prioritization. This process involves the Mayor, City Council, Borough Presidents, and other elected officials. To learn more about the City budget process, please read the following guides provided by the Independent Budget Office (IBO): Understanding the New York City Budget Roadmap to the New York City Budget Process A Guide to the Capital Budget For a list of FY 23 awards to nonprofits, cultural organizations and city agencies, click here . For a list of FY 23 awards to Manhattan schools, click here . For a list of FY 25 awards to nonprofits, cultural organizations and city agencies, click here . For a list of FY 25 awards to Manhattan schools, click here . As part of the process, the Manhattan Borough President has the New York City Charter-mandated authority to: Recommend modifications to the Mayor’s Prelim. Budget. Borough Presidents may propose modifications to the preliminary budget as the Borough President deems to be in the best interest of the Borough, taking into consideration the priorities of our Community Boards and the Borough Board, and testimony received at public hearings. Any recommended increases in spending within a borough must be accompanied by an equivalent recommended reduction so that the dollar amounts offset and the recommendation does not require an increase in spending over the preliminary budget. Submit a Borough Board Budget Priorities Report. It is Charter mandated that each Borough President submit a comprehensive statement on the budget priorities of the borough to the Mayor, City Council, and Director of Management and Budget. The Charter also requires that public notice be given to solicit input and recommendations from the public regarding the budget needs of the Borough. Make recommendations to the Executive Budget. Each Borough President can submit a response to the Mayor’s Executive Budget. Such responses indicate which of the recommended appropriations submitted by the Borough President, which were not included by the Mayor in the Executive Budget, should be considered by the City Council for inclusion in the budget. Again, any recommended increases in the Executive Budget must be accompanied by recommending offsetting reductions in other appropriations within the Borough, so that it does not require an increase in spending. Allocate capital funding. As part of the City Budget, five percent of the total City Capital appropriations are allotted to the Borough Presidents for use within their Borough; this amount is allocated among the Boroughs by a formula based on an equal weighting of factors relating to the population and geographic area of each Borough. This funding is then awarded by the Borough President through the Capital Grant Program. Beyond the authority to allocate capital funding through the Capital Grant Program, the Manhattan Borough President has two additional programs that provide support to nonprofits, cultural organizations, and public schools. For more information, click here. Provide Manhattan Community Awards. The Manhattan Community Award Program (MCAP) provides small funding awards – typically between $5,000 and $7,500 – to nonprofit organizations and public schools to help support programming expenses. Each award is contracted through one of four City agencies – the Department for the Aging (DFTA), the Department of Correction (DOC), the Department of Education (DOE), or the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Proposals must relate to the specific agency’s overall mission and goals. For FY 23, Manhattan Borough President Levine funded a pilot initiative by setting aside $50,000 to support composting programs throughout Manhattan. For more information, click here. Fund Manhattan Cultural Tourism Grants. Each year, New York City & Company Foundation funds and administers the Manhattan Cultural Tourism Grant designed to support cultural-tourism marketing and audience-development initiatives that will expand awareness of the various neighborhoods throughout the borough of Manhattan.

Defaced, obstructed, and fraudulent license plates are plaguing New York City’s streets, posing a serious challenge to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. License plates that are scratched out, obscured by tinted or reflective license plate covers, or altogether fake make detecting and penalizing ghost cars nearly impossible. As the City and State increasingly rely on cameras for the enforcement of speed, tolls, curb management, and more, the proliferation of fraudulent and defaced plates severely compromises the enforcement of traffic laws and collection of tolls.

As the City and State increasingly rely on cameras for the enforcement of speed, tolls, curb management, and more, the proliferation of fraudulent and defaced plates severely compromises the enforcement of traffic laws and collection of tolls. Each month, more than 5% of vehicles passing through speed cameras, red light cameras, and toll stations operated by the NYC Department of Transportation, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority are unreadable. Over 100k license plate images passing through DOT-operated cameras alone are unreadable every month. In total, there are hundreds of millions of dollars in tickets, fines, and tolls from enforcement cameras that go unpaid for such things as speeding, running red lights, and evading tolls every year.

Revenue from this new toll will be used by the MTA to fund improvements to the reliability, accessibility, and sustainability of our public transit system. This first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program in the most transit-accessible city in the country is a much-needed effort to cut gridlock and reduce people’s reliance on private cars, but the success of congestion pricing will depend on ensuring that the details of program design and implementation, as well as coordinated and proactive transit investments from the City and State, are thoughtfully deployed. Here’s what you need to know: What’s happening right now? On November 20, 2023, the Transit Mobility Review Board (TMRB) issued recommendations for base tolls, different prices based on vehicle type, nighttime discounts, and credits for if drivers are entering the CBD from a tolled tunnel, while balancing the need for the program to raise $1 billion per year in transit funds. Access their full report here . The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) is accepting public comment on the proposed tolls through March 11, 2024. There are many ways to submit comments and the MTA will be reviewing all comments equally regardless of how they are submitted.

What’s next? After the completion of the public comment period on March 11, 2024, the TBTA will review all comments and weigh if they will make any changes to the TMRB’s recommendations. They will then issue a final decision before beginning toll collection. The MTA has not yet made a final decision about when toll collection will start. In Summer 2022, Borough President Levine announced a number of priorities to ensure that the tolling program was successful. These included: Implement All-door Boarding on Buses Citywide All-door boarding, which generally reduces the time buses spend at stops by 20%, must be in place prior to congestion pricing to ensure we have the best bus system possible to carry additional riders. Raise the Pedal-assist Citi Bike Cap DOT should raise the cap (20%) on the number of pedal-assist bikes allowed to comprise the Citi Bike system. E-bikes are an increasingly popular and important transit mode for New Yorkers, particularly those who travel long distances to and from uptown as well as Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens. Implement Two-way Tolling and Make Tolls Variable Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach to tolling, capturing both sides of the trip could allow for flexibility to appropriately toll different types and sizes of vehicles, as well as encourage travel during off-peak hours. Offer Immediate Rebates to Those who are Eligible In the current plan, individuals who earn under $60,000 will receive a tax credit at the end of the year. Those who qualify should instead receive an immediate rebate so that families who earn the least aren’t forced to wait to get their money back. DOT Must Produce a 2023 Streets Master Plan Focused on Readying our Streetscapes for Congestion Pricing Successful implementation of congestion pricing will require a comprehensive transit infrastructure plan. DOT must produce a 2023 streets plan focused on bus, bike, and pedestrian improvements in and around the congestion zone, with particular focus on improvements that will better support and encourage public transit and safety and ensure the success of the congestion pricing program. Appoint a Manhattanite to the Traffic Mobility Review Board (successful) Though Manhattanites will be greatly impacted by congestion pricing, there is no requirement for there to be a resident from the area in which this program will be implemented. This is a highly complex program that must be designed with voices from Manhattan at the table.

The FDR viaduct, a relic from the Robert Moses era, no longer embodies our city’s values and vision for the future. By integrating modern transit designs, public spaces, and enhanced waterfront access, we have an unparalleled opportunity to change the face of Lower Manhattan.  Daily travel on the FDR is vastly reduced South of the bridge, with only 40% the number of vehicles traveling between the BK Bridge and Battery Tunnel as travel between East Houston and the bridge. The proposal has been met with broad approval from various elected officials, civic organizations and community leaders, including Senator Brian Kavanagh (D-NY), Council Member Chris Marte (D-NY), Assemblymember Grace Lee (D-NY), Transportation Alternatives, the Seaport Museum, Gotham Park, Financial District Neighborhood Association and the Regional Plan Association.

Nowhere is this more evident than in mom-and-pop shops, who perhaps suffered the biggest blow during this crisis. Despite a rebounding economy,  many of these small businesses continue to struggle, and many of them desperately need access to capital now. That is why the Office of the Manhattan Borough President has partnered with the Hebrew Free Loan Society to offer $2 million in interest-free loans to small businesses that have faced financial hardship during the pandemic. This Manhattan Small Business Booster Loan Program will supercharge small businesses and entrepreneurs that are still struggling to bounce back by offering up to $50,000 in zero-interest loans that can be used toward things like equipment, rent, utilities, salaries, marketing, and so much more. This program will be a vital lifeline to people who cannot access commercial credit and will help business owners focus on growing their products, services, and creative endeavors that make Manhattan one of the commercial epicenters of the world. The Hebrew Free Loan Society is a non-sectarian lender, so you do not need to be affiliated with Judaism to participate in the loan program. If you’re a small business owner or entrepreneur who might benefit from this loan, we strongly encourage you to apply. You can learn more on this page , or you can contact our office for assistance at 212-669-8300 or info@manhattanbp.nyc.gov .

As Manhattan Borough President, Mark Levine is not just talking change – he's making it happen. His impact is felt across the borough, from expanding green spaces for cooler, healthier neighborhoods to securing millions in interest-free loans for small businesses. Tackling the most pressing issue facing New Yorkers today – the housing affordability crisis – Mark proactively identified key development areas in his groundbreaking "Housing Manhattanites" report. He's also fast-tracking affordable housing projects and pushing for policies that ensure everyone has a place to call home. He has been a fierce defender of tenants' rights, championing New York City's Right to Counsel law – the first of its kind in the nation – which guarantees free legal counsel to tenants facing eviction. Mark recognizes that quality of life also means addressing everyday needs. He championed legislation to expand and improve access to public restrooms in the city, culminating in the passage of two bills in the City Council and the adoption of new measures by the Mayor's office. This citywide initiative aims to ensure that all New Yorkers and visitors have access to safe and hygienic facilities. In addition, Mark launched the "Shed the Shed" initiative to tackle the proliferation of sidewalk sheds in Manhattan. Understanding the negative impact these structures have on businesses and pedestrians alike, he is working tirelessly to streamline the process for removing unnecessary sheds and ensuring that necessary ones are well-maintained and aesthetically pleasing. Mark has been at the forefront of combating the growing threat of antisemitism in the borough and beyond, working to create the Office of Hate Crime Prevention and advocating for stronger legal protections against hate crimes. His dedication to advocating for Democratic candidates in the borough was exemplified by his 2022 campaign, "Wake Up Dems!" This initiative was instrumental in rallying voters in Manhattan to protect the Democratic majority in New York State. A forceful opponent of the MAGA movement nationwide, Mark has used his platform to promote Democratic values and candidates who stand against divisive and harmful policies. Mark's unwavering commitment to a more equitable, resilient, and affordable Manhattan underscores his vision for a city where every resident can thrive. Sign up to receive news and updates.
