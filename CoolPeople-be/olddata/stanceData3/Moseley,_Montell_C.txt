With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor Start Now Start Now   I' April 8, 2025 Dear Ms. Moseley, Thank you for taking the time to share your views regarding America’s role on the world stage. Every day, my Administration is proudly advancing policy that puts our citizens, our values, and our Nation first.  When our country is strong, the world is safe—and Americans are secure, prosperous, and free, providing a new era of peace and prosperity worldwide. On the first day of my term—to protect our Nation’s strength, safety, and success—I signed an Executive Order directing my Secretary of State to ensure that all policies, programs, personnel, and operations at the Department of State defend America’s interests and champion the needs of the American people.  I also ordered an immediate 90-day pause on foreign aid so my Administration can ensure that every American tax dollar spent on foreign assistance advances our interests, reflects our values, and safeguards our security. As President, I remain steadfastly committed to modernizing our military, bolstering our alliances, and improving our diplomatic capabilities.  My Administration is working to restore our military readiness, purge the illegal and divisive DEI ideology from the ranks of our Armed Forces, and deploy a next-generation missile defense shield to protect our Nation. Another critical part of defending America’s standing in the world is putting American workers, farmers, and businesses on a level playing field and eliminating our economic dependence on foreign countries.  To achieve this goal, my Administration is prioritizing domestic production and balancing trade through the use of tariffs and increasing domestic manufacturing.  For far too long, poorly negotiated trade deals have crippled American workers by allowing foreign nations to flood our markets with cheap goods while hollowing out our manufacturing base here at home.  This great betrayal of our Nation is finally over—and American workers and manufacturers will soon be thriving and flourishing like never before. As President, I will never stop fighting for the needs of our citizens and our homeland.  Over are the days of war, poverty, and weakness—and I look forward to working together to usher in a new dawn of American safety, prosperity, and peace. Thank you again for writing.  May God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America. Sincerely, You may follow President Trump and the White House on Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube.

Let's be direct about where we stand today. Too many New Yorkers are being priced out of their neighborhoods. When 3.5 million housing applications flood our affordable housing lottery each year, that's not just a statistic – it's a crisis. Families are choosing between rent and food. Young professionals are couch-surfing because they can't afford studios. Seniors wonder if they'll have to abandon communities they've called home for decades.

The current system fails when millions compete for a handful of units. But we need to be smart about this. I've seen how private companies sometimes exploit Section 8 programs, selling dreams to unsuspecting tenants. These companies aren't losing money – they're often looking for ways to replace low-income residents with middle-class tenants. We'll close these loopholes and protect our most vulnerable residents.

With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor With gratitude and determination, Montell Moseley, Candidate for Mayor Start Now Start Now   I' April 8, 2025 Dear Ms. Moseley, Thank you for taking the time to share your views regarding America’s role on the world stage. Every day, my Administration is proudly advancing policy that puts our citizens, our values, and our Nation first.  When our country is strong, the world is safe—and Americans are secure, prosperous, and free, providing a new era of peace and prosperity worldwide. On the first day of my term—to protect our Nation’s strength, safety, and success—I signed an Executive Order directing my Secretary of State to ensure that all policies, programs, personnel, and operations at the Department of State defend America’s interests and champion the needs of the American people.  I also ordered an immediate 90-day pause on foreign aid so my Administration can ensure that every American tax dollar spent on foreign assistance advances our interests, reflects our values, and safeguards our security. As President, I remain steadfastly committed to modernizing our military, bolstering our alliances, and improving our diplomatic capabilities.  My Administration is working to restore our military readiness, purge the illegal and divisive DEI ideology from the ranks of our Armed Forces, and deploy a next-generation missile defense shield to protect our Nation. Another critical part of defending America’s standing in the world is putting American workers, farmers, and businesses on a level playing field and eliminating our economic dependence on foreign countries.  To achieve this goal, my Administration is prioritizing domestic production and balancing trade through the use of tariffs and increasing domestic manufacturing.  For far too long, poorly negotiated trade deals have crippled American workers by allowing foreign nations to flood our markets with cheap goods while hollowing out our manufacturing base here at home.  This great betrayal of our Nation is finally over—and American workers and manufacturers will soon be thriving and flourishing like never before. As President, I will never stop fighting for the needs of our citizens and our homeland.  Over are the days of war, poverty, and weakness—and I look forward to working together to usher in a new dawn of American safety, prosperity, and peace. Thank you again for writing.  May God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America. Sincerely, You may follow President Trump and the White House on Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube.

Let's be direct about where we stand today. Too many New Yorkers are being priced out of their neighborhoods. When 3.5 million housing applications flood our affordable housing lottery each year, that's not just a statistic – it's a crisis. Families are choosing between rent and food. Young professionals are couch-surfing because they can't afford studios. Seniors wonder if they'll have to abandon communities they've called home for decades.

The current system fails when millions compete for a handful of units. But we need to be smart about this. I've seen how private companies sometimes exploit Section 8 programs, selling dreams to unsuspecting tenants. These companies aren't losing money – they're often looking for ways to replace low-income residents with middle-class tenants. We'll close these loopholes and protect our most vulnerable residents.

Because the vacancies are being filled mid-term, a special election process was utilized for selecting the candidates who will represent the major parties. This means that the county parties – in some cases the county party leader alone – selected the nominee for each seat.
