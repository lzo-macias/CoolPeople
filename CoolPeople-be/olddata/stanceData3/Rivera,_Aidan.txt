The son of a public school teacher and NYC peace officer, Aidan knows that New York City is abandoning working class families across the city, and especially on the North Shore. He's running because he loves Staten Island and every piece of our vibrant community, and refuses to allow his community to be forgotten.

Shot on his way home from high school in 2012, his family knew what it meant to feel unsafe. Like so many young people on the North Shore already know, the threat of violence is a real one when you're living in "the forgotten borough". He worked with local representatives City Councilmember Debi Rose on the Safe Zones Program and the Ceasefire Initiative to combat gun violence and curb violence overall. He also became a certified Peer Mediator, helping his fellow students resolve conflicts peacefully. This was when he learned how important community is and how effective it can be.
