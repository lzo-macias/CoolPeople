The Electoral College resulted from this debate. Historical Highlight February 01, 1877 The electoral vote count of the 1876 presidential election Electoral College Fast Facts Established in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, the Electoral College is the formal body which elects the President and Vice President of the United States. Each state has as many "electors" in the Electoral College as it has Representatives and Senators in the United States Congress, and the District of Columbia has three electors. When voters go to the polls in a Presidential election, they actually vote for the slate of electors who have vowed to cast their ballots for that ticket in the Electoral College. Electors Most states require that all electoral votes go to the candidate who receives the most votes in that state. After state election officials certify the popular vote of each state, the winning slate of electors meet in the state capital and cast two ballots—one for Vice President and one for President. Electors cannot vote for a Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate who both hail from an elector’s home state. For instance, if both candidates come from New York, New York’s electors may vote for one of the candidates, but not both. In this hypothetical scenario, however, Delaware’s electors may vote for both New York candidates. This requirement is a holdover from early American history when one of the country’s major political fault lines divided big states from small states. The founders hoped this rule would prevent the largest states from dominating presidential elections. /tiles/non-collection/i/i_electoralcollege_electoralcontestprint_2005_218_008-2.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The contested 1876 Presidential election brought Senators, and the electoral certificates under investigation, into the House Chamber. Maine and Nebraska employ a “district system” in which two at-large electors vote for the winner of the state’s popular vote   and one elector votes for the popular winner in each congressional district. Although it is not unconstitutional for electors to vote for someone other than those to whom they pledged their support, many states, as well as the District of Columbia,  “bind” electors to their candidate using oaths and fines. During the nineteenth century, “faithless electors”—those who broke their pledge and voted for someone else—were rare, but not uncommon, particularly when it came to Vice Presidents. In the modern era, faithless electors are rarer still, and have never determined the outcome of a presidential election. There has been one faithless elector in each of the following elections: 1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1988. A blank ballot was cast in 2000. In 2016, seven electors broke with their state on the presidential ballot and six did so on the vice presidential ballot. Procedure Since the mid-20th century, Congress has met in a Joint Session every four years on January 6 at 1:00 p.m. to tally votes in the Electoral College. The sitting Vice President presides over the meeting and opens the votes from each state in alphabetical order. He passes the votes to four tellers—two from the House and two from the Senate—who announce the results. House tellers include one Representative from each party and are appointed by the Speaker. At the end of the count, the Vice President then announces the name of the next President. With the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution (and starting with the 75th Congress in 1937), the electoral votes are counted before the newly sworn-in Congress, elected the previous November. The date of the count was changed in 1957, 1985, 1989, 1997, 2009, and 2013.
Sitting Vice Presidents John C. Breckinridge (1861), Richard Nixon (1961), Al Gore (2001), Mike Pence (2021), and Kamala Harris (2025), all announced that they had lost their own bid for the Presidency. Objections /tiles/non-collection/i/i_electoral_college_electoralcount1913_2008_069_000_1.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The House and Senate met in a Joint Session on February 12, 1913, to count Electoral College votes for the 1912 presidential election. Since 1887, 3 U.S.C. 15 has set the method for objections by Members of Congress to electoral votes. During the Joint Session, lawmakers may object to individual electoral votes or to state returns as a whole. An objection must be declared in writing and signed by at least one Representative and one Senator. In the case of an objection, the Joint Session recesses and each chamber considers the objection separately for no more than two hours; each Member may speak for five minutes or less. After each house votes on whether to accept the objection, the Joint Session reconvenes and both chambers disclose their decisions. If both chambers agree to the objection, the electoral votes in question are not counted. If either chamber opposes the objection, the votes are counted. Objections to the Electoral College votes were recorded in 1969 , 2005, and 2021. In all cases, the House and Senate rejected the objections and the votes in question were counted. Amending the Process Originally, the Electoral College provided the Constitutional Convention with a compromise between two main proposals: the popular election of the President and the election of the President by Congress. /tiles/non-collection/i/i_electoral_college_photo_1953_hc_2008_130_30.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The 1953 electoral vote count declared Dwight D. Eisenhower the winner. Prior to 1804, electors made no distinction between candidates when voting for president and vice president; the candidate with the majority of votes became President and the candidate with the second-most votes became Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment—proposed in 1803 and ratified in 1804—changed that original process, requiring electors to separate their votes and denote who they voted for as President and Vice President. See Electoral College and Indecisive Elections for more information. The District of Columbia has had three electors since the Twenty-third Amendment was ratified in 1961. There have been other attempts to change the system, particularly after cases in which a candidate wins the popular vote, but loses in the Electoral College. Five times a candidate has won the popular vote and lost the election. Andrew Jackson in 1824 (to John Quincy Adams); Samuel Tilden in 1876 (to Rutherford B. Hayes); Grover Cleveland in 1888 (to Benjamin Harrison); Al Gore in 2000 (to George W. Bush); Hillary Clinton in 2016 (to Donald J. Trump). The closest Congress has come to amending the Electoral College since 1804 was during the 91st Congress (1969–1971) when the House passed H.J. Res. 681 which would have eliminated the Electoral College altogether and replaced it with the direct election of a President and Vice President (and a run off if no candidate received more than 40 percent of the vote). The resolution cleared the House 338 to 70, but failed to pass the Senate. /tiles/non-collection/i/i2_electoral_college_pass_hc_2007_203_00.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object This pass for the Electoral College's 1937 vote count was used again the same day for the President's annual message. Contingent Elections In the case of an Electoral College deadlock or if no candidate receives the majority of votes, a “contingent election” is held. The election of the President goes to the House of Representatives. Each state delegation casts a single vote for one of the top three contenders from the initial election to determine a winner. Only two Presidential elections (1800 and 1824) have been decided in the House. Though not officially a contingent election, in 1876, South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana submitted certificates of elections for both candidates. A bipartisan commission of Representatives, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices, reviewed the ballots and awarded all three state’s electoral votes to Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, who won the presidency by a single electoral vote. See Electoral College and Indecisive Elections for more information on Contingent Elections.

Thirty-six ballots were required to break the deadlock, with Jefferson's election as President and Burr's as Vice President on February 17. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution to prevent the 1800 problem from recurring. 2 During most of the period while the Capitol was being reconstructed following the fire of 1814, the Congress met in the "Brick Capitol," constructed on the site of the present Supreme Court building. This Joint Session took place in the Representatives' chamber on the 2d floor of the building. 3 The Joint Session to count electoral votes was dissolved because the House and Senate disagreed on Missouri's status regarding statehood. The Joint Session was reconvened the same day and Missouri's votes were counted. 4 Although Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by a substantial amount and had the highest number of electoral votes from among the several candidates, he did not receive the required majority of the electoral votes. The responsibility for choosing the new President therefore devolved upon the House of Representatives. As soon as the Senators left the chamber, the balloting proceeded, and John Quincy Adams was elected on the first ballot. 5 The contested election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden created a constitutional crisis. Tilden won the popular vote by a close margin, but disputes concerning the electoral vote returns from four states deadlocked the proceedings of the Joint Session. Anticipating this development, the Congress had created a special commission of five Senators, five Representatives, and five Supreme Court Justices to resolve such disputes. The Commission met in the Supreme Court Chamber (the present Old Senate Chamber) as each problem arose. In each case, the Commission accepted the Hayes' electors, securing his election by one electoral vote. The Joint Session was convened on 15 occasions, with the last on March 2, just three days before the inauguration. The legislative day of February 1, 1877 lasted until formal adjournment at 4:12 AM on March 2, 1877. 6 With the ratification of the 20th Amendment, the electoral votes were counted in January by the newly sworn-in Congress, elected the previous November. 7 Vice President Humphrey was overseas attending the funeral of Trygve Lie, the United Nation’s first secretary general and did not preside over the Joint Session. The Joint Session to count electoral votes was dissolved so that the House and Senate could resolve the dispute regarding a ballot from North Carolina. The Joint Session was reconvened the same day and the North Carolina vote was counted. 8 Due to a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, the counting of the Electoral College votes was interrupted at 2:19 PM and resumed at 9:02 PM. As a result, the legislative day of January 6, 2021, lasted until a formal adjournment at 3:48 AM on January 7, 2021.

A century ago, William Tyler Page , an innovative Clerk with decades of experience in the House, held the first new-Member orientation, what one observer called a “training school” for first-term legislators. Page had lived through the chaos that followed the 1914 elections, when nearly 120 new Members-elect―many of whom had never served in public office―descended upon the House and overwhelmed the modest number of congressional staff with inquiries about routine business. With that struggle in mind, Page hosted the House’s first formal orientation in the spring of 1921. Roughly 120 Representatives-elect of the 67th Congress (1921–1923) gathered in what is now the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room . One newspaper described it as a “school for rookie congressmen.” In this forum, and in subsequent orientations, the Clerk discussed the House’s daily rhythms and spent several hours fielding questions: How do I get recognized on the floor? Do Members have priority to obtain and distribute gallery tickets ? What are the uses of official stationery and the franking privilege? Can you please explain the travel-reimbursement process? May I bring a wardrobe trunk into my office? Can a Member eat lunch in the Speaker’s Lobby ? Why are there mice in the House Office Building ? Does the House hire an exterminator? Over time, the orientation experience has evolved considerably. Today, the Committee on House Administration, House Officers, and House leadership conduct new-Member orientation shortly after each general election. Over the course of a busy week, Members-elect learn the basics about everything from voting on the floor to setting up a congressional office. Since 1921 the aim of orientation has been the same: to provide Members-elect with 
an introduction to the unique legislative processes and traditions of the House as well as the resources available to them and their congressional offices. This booklet (PDF) , which was debuted during orientation for the 116th Congress, provides some fundamentals about the House’s history, its people, geography, artwork, and proceedings. /tiles/non-collection/1/1-orientation_LC.xml Image courtesy of the Library of Congress Clerk William Tyler Page, speaking here to Members-elect in 1927, devised an orientation program for new Members in 1921.

Congress Overview President James Monroe’s annual message to the 18th Congress (1823–1825) warned Europe against interfering with Western Hemisphere nations—a foreign policy agenda known today as the Monroe Doctrine. Speaker Henry Clay outlined a plan for a national system on internal improvements (roads, canals, harbors). When no candidate won a majority of the Electoral College in 1824, the House—as required by the Constitution— elected John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson who had received more popular votes. When Adams named Clay his Secretary of State, the Jacksonians charged that a “corrupt bargain” had decided the election.

McCormack (left) and Sergeant at Arms Kenneth R. Harding (center) stand with awardee, Superintendent of the Radio-Television Gallery Robert M. Menaugh (right), during the McCormack award ceremony in 1972. Behind the group is a plaque displaying the names of previous recipients. The McCormack Award, created in December 1970, is named for longtime Speaker John W. McCormack of Massachusetts. McCormack served as a Member in the House from 1928 until his retirement in 1971, serving as Majority Leader before holding the Speakership for the last nine years of his career. /tiles/non-collection/m/mccormack_award_PA2019_03_0038.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object (From left to right) Speaker Carl Albert , Jeannette Petinaud (Ernest Petinaud's wife), awardee and House Restaurant Head Waiter Ernest Petinaud, and Sergeant at Arms Kenneth R. Harding , pose during the 1973 McCormack award ceremony. The award recognizes longtime House employees who have displayed bipartisanship and dedication to the institution. For several years after his retirement, McCormack returned to the Capitol to personally make the award presentations. “I traveled these corridors for 42 years and they mean a lot to me,” he recalled during one such ceremony. “I’ve always been touched by the actions of employees. There has always been an affection between the employees of this House and myself—one I shall always treasure.” 1 Early in its existence, a committee composed of House Officers and senior staff chose the honorees; in modern practice, House leaders select awardees. For the first decade of the award’s existence the House bestowed it annually. After the late 1980s, however, it was awarded more intermittently. The first individual to be honored with the McCormack Award was Lew Deschler , the longtime House Parliamentarian who, over nearly half a century, served nine different Speakers from Nick Longworth to Carl Albert. Names and position titles listed are as printed on the physical plaque.

The political future of the Kansas and Nebraska territories dominated House and Senate debate, and in May 1854, President Franklin Pierce signed into law the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The new legislation effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1819–1820 and guaranteed the right to “popular sovereignty,” enabling voters in the territories to determine the legality of slavery. Northern Members also opposed calls by their Southern colleagues and the President to run the transcontinental railroad through the heart of the South.

Congress Overview Jacksonian Democrats controlled the 24th Congress (1835–1837), which regulated the state banks that replaced the Second Bank of the United States, and routinized operations in the Post Office Department. After an abolitionist campaign began flooding Congress with antislavery petitions, the House responded by automatically tabling such petitions without consideration. Antislavery Members, including John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, undertook efforts to repeal the “gag” rule denouncing it as a violation of their constituents’ right to freedom of speech. Adams’ fervent opposition almost led to his censure.

first woman to serve in Congress, a total of 449 women have served as 
U.S. Representatives, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, or Senators. This website, based on the publication Women
 in Congress , contains biographical profiles of former women 
Members of Congress, links to information about current women Members, 
essays on the institutional and national events that shaped successive 
generations of Congresswomen, and images of each woman Member, including
 rare photos. "Women Must Be Empowered": The U.S. House of Representatives and the Nineteenth Amendment [PDF] House Joint Resolution 1 was one of more than 1,200 pieces of legislation introduced on Opening Day of the 66th Congress (1919–1921), May 19, 1919. Most were mundane; H.J. Res. 1 was anything but. Read the story of how the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 19th Amendment. Member Profiles Read biographical profiles of former women Representatives, Delegates, and Senators that focus on their congressional careers. These profiles also contain suggestions for further reading and references to Members’ manuscript collections. Women in Congress: An Introduction Early in the afternoon on May 21, 1919, Representative James Robert Mann of Illinois called up the first measure of the 66th Congress (1919–1921), House Joint Resolution 1. Widely known as the Susan B. Anthony amendment, H.J. Res. 1 was named for one of America’s foremost women’s rights champions. "I'm No Lady; I'm a Member of Congress," 1917–1934 The era of women in Congress began on April 2, 1917, when Montana’s Jeannette Rankin was sworn in as a Member of the House of Representatives. In August 1920, three months before the 1920 elections, the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote was added to the Constitution. Millions of women voted for the first time that fall. Onto the National Stage, 1935–1954 Thirty-six women entered Congress for the first time between 1935 and 1954, a tumultuous two decades that encompassed the Great Depression, World War II, and the start of the Cold War. Women participated in America’s survival, recovery, and ascent to world power in important and unprecedented ways; they became shapers of the welfare state, workers during wartime, and members of the military. A Changing of the Guard, 1955–1976 The third generation of women in Congress—the 39 individuals who entered the House of Representatives and the Senate between 1955 and 1976—legislated during an era of upheaval in America. Overlapping social and political movements during this period encouraged more and more women to enter politics and provided valuable experience for a new group of feminist reformers. Assembling, Amplifying, and Ascending, 1977–2020 Early in the afternoon on January 4, 2007, Nancy Pelosi of California walked down the center aisle of the U.S. House of Representatives and climbed the few steps to the top of the rostrum amid a roar of applause. Moments earlier, she had been elected the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House.

Congress Overview The fallout from the war with Mexico rocked the 31st Congress (1849–1851). Mexico’s massive land cession to the United States precipitated a major sectional crisis over slavery in the new territory. Sectionalism in the House prevented the election of a Speaker for three weeks at the opening of the Congress. This relegated the House to a secondary role during the crisis. The focus instead turned to the Senate which initiated a complicated package of nine bills—known as the Compromise of 1850. The legislation made an arduous and tangled journey to congressional passage in the fall of 1850. The fallout from the war with Mexico rocked the 31st Congress (1849–1851).

Rainey: 150 Years of Black Americans Elected to Congress Joseph Rainey of South Carolina embarked on his remarkable House career in December 1870: he became the first African-American Representative, the first Black man to preside over the House, and the longest–serving African American during the tumultuous Reconstruction period. Rainey and his nineteenth-century colleagues blazed a path followed by more than 160 Black Members to date—despite the barriers thrown up by the legacy of slavery and the rise of Jim Crow. To celebrate Rainey’s milestone, this page provides ready access to teaching materials, oral histories, biographies, documents, artifacts, that tell the 150-year history of African Americans in Congress.

Rainey’s Biographical Profile Born into slavery, Joseph Rainey was the first African American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, the first African American to preside over the House, and the longest–serving African American during the tumultuous Reconstruction period. “We Are In Earnest For Our Rights”: Representative Joseph H. Rainey and the Struggle for Reconstruction [PDF] Joseph Rainey, who became the first African-American Representative in December 1870, navigated a unique path from slave to citizen to Representative. An ardent defender of Black civil and political rights, Rainey directly challenged the calcified traditions of American politics and society. The Long Struggle for Representation: Oral Histories of African Americans in Congress To commemorate Joseph Rainey's election, the Office of the Historian has conducted oral histories with African-American Members, staff, and family. The interviews in this ongoing project provide firsthand accounts of the African-American experience on Capitol Hill since the 1950s—a period of dramatic change when Black Members were able to build seniority, shape legislation, and secure leadership positions. Joseph Rainey: 150th Anniversary Exhibition The Joseph Rainey: 150th Anniversary exhibition in the U.S. Capitol celebrates the pathbreaking accomplishment of Joseph Rainey. The exhibition opened in the House Connecting Corridor of the U.S. Capitol in December 2020. Joseph H. Rainey Election Certificate This election certificate confirmed Joseph Rainey’s 1874 election to the 44th Congress (1875–1877) for a third full term. Joseph H. Rainey’s Portrait The portrait of Joseph Rainey, the first African American elected to the House of Representatives, was unveiled in 2005. Black Americans in Congress, 1870–2022 For more than 150 years, Black men and women have won election to Congress despite having to overcome formidable, ever-changing barriers to Black political participation. The story of Black Americans in Congress is not confined to Capitol Hill. It is a national story of electoral triumphs and discouraging setbacks, hard-won victories and long periods of political exclusion.

Following the ratification of the Articles of Confederation , which created a limited central governing structure, Delegates from the states met in the Confederation Congress (1781–1789) to chart a path forward with their newfound freedom. When the Articles of Confederation proved unable to meet the needs of the young country, states sent Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 to draft a new, stronger governing document, creating the United States of America and its federal legislature, including the House of Representatives. Meet the People of the Continental and Confederation Congresses Learn biographical information and obtain bibliographical information for all 366 Members of the Continental and Confederation Congresses. Presidents of the Continental Congresses and Confederation Congress, 1774–1789 When the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, the Delegates elected a presiding officer to oversee the revolutionary legislature’s sessions. Given the title of “president,” this officer held several important parliamentary responsibilities and acted as the “first member” of the Continental Congress. Meeting Places for the Continental Congresses and the Confederation Congress, 1774–1789 The Continental Congress was an itinerant legislature, often moving to escape British forces during the Revolutionary War. All told, Delegates met in nine different locations between 1774 and 1789. Delegates of the Continental and Confederation Congresses Who Signed the United States Constitution One of the legacies of the Continental and Confederation Congresses was the convening of the Federal Convention of 1787. Listed here are the 34 Continental and Confederation Congress Delegates who signed the United States Constitution.

This website, based on the publication Black Americans in Congress , contains biographical profiles of former African-American Members of Congress, links to information about current Black Members, essays on institutional and national events that shaped successive generations of African Americans in Congress, and images of each individual Member, supplemented by other historical photos. Black Americans in Congress: An Introduction For more than 150 years, Black men and women have won election to Congress despite having to overcome formidable, ever-changing barriers to Black political participation. The story of Black Americans in Congress is not confined to Capitol Hill. It is a national story of electoral triumphs and discouraging setbacks, hard-won victories and long periods of political exclusion. “The Fifteenth Amendment in Flesh and Blood:” 1870–1901 Twenty Black Representatives and two Black Senators served in Congress between 1870 and 1901. Each displayed a formidable array of skills as a lawmaker, orator, and activist. They pursued ambitious reforms while diligently working to protect the interests of their constituents. Exile, Migration, and the Struggle for Representation: 1901–1965 Explore the many contradictory experiences of Black Americans on and off Capitol Hill during the first six decades of the twentieth century, a period marked by migration and the struggle to overcome political exclusion. Permanent Interests: 1965–1990 From 1965 to 1990, the number and influence of African Americans in Congress increased significantly. Black Representatives worked to win seats on powerful committees, and some attained roles in Democratic leadership. Power and Diversity: 1990–2022 As more Black Members won election to Congress, often from safe districts, they composed an ever-greater proportion of the membership of the Democratic Caucus. This afforded Black Members the chance to rise in party leadership in committees and within the caucus. Member Profiles Read biographical profiles of former African-American Representatives, Delegates, and Senators that focus on their congressional careers. These profiles also contain suggestions for further reading and references to Members’ manuscript collections. "We Are In Earnest For Our Rights": Representative Joseph H. Rainey and the Struggle for Reconstruction [PDF] Joseph Rainey, who became the first African-American Representative in December 1870, navigated a unique path from slave to citizen to Representative. An ardent defender of Black civil and political rights, Rainey directly challenged the calcified traditions of American politics and society.

He revived the original practice of addressing Congress in person and shepherded major legislation to passage: tariff and anti-trust reform, the creation of the Federal Reserve System, and the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission. The outbreak of World War I in Europe, though, threatened the future of reform. Democrats controlled the 63rd Congress after sweeping the 1912 elections.

The Constitution mandates the office, but since the early 19th century the House and the individual Speakers have continually redefined its contours. Rooted in British parliamentary practice, the early Speakers limited their roles to presiding over the House and serving as its ceremonial head. There have been 56 people who have served as Speakers of the House. /tiles/non-collection/h/hh_1789_03_04_muhlenberg_hc.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania was elected the first Speaker of the House on April 1, 1789. Over time, some Speakers aggressively pursued a policy agenda for the House while others have, in the words of Speaker Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, “come to this chair to administer [the] rules, but not as a partisan.” Regardless, the Speaker—who has always been (but is not required to be) a House Member with the same obligations to his or her constituents like the other 434 Members—is at the levers of power. The Speaker is simultaneously the House’s presiding officer, party leader, and the institution’s administrative head, among other duties. The Speaker is elected at the beginning of a new Congress by a majority of the Representatives-elect from candidates separately chosen by the majority- and minority-party caucuses. These candidates are elected by their party members at the organizing caucuses held soon after the new Congress is elected. In cases of an unexpected vacancy during a Congress a new Speaker is elected by a majority of the House from candidates previously chosen by the two parties. The Speaker of the House is by law second in line to succeed the President, after the Vice President, and 25th Amendment makes the Speaker a part of the process announcing presidential disability. Including Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a total of 56 Representatives have served as Speaker. Seven individuals have served nonconsecutively: Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, Henry Clay of Kentucky, John W. Taylor of New York, Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Sam Rayburn of Texas, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, and Nancy Pelosi of California.

Congress Overview A divided government complicated legislative work during the 112th Congress (2011–2013). Unable to reach deals on a number of issues, the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic Senate passed emergency measures to prevent a government shutdown and avoid defaulting on the country’s debt. After long talks between the Speaker and the President, a “grand bargain” of tax hikes and spending cuts collapsed, leaving a Senate bill to raise the debt ceiling. A House-Senate panel tasked with reducing deficits failed to outline a plan, triggering a series of automatic spending cuts called sequestration.

Congress Overview Republican infighting disrupted the 61st Congress (1909–1911), as Speaker Joseph Cannon of Illinois made only limited committee appointments until President William Howard Taft’s priority tariff bill passed. Cannon then made the bulk of committee assignments depending on how Members voted on the tariff. A coalition of insurgent Republicans and Democrats formed to break Cannon’s power by removing the Speaker from the Rules Committee and shifting the power to assign Members to the committee. Despite the House conflict, Congress passed the 16th Amendment authorizing an income tax. Other progressive legislation regulated campaign financing and the transportation and communications industries.

The House Historian tells the story. Florence Kahn: Congressional Widow to Trailblazing Lawmaker In 1925, Florence Prag Kahn succeeded her late husband Julius in a San Francisco-based U.S. House seat. Most early congressional widows served as temporary placeholders until party leaders chose long-term, male successors. But Kahn was no ordinary political widow. With an insider’s knowledge of House operations and a gift for turning a phrase, she set herself to “attending to business”—expanding the Bay Area’s infrastructure and military installations during her 12-year career, while blazing a trail for women seeking political office.

Congress Overview The 71st Congress confronted the worst economy in American history. During a special session called by the new President Herbert Hoover, the Republican-controlled Congress responded to the long-term agricultural recession with the Agricultural Marketing Act. Congress enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff after the October 1929 stock market crash. The tariff raised the prices of imported goods and further exacerbated a worldwide economic downturn as international trade collapsed. Congress also established the Veterans’ Administration as an independent agency and adopted Francis Scott Key’s “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national anthem.

Congress Overview The 34th Congress struggled to open as the House took two months and 133 ballots to elect a Speaker by a plurality instead of the customary majority. As pro- and antislavery supporters killed one another in the “Bleeding Kansas” territory, the conflict in the West quickly spilled into Washington as the Senate backed Kansas’s proslavery constitution, while the House favored an antislavery version after a committee investigation revealed widespread voter fraud. After Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner vehemently denounced proslavery Members, Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina beat him senseless with a cane on the Senate Floor.

Congress Overview Tariff politics dominated the 22nd Congress (1831–1833). Increasing Southern complaints over the 1828 “ Tariff of Abominations ” prompted passage of a revision in 1832. Still disgruntled, South Carolinians championed nullification, a doctrine that would allow each state to judge the constitutionality of federal laws. In response, Congress passed a Compromise Tariff in 1833 and authorized the military to uphold it. A Whig effort to renew the Second Bank of the United States before its charter expired provoked a veto from President Andrew Jackson —the first veto in American history based on policy rather than on legal grounds.

A House of Representatives officer from 1789 to 1995, the Doorkeeper was elected by a resolution at the opening of each Congress. The Office of the Doorkeeper was based on precedent from the Continental Congresses. Without debate, the First Federal Congress (1789-1791) created the Doorkeeper’s position by resolution on April 2, 1789. The Doorkeeper controlled access to the House Chamber and eventually oversaw the press in the gallery. A total of 35 individuals served in the Doorkeeper position until it was terminated in the 104th Congress (1995-1997) and many of its duties were transferred to the Sergeant at Arms, the Clerk of the House, and the newly created Chief Administrative Officer.

Article I, section 7 of the Constitution grants the President the authority to veto legislation passed by Congress. This authority is one of the most significant tools the President can employ to prevent the passage of legislation. Even the threat of a veto can bring about changes in the content of legislation long before the bill is ever presented to the President. The Constitution provides the President 10 days (excluding Sundays) to act on legislation or the legislation automatically becomes law. There are two types of vetoes: the “regular veto” and the “pocket veto.” The regular veto is a qualified negative veto. The President returns the unsigned legislation to the originating house of Congress within a 10 day period usually with a memorandum of disapproval or a “veto message.” Congress can override the President’s decision if it musters the necessary two–thirds vote of each house. President George Washington issued the first regular veto on April 5, 1792. The first successful congressional override occurred on March 3, 1845, when Congress overrode President John Tyler’s veto of S. 66. The pocket veto is an absolute veto that cannot be overridden. The veto becomes effective when the President fails to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned and is unable to override the veto. The authority of the pocket veto is derived from the Constitution’s Article I, section 7, “the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case, it shall not be law.” Over time, Congress and the President have clashed over the use of the pocket veto, debating the term “adjournment.” The President has attempted to use the pocket veto during intra- and inter- session adjournments and Congress has denied this use of the veto. The Legislative Branch, backed by modern court rulings, asserts that the Executive Branch may only pocket veto legislation when Congress has adjourned sine die from a session. President James Madison was the first President to use the pocket veto in 1812.

Congress Overview Democrats maintained control of Congress and also the White House after President Franklin Roosevelt’s unprecedented election to a third term in 1940. The European war consumed Congress’s attention. The Lend–Lease Act allowed the U.S. to provide supplies to Great Britain, while the peacetime draft was extended by one vote in the House. But after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the 77th Congress declared war on the Axis Powers. Legislation quickly followed to mobilize the country, generate greater revenues, and impose price controls.

Beginning in 1934, the convening date for Congress became January 3 (unless Congress by law appoints a different day), and beginning in 1937 the starting date for the presidential term became January 20.

Moments of great significance have taken place when the two houses hold such meetings. This chart lists those occasions where Congress meets as a single body since the First Congress (1789–1791). Joint Meetings or Joint Sessions? The parliamentary difference between a Joint Meeting and a Joint Session has evolved over time. At present, the distinctions have these features: A Joint Meeting takes place when the House and Senate agree to recess and meet with the other chamber. The purpose of a joint meeting has usually been for Congress to hear an address from an important figure—generally a visiting foreign leader. This practice became a standard part of foreign leaders’ state visits to the United States after 1945. A Joint Session takes place when the House and Senate adopt a concurrent resolution. Joint Sessions typically are reserved to hear an address from the President of the United States or to count presidential electoral votes as specified by the U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 1; 12th Amendment). On January 6, 1941, two Joint Sessions were held the same day: to count the presidential electoral votes and to hear President Franklin Roosevelt deliver his Annual Message to Congress. The Speaker of the House of Representatives usually presides over Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings; however, the President of the Senate presides over Joint Sessions where the electoral votes are counted, as required by the Constitution (Article I, section 1; 12th Amendment). The Annual Message and the State of the Union Address The Constitution states that the President will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient” (Article II, section 3). For the first decade of the national government Presidents appeared in person before a Joint Session of Congress to deliver their annual messages. Beginning with Thomas Jefferson in 1801, Presidents sent the Annual Message in writing to be read by House clerks and Senate secretaries respectively. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson resurrected delivering the Annual Message in person to a Joint Session of Congress. Beginning with the 80th Congress (1949–1951) the appearance of the President to deliver the Annual Message has been termed the “ State of the Union Address .” Electoral Count and Presidential Inaugurations The House and Senate also come together in ways important to the President. The Constitution specifies that all presidential electoral votes are counted “in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives” with the President of the Senate presiding (Article II, section 1; 12th Amendment). The electoral count has taken place without problems save for the disputed electoral votes challenged in 1877 when a special Electoral Commission made up of Representatives, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices reviewed the disputed ballots. Congress has hosted inaugurations since the first occasion in 1789. Inaugurations have always have been formal joint gatherings, and sometimes they also were joint sessions. Inaugurations were Joint Sessions when both houses of Congress were in session, and they processed to the ceremony as part of the business of the day. In many cases, however, one or both houses were not in session or were in recess at the time of the ceremony. In this table, inaugurations that were not Joint Sessions are listed in the second column. Those that were Joint Sessions are so identified and described in the third column. Fast Facts When Congress met in New York City from 1789–1790, joint gatherings were held in the Senate Chamber in Federal Hall. While Congress met in Philadelphia from 1790–1799, it met in Congress Hall. Joint gatherings were initially held in the Senate Chamber from 1790 to 1793. Beginning in 1794, the Hall of the House of Representatives in Philadelphia’s Congress Hall hosted joint gatherings of Congress. After the Capitol moved to Washington in 1800, the Senate Chamber was used for joint gatherings through 1805. Since 1809, with few exceptions, Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings have occurred in the Hall of the House. From France’s Marquis de Lafayette’s address in 1824 through Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo in 1977, the House of Representatives often invited foreign dignitaries to address the chamber in what was known as a House Reception. In the modern era, the practice of using one-chamber receptions largely disappeared. For more information, please visit, Foreign Leaders and Dignitaries Who Have Addressed Congress .

Congress Overview The 1874 elections put Democrats in control of the House for the first time since the eve of the Civil War. The 44th Congress impeached the Secretary of War for bribery, and investigated both the President’s private secretary for defrauding the government and the reckless speculation which squandered the life savings of formerly enslaved people. In January 1877 Congress created a special commission to divvy up disputed Electoral College votes from the previous fall’s presidential election. The Electoral Commission awarded all of the disputed votes to Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes , who became President by one electoral vote.

Congress Overview With the outbreak of war in Europe President George Washington—with the 3rd Congress’ support—famously declared U.S neutrality. The problems abroad threatened America’s trade, however, and Congress was forced to create the U.S. Navy in order to protect the nation’s merchants from the Barbary Pirates off Africa’s Mediterranean coast. Following the Jay Treaty with Great Britain, partisan rancor erupted again; many in Congress charged the administration with prioritizing commercial and diplomatic relations with England. On the domestic front, the anti-tax sentiment that spawned the “Whiskey Rebellion” in western Pennsylvania became a powerful influence in the formation of the country’s political parties.

Nearly 7,000 Representatives had served before Rankin—all had been men. Her remarkable election in 1916 occurred four years before women had the right to vote nationally, and blazed a path followed by nearly 400 women to date. To celebrate Rankin’s milestone, this page provides ready access to teaching materials, oral histories, biographies, documents, artifacts, that tell the 100-year history of women in Congress. Jeannette Rankin's Biographical Profile Jeannette Rankin’s life was filled with extraordinary achievements: she was the first woman elected to Congress, one of the few suffragists elected to Congress, and the only Member of Congress to vote against U.S. participation in both World War I and World War II. “I may be the first woman member of Congress,” she observed upon her election in 1916. “But I won’t be the last.” "Women Must Be Empowered": The U.S. House of Representatives and the Nineteenth Amendment [PDF] House Joint Resolution 1 was one of more than 1,200 pieces of legislation introduced on Opening Day of the 66th Congress (1919–1921), May 19, 1919. Most were mundane; H.J. Res. 1 was anything but. Read the story of how the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 19th Amendment. Oral History: A Century of Women in Congress Jeannette Rankin’s pioneering career opened the door for hundreds of women to follow her into Congress. To commemorate the centennial of her election and swearing-in, watch interviews with former women Representatives, staff, and family members who reflect on Rankin and the role women have played in Congress during the past century. The First Women in Congress Exhibit Through art, historic artifacts, and archival documents, learn more about the early generation of women Representatives’ impact on the significant legislative issues of the period—women’s suffrage, veterans and the military, and the government’s response to the needs of citizens. Women in Congress, 1917–2020 Based on the publication Women in Congress , this exhibition contains biographical profiles of former women Members of Congress, links to information about current women Members, essays on the institutional and national events that shaped successive generations of Congresswomen, and images of each woman Member, including rare photos.

Standing with a cane, Stevens reads the House’s message. Fast Facts “The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” — U.S. Constitution, Article II, section 4 The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach an official, and it makes the Senate the sole court for impeachment trials. “The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” — U.S. Constitution, Article II, section 4 The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach an official, and it makes the Senate the sole court for impeachment trials. On February 21, 1868, when the United States House of Representatives met as it usually did at noon, there was no sense that the long-simmering struggle between Congress and President Andrew Johnson was about to tip into a full-blown constitutional crisis. After gaveling in and lazily dispensing with a handful of private relief bills, the House settled into a long debate on the annual naval appropriations bill. “The calm of the forenoon had been nigh unto sluggishness,” a New York reporter observed. 1 But by midafternoon a low murmur rippled across the House Floor when several Representatives darted in with shocking news they had just heard while visiting the Senate Chamber. Within minutes Speaker Schuyler Colfax announced that the House had received several communications from the executive branch. All of them were routine, except one—a letter from the embattled Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton—that had sparked the commotion in the Senate, the gist of which was now spreading by word of mouth across the House Chamber. Stanton had forwarded a curt order from President Johnson that he had received that morning from General Lorenzo Thomas. In it the President summarily informed Stanton that he was “hereby removed from office.” Thomas, a feckless desk officer, would act as the interim Secretary. 2 Johnson’s decision to fire the Secretary of War was not a routine personnel decision, however. By replacing a Cabinet member without first consulting Congress, the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act, a law meant specifically to curtail Johnson’s unilateral exercise of power. Johnson’s decision to remove Stanton came after nearly three years of conflict between the White House and Congress. Johnson, a Senator from Tennessee when the Civil War broke out in 1861, had remained loyal to the Union. Nevertheless, he was a Democrat and slaveholder who wanted to readmit the former Confederate states to the Union with few conditions. Congress, meanwhile, was controlled by Republicans—many of whom were northern abolitionists—with a very different vision for the future of the country. Among those Republicans, a small but influential and vocal faction of Radical Republicans had taken steps to commandeer the party’s agenda in the late 1860s. The Radicals hoped that from the ashes of the Civil War would rise a new nation, one built on a foundation of racial tolerance and equal opportunity. Johnson, however, had routinely circumvented Congress, issuing an almost blanket amnesty proclamation that reconstituted the political rights for former Confederates across the South. The President also wielded his veto pen with devastating efficiency to stymy the Republicans’ legislative agenda—known as Congressional Reconstruction—when he assumed office after President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865. With the former Confederacy under martial law, Stanton was pivotal to Congressional Reconstruction plans; as Secretary of War, Stanton controlled the military forces keeping the peace in the South. But with Stanton gone—and with Johnson having already re-enfranchised the very rebels who had tried to overthrow the federal government during the Civil War—the President believed he had the support to withdraw the Union Army from the South and put into place his far more lenient policies. If Johnson succeeded, he would also be risking the lives of millions of emancipated black men and women who, without federal protection, would be subject to the abuses of their former masters. 3 /tiles/non-collection/h/house_chamber_stereoview_2005_159_000-4.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The House Chamber, seen here in 1868, served as the backdrop as Members debated impeachment in late 1867 and early 1868. When the House learned Johnson had removed Stanton, Radical Republicans were momentarily stunned and unusually subdued by the news. This, however, was not the first time Johnson had attempted to fire Stanton. Johnson had tried something similar a few months earlier during a long congressional recess, but the Senate ultimately forced the President to return the seat to Stanton. Few imagined the President would defy Congress directly and replace Stanton again. Elihu Washburne of Illinois, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, for instance, simply moved that Stanton’s communication be referred to the Select Committee on Reconstruction , which the House had created in July 1867 to ensure that the Johnson administration adhered to the blueprint Congress laid out for the readmission into the Union of the former Confederate states. Washburne then steered the House back to naval appropriations. /tiles/non-collection/h/house_chamber_stereoview_2005_159_000-4.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The House Chamber, seen here in 1868, served as the backdrop as Members debated impeachment in late 1867 and early 1868. But as the gravity of Stanton’s letter sank in, Radicals found it difficult to think about anything else, and halted work on the naval spending bill that afternoon as Representatives chatted and milled about the chamber. Some consulted law books. Others expressed disbelief that the President had acted so recklessly. When news of Stanton’s removal reached Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, the ailing Radical leader hurried to the chamber to whip Members who had previously shrunk from confronting Johnson directly. A brooding and caustic abolitionist, Stevens chaired the Reconstruction Committee and was in effect the Republican floor leader in the House. Leaning on the arm of a moderate leader, John Bingham of Ohio, Stevens shuffled among the small knots of Members conversing on the floor, striking the same refrain to anyone within earshot. “Didn’t I tell you so?” he demanded. “What good did your moderation do? If you don’t kill the beast, it will kill you.” 4 “We have, it appears, two Secretaries of War, one by law and one by usurpation,” bellowed the fiery Radical Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts, a first-term Member and former major general in the Union Army, who had earned the moniker “Beast Butler” for his iron-fisted rule of occupied New Orleans during the Civil War. Butler demanded that the next morning—a Saturday, originally set aside to celebrate the birth of George Washington—be reserved to discuss what Johnson had done, and which laws he had violated. 5 As the House voted to approve Butler’s motion, Maine’s Frederick Pike —a moderate up to that point—shouted, “Up now, all who are for impeachment!” En masse, Republicans rose to their feet. Butler walked up to Pike with a broad smile on his face and patted the Mainer on the back. 6 As tensions quickly escalated in the House, Pennsylvania’s John Covode reached into his desk and pulled out a small sheet of paper he had kept there for months. Demanding to be recognized for a privileged question, Covode commanded the floor. “I offer the following resolution,” he thundered. “ Resolved . That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.” 7 /tiles/non-collection/w/web_Covode_Impeachment_Resolution_Andrew_Johnson_HR_40A-B4.xml Image courtesy of the National Archives and Records Administration About this record The one-sentence impeachment resolution, drafted by John Covode of Pennsylvania, was referred to Stevens’s Select Committee on Reconstruction: “That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.” “The impeachers think they now have Mr. Johnson in a net from which he cannot possibly escape, and their spirits have risen in consequence,” concluded the Baltimore Sun correspondent as he looked on from the House galleries. 8 /tiles/non-collection/w/web_Covode_Impeachment_Resolution_Andrew_Johnson_HR_40A-B4.xml Image courtesy of the National Archives and Records Administration About this record The one-sentence impeachment resolution, drafted by John Covode of Pennsylvania, was referred to Stevens’s Select Committee on Reconstruction: “That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.” A moment of immense constitutional import—the first impeachment of a President in American history—had arrived.

He served two terms as Speaker of the House. Congress Overview Democrats won control of the House, but the Senate and presidency remained Republican after the 1890 elections. Nevertheless, the ambitious and cooperative 52nd Congress (1891–1893) enacted an eight-hour workday for federal blue-collar workers, mandated new safety requirements on railway companies, and renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years. In foreign policy, President Benjamin Harrison submitted a Hawaiian annexation treaty, but Congress adjourned before considering it. Despite its legislative record, this Congress failed to address the country’s mounting financial crises, and as the economy teetered on the edge of recession Populist unrest began popping up across the country.

Congress Overview The 9th Congress (1805–1807), made up overwhelmingly of Democratic Republicans, demonstrated its independence when caustic Virginia Representative John Randolph successfully delayed a secret appropriation to buy West Florida. British attacks on U.S. shipping during its war with France led Congress to pass legislation prohibiting the importation of British goods, with the assumption that the resulting economic loss would force Britain to back off. The 9th Congress also followed up on a constitutional provision (Art. I, sec. 9) and passed legislation to prohibit the importation of slaves beginning in 1808.

Congress Overview Democrats kept control of Congress in 1972 despite Republican President Richard Nixon’s landslide re-election. The 93rd Congress responded to unilateral presidential actions with the War Powers Resolution, a new federal budget process, campaign reforms, and the Freedom of Information Act. Congressional investigations implicated Nixon in widespread misconduct after a break-in at the Democratic Party’s Watergate complex offices in Washington, but Nixon resigned before the House filed articles of impeachment against him. Using the 25th Amendment for the first time, Congress twice confirmed an appointed Vice President. Congress also reorganized energy policies, reformed private pensions, and set environmental standards.

Congress Overview Missouri statehood continued to monopolize the energies of the 16th Congress (1819–1821). The first session hammered out the Missouri Compromise that admitted Missouri as a slave state, Maine as a free state, and codified Missouri’s southern boundary as the designating line between free and slave territories. In the second session, Henry Clay of Kentucky put the final touches on the Missouri Compromise after he convinced the territory’s officials to remove an offending clause in Missouri’s constitution which would have excluded all African Americans—whether slave or free—from residing in the state.

Congress Overview When Democrats retained control of the national legislature following the 1850 elections, the 32nd Congress (1851–1853) focused on linking East Coast to West through potential railroad routes to the Pacific. Despite passage of the Compromise of 1850, the nation’s sectional crisis still simmered. The antislavery bestseller Uncle Tom’s Cabin made real the horrors of fugitive slave laws. Meanwhile, southerners who feared the potential of a new free state obstructed the organization of the Nebraska Territory.

Waite /tiles/non-collection/i/im_inst_funerals_PA2011_09_0040b.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Speaker Joseph Byrns' coffin was borne into the Capitol for funeral services attended by Members of Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his cabinet, the diplomatic corps, and the Supreme Court. Under the current House Rule IV, the House Chamber may only be used for legislative functions, conference meetings, and caucus meetings unless the House agrees to take part in a ceremony. Earlier in House history, however, the Chamber also served as a place to memorialize Representatives who died in office. The United States Capitol Rotunda is known widely as a space where the nation pays tribute to its most revered citizens, whose bodies lie in state or in honor in that room. Comparatively little is known about funerals that took place in the Hall of the House. Beginning with Congressman Nathaniel Hazard of Rhode Island in 1820, the House Chamber has hosted 32 funerals for sitting Members. As time progressed, the House developed standing practices that were employed when a serving Member passed away: the announcement of the Member’s death was made on the House Floor; a resolution was made regarding the funeral; a resolution was made to don black armbands for a period of 30 days; Congress adjourned out of respect; and the House followed by hosting or attending the funeral. From the early 1800s to 1870s, many Members of the House that died in the capital city were buried in Congressional Cemetery, located in the southeast section of Washington, D.C. Of the 71 Members buried at Congressional Cemetery (six were later moved), eight had funerals in the House Chamber. In addition, 109 Members of the House are honored in Congressional Cemetery with cenotaphs—four-sided memorial stones with a name engraved on each side of the monument. Eight of the cenotaphs, including that of John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, memorialize those Members whose funerals were held in the House Chamber. The practice of the cenotaphs ended in the 1870s with the exception of two: Representatives Hale Boggs of Louisiana and Nicholas Begich of Alaska, who passed away in 1972. In cases where the late Representatives’ funerals were not held in the Capitol, Members were transported by funeral train back to their home district or a location designated by the family. A delegation from the House was traditionally appointed to attend the funeral. The House paid for the cost of the delegation’s travel and documented the outlay in the Clerk’s contingent expenses report. On occasion, what was referred to as a “state funeral” was held in the House Chamber. These state funerals generally had a specific guest list consisting of the President, Justices of the Supreme Court, Senators, and fellow House Members. Both Speaker Champ Clark of Missouri and Representative James Mann of Illinois (see photo to the right) were accorded state funerals in the chamber. With Congress and the country continuing to grow, the House agreed to set a $1,000 spending limit out of its contingent expenses to cover the cost of funerals in 1883. This was designed to put a stop to extravagant funerals, which were becoming more prevalent. In 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression, the House determined that sitting Member funerals no longer would be paid for with contingent expenses of the House. The last funeral to take place in the House Chamber was Speaker William Bankhead of Alabama in 1940. When retired, Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill of Massachusetts passed away in 1994, Congress honored the former Speaker by adorning the rostrum on the House Floor with funeral wreaths. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_inst_funerals_PA2011_09_0040b.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Speaker Joseph Byrns' coffin was borne into the Capitol for funeral services attended by Members of Congress, President Franklin D.

Congress Overview Democrats maintained large congressional majorities, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt won easy re-election in the 1936 elections. Roosevelt’s failed attempt to pack the Supreme Court with sympathetic justices helped foster a “conservative coalition” of Southern Democrats and Republicans in the 75th Congress. The House and Senate continued to pass New Deal legislation, including farm and housing loan programs and new minimum wage standards. Congress regulated crop and natural gas production, civilian aviation, and food and drug ads. The rapid escalation of hostilities in Europe and Asia convinced Congress to create a “two-ocean” navy as war appeared increasingly likely.

Election Statistics, 2020 Vacancies and Successors /tiles/non-collection/C/Chamber_PA2015_06_0082.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives The House Chamber was remodeled in 1950 and updated with electronic voting in 1972. Congress Overview Democrats retained the House majority and won control of the Senate after the 2020 elections, which also saw the election of Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. as President. On January 6, 2021, three days after the opening of the new Congress, thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol, disrupting the counting of the Electoral College Vote and injuring scores of Capitol Police and Washington Metropolitan Police officers deployed to protect the building. Lawmakers and staff fled both chambers to secure locations but returned that night to complete the certification of President-elect Biden’s election in the early morning hours of January 7. On January 13, the House impeached President Donald J. Trump on the charge of incitement of insurrection. The Senate later acquitted him. During the 117th Congress, lawmakers passed a swath of major legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, which injected $1.9 trillion in stimulus money into the economy amid the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, which, by 2022, had killed more than one million Americans; the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which directed $1.2 trillion in federal spending toward public works and infrastructure projects; the Chips and Science Act, which provided billions in subsidies for domestic semiconductor research and production; and the Inflation Reduction Act, which sought to lower the cost of prescription drugs and boost domestic energy production, investing heavily in green energy technology. In 2021, Congress approved a new federal holiday for the first time in nearly four decades: Juneteenth (June 19th), commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. Lawmakers also authorized billions in aid to Ukraine which was invaded by Russia in February 2022. Many of the House processes and rules amended in the prior Congress at the start of the pandemic—including virtual committee hearings and proxy voting—remained in place in the 117th Congress.

Related Links Edition for Educators—Football Edition for Educators—Take Me Out to the Ballgame Democratic and Republican Congressmen first faced off on the baseball diamond in 1909, in a recreational affair organized by John Tener of Pennsylvania. The game gained popularity, attracted live coverage, and became a vehicle for charitable giving. The Congressional Baseball Game has evolved into an annual institution. The tradition of bipartisan bonding through athletic competition may have begun with baseball, but in recent years Congress has taken up other sports including football, basketball, softball, soccer, and hockey. Annual events range from skill challenges to full matches, and participants have included Members of Congress, staff, press, lobbyists, and occasionally professional stars.

Congress Overview Following the retirement of Speaker John Boehner in the fall of 2015, House Republicans elected Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to succeed him in the chair for the 114th Congress (2015–2017). Operating in the shadow of the 2016 presidential election and amid tight government funding deadlines, tensions between the House and Senate remained high. The Senate passed fewer than one third of the 773 bills passed by the House. Among the major bipartisan legislative achievements of the 114th Congress were the Every Student Succeeds Act, which replaced the former federal K-12 education guidelines under No Child Left Behind, and the DRIVE (Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy) Act, a comprehensive funding agreement for transportation infrastructure through 2021.

That year, the House paid tribute to the longest-serving Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, by naming the East Front’s ornate new reception room for him. When the Rayburn House Office Building opened in 1965, the Committee on Armed Services saluted its recently retired leader, Carl Vinson , with the first named hearing room in the House. Since those first designations in the 1960s, the House has bestowed similar honors over the decades. In 1977, Ernest Petinaud , longtime head waiter in the House Restaurant and recipient of the McCormack Award , became the first staffer and first African American acknowledged with a room name.

Congress Overview Democrats controlled the 111th Congress with majorities in both houses of Congress alongside the country’s first African-American president, Democrat Barack Obama. Congress addressed the financial meltdown and subsequent global recession by clearing a stimulus package followed by comprehensive financial regulation. After months of negotiations, Democratic leadership passed a health care reform bill in a close vote that split down party lines. In its last weeks, after Republicans won the House during the 2010 election, the 111th Congress (2009–2011) renewed expiring tax cuts and repealed policies that had prevented gay Americans from openly serving in the armed forces. Other issues remained unaddressed, including deficit reduction, energy and the environment, campaign-finance reform, and regular appropriations.

Congress Overview President Franklin Roosevelt’s attempt to pack the Supreme Court and then to purge conservative Democrats from the party contributed to Democratic losses in the 1938 elections. Democrats nevertheless retained their congressional majorities, and the 76th Congress authorized the President to reorganize executive agencies and outlawed using federal employees or facilities for political purposes. The outbreak of war in Europe quickly monopolized Congress’s attention. Neutrality legislation allowed foreign governments to pay cash for supplies and ship it themselves. Congress also passed internal security measures that required foreign nationals to register with federal authorities and established the first peacetime draft.

Congress Overview The Jacksonians won control of the House and maintained control over the Senate in 1826. But like earlier, the 20th Congress (1827–1829) spent much of its legislative energy preparing for the upcoming presidential election. Andrew Jackson was summarily denigrated or praised in bill after bill. The legacy of this Congress was the “Tariff of Abominations” which drastically raised tariff rates in favor of New England and the Middle Atlantic states at the expense of the South. John Randolph of Virginia dismissed the tariff as a Jacksonian bill for “the manufacture of a President.” The Jacksonians won control of the House and maintained control over the Senate in 1826.

Congress Overview The 45th Congress (1877–1879) remained politically divided between a Democratic House and Republican Senate. President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed an Army appropriations bill from the House which would have ended Reconstruction and prohibited the use of federal troops to protect polling stations in the former Confederacy.

Congress also approved a generous increase in pension eligibility for Union veterans of the Civil War.

The Republican Whip assists the party leadership in managing the party's legislative program on the House floor. The Whip provides a communications network for the Republican members and mobilizes them for important party measures coming up for a vote. The title comes from Great Britain where the House of Commons has had party “whips” since the late 18th century. The term derives from fox hunting, where the “whipper in” is the person in charge of keeping the pack of foxhounds together. There have been 20 people who have served as Republican Whip. The first Republican Whip was James A. Tawney of Minnesota who kept track of the whereabouts of Republican members for Speaker Thomas B. Reed of Maine. With only a slim majority, Reed relied upon Tawney to let him know when bills could be brought up for vote when more Republicans were in attendance than Democrats. Since then, subsequent Whips have served as a two-way bridge between the leadership and the rank-and-file members. The Republican Whip has been an elective post for most of its history (Tawney may have been appointed by Reed). The selection usually comes during the organizing conference of Representatives-elect meeting just prior to the start of a new Congress. If the position becomes vacant during a Congress, a new Whip is elected at a subsequent conference. When in the majority, the Whip is the third highest post in the conference. When in the minority the Whip is the second highest position behind the Republican Leader. Of the 20 members who have served as Republican Whip, two later became House Speaker, another Vice President, six served as Republican Leader, and three others as Senators.

The Republican Whip assists the party leadership in managing the party's legislative program on the House floor. The Whip provides a communications network for the Republican members and mobilizes them for important party measures coming up for a vote. The title comes from Great Britain where the House of Commons has had party “whips” since the late 18th century. The term derives from fox hunting, where the “whipper in” is the person in charge of keeping the pack of foxhounds together. There have been 20 people who have served as Republican Whip. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_repwhip_2002_006_007.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Before serving as Chairman of Appropriations, James Tawney of Minnesota served as the first Republican Whip. The first Republican Whip was James A. Tawney of Minnesota who kept track of the whereabouts of Republican members for Speaker Thomas B. Reed of Maine. With only a slim majority, Reed relied upon Tawney to let him know when bills could be brought up for vote when more Republicans were in attendance than Democrats.

The earliest Congresses typically featured a large number of first-term Representatives after each election cycle because Members did not usually pursue long congressional careers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This meant that first-term Members occasionally assumed prominent roles in the House. Henry Clay of Kentucky, for instance, won election as Speaker in his first term in the House. But by the early 20th century, first-term Members were expected to go through a period of apprenticeship, learning about the House’s rhythms and procedures from more senior Members before taking on complex policies and managing legislation on the floor. As House Speaker Champ Clark of Missouri once said, “A man has to learn to be a Representative just as he must learn to be a blacksmith, a carpenter, a farmer . . . or a doctor.” 1 By the mid-20th century, first-term Members were often called “freshmen.” The table below documents the number of Representatives serving their first term for each Congress: A “pre-convening” freshman is a Member (present on Opening Day of a new Congress) who won a seat in the general election. This category also includes people who won a special election prior to the first meeting of a new Congress. This often occurred in the 19th century as Congress typically did not convene for more than a year after the states held their general elections, leaving plenty of time for Members-elect to die, accept an appointment elsewhere in the government, or decide not to serve. A “post-convening” freshman is someone who entered office mid-Congress and served a partial term. This includes those who won a special election after Congress convened, those who successfully contested an election, and Members whose office was established mid-Congress, such as when a new state is admitted to the Union.

The officers’ duties are prescribed both by law and Rule II of the Rules of the House of Representatives. Postmasters of the House /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_postmasters_2004_086_001.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The 1857 expansion added an elegant new post office to the Capitol. An elected officer for nearly 160 years (24th through the 102nd Congresses), the Postmaster managed mail operations in the House. Initially, workers in the Doorkeeper’s office were paid additional compensation to perform mail duties. A December 13, 1832, resolution made the Postmaster a distinct and permanent House employee. In 1834, William J. McCormick , a Doorkeeper’s employee, was named the first House Postmaster. Four years later, the House adopted a rule that charged the Postmaster with superintending the post office in the Capitol and overseeing the delivery of mail to Members and Officers. The House Reform Resolution of 1992 (H. Res. 423, April 9, 1992), abolished the Office of the Postmaster and reassigned mail handling procedures for the House of Representatives among other House Officers and private entities. A total of 21 Postmasters served in the House. One Postmaster ( William S. King ) served as a U.S. Representative after his service as a House Officer. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_postmasters_2004_086_001.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The 1857 expansion added an elegant new post office to the Capitol.

Congress Overview Democrats won the White House and the Senate, and added to their House majority after the landslide 1932 election. The 73rd Congress passed an extraordinary burst of legislation to combat the immediate economic chaos of the Great Depression during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office.

Other prominent agencies created during this period endure: the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission.

Congress Overview The Republican majority in the Senate eroded and the Democratic majority in the House declined after the 1886 election. President Grover Cleveland fought the 50th Congress (1887–1889) on a number of different legislative fronts and wound up vetoing more than 200 bills (mostly private pensions). He got little help from fellow Democrats in lowering the tariff and none from congressional Republicans calling for higher protectionist rates. Congress established an independent Department of Labor in 1888 and a Cabinet-level Department of Agriculture in 1889.

Related Collection Object Oscar Wilder Underwood Majority Leaders of the House (1899 to present) /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_majleader_2002_021_019.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Sereno Payne of New York chaired the Ways and Means Committee before becoming the House's first Majority Leader. The House of Representatives, with its large membership, has relied on Majority Leaders since the late-19th century to expedite legislative business and to keep their parties united. There have been 26 people who have served as Majority Leader. In the three decades following the Civil War, when America’s current two-party system crystalized, the concept of the Majority Leader was far more informal than it is today. At the time, the majority party depended on powerful committee chairmen—either from the Ways and Means Committee or the Appropriations Committee—to pull double duty as both chairman and as the majority’s legislative conductor on the House Floor. That began to change on the eve of the 20th century. Although the earliest party leaders continued to serve as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, historians and congressional scholars tend to agree that the Majority Leader became “a separate and consistently identifiable party office” in 1899, according to Randall B. Ripley in his study Party Leaders in the House of Representatives . Initially, the Majority Leader was an appointed position, chosen by the Speaker . In 1899, Speaker David B. Henderson , a nine-term Republican from Iowa, selected Sereno Payne of New York to shoulder the responsibilities of serving as both Ways and Means chairman and Republican floor leader. When Democrats captured the majority following the 1910 elections, the party caucus maintained that dual arrangement, so that from 1899 to 1919, regardless of the party in power, whoever served as Ways and Means chairman also served as Majority Leader. In 1919, following the example set by Republican Leader Frank Mondell of Wyoming in the 66th Congress (1919–1921), Majority Leaders more or less stopped serving on committees. With Democrats in charge of the House for the 62nd Congress (1911–1913), they made one significant adjustment to the office that remains in effect today: hoping to limit the power of the Speaker, Democrats made the Majority Leader an elected position. In 1911, Democrat Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama became the first Member elected by his party to serve as Majority Leader. Republicans began electing Majority Leaders in conference in 1923.  

Since 1899, Majority Leaders have come from virtually every section of the country. No woman and no person of color has ever served as Majority Leader from either party. Today, Majority Leaders are elected every two years in secret balloting of the party caucus or conference before the start of a new Congress. The role of the majority leader has been defined by history and tradition. This
                officer is charged with scheduling legislation for floor consideration; planning
                the daily, weekly, and annual legislative agendas; consulting with Members to gauge
                party sentiment; and, generally working to advance the goals of the majority party.

Download House Rule II (PDF) . House Rule II outlines the duties of seven officers and officials: the Clerk of the House , the Sergeant-at-Arms , and the Chaplain , which all date to 1789, as well as the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) , the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the Historian, and the Office of General Counsel, all of which were created during the twentieth century. The Clerk, the Sergeant-at-Arms, the CAO, and the Chaplain are elected by the Members, while the Speaker appoints the remaining three—the Inspector General, the Historian, and the General Counsel. Two other officials, the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Office of Law Revision Counsel, are also appointed by the Speaker, but their jurisdiction comes from federal statute rather than House Rules.

Congress Overview When Democrats regained control of Congress in the 1948 elections, President Harry Truman outlined to the 81st Congress (1949–1951) the “Fair Deal,” an ambitious follow-up to New Deal programs of the 1930s. But Truman’s domestic agenda became a Cold War casualty after the Soviet Union successfully tested its atomic bomb, China came under communist control, and a Soviet spy ring was uncovered. Congress enacted internal security legislation. It also approved U.S. entry in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), anchoring an alliance intended to protect Western Europe from Soviet aggression.

Congress Overview For the first time since 1928, Republicans organized both houses of Congress and the White House. An armistice in Korea eased the need for national security legislation, and the 83rd Congress (1953–1955) dealt little with foreign policy beyond a few political asylum measures. Instead, it created the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; authorized U.S. cooperation with Canada in building the St. Lawrence Seaway; codified the internal-revenue code; and banned communists from holding any trade-union offices. Congress also addressed energy issues involving the distribution of offshore mineral rights and the development of atomic energy.

An officer of the House whose history extends back to the First Congress, the Sergeant at Arms is the chamber’s principal law enforcement official, charged with maintaining security on the floor and for the House side of the Capitol complex. The modern Sergeant at Arms serves on the Capitol Police Board and the Capitol Guide Board along with the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the Architect of the Capitol. Including William McFarland, a total of 39 individuals have served as the House Sergeant at Arms since 1789. Mandated under the current House Rule II, the Sergeant at Arms also enforces protocol and ensures decorum during floor proceedings. The Mace , which symbolizes the authority of the House, is maintained by the Office of the Sergeant at Arms. On occasion, the Sergeant at Arms has presented the Mace to restore order on the floor. The Sergeant at Arms also is empowered to compel absent Members onto the House floor to conduct business. Over time, the office’s duties have encompassed administrative functions: arranging Capitol funerals, managing parking facilities, and issuing identification to Members and staff. Eight Sergeants at Arms also served as U.S. Representatives either prior to or after their service as a House officer. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_saa_2008_033_005.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object In this print from 1881, the Sergeant at Arms escorted errant Members into the Chamber.

Congress Overview England’s war with Napoleon monopolized the attention of the 11th Congress (1809–1811) as the United States attempted to navigate between the two European powers. At President James Madison’s prodding, though, Congress tried once more to pass legislation to dissuade Europe’s main powers from impressing U.S. sailors and seizing its merchant ships. Congress simultaneously took advantage of European turmoil by authorizing the acquisition of Spanish West Florida.

Congress Overview After 14 Members-elect died between Election Day 1930 and the start of the 72nd Congress, Democrats won enough special elections to take control of a narrowly divided House. Republicans retained their Senate majority by one seat. Congress responded to the Great Depression and established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to provide loans to banks and industry, but President Herbert Hoover vetoed regional public works projects. Unemployed World War I veterans marched on the capital, but Congress refused to fast-track the “bonus” payments they had been promised. Hoover later ordered the Army to evict the veterans from their Washington camps.

Congress Overview The horror of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001—followed by the Capitol Hill anthrax attacks a month later—united the 107th Congress (2001–2003) behind a shared sense of national duty and forged momentary bipartisanship. Although both chambers were narrowly divided between Republicans and Democrats, Congress authorized the use of force in Afghanistan and Iraq, established the Department of Homeland Security, and easily passed anti-terrorism legislation.

One of the first tourist destinations in the country, the
U.S. Capitol is an icon of American democracy. Visiting the Capitol has long been a part of the American experience, and returning home with some remembrance of the trip is part of that venerable
tradition. Starting around 1820—when the Capitol was fully functional—visitors
arrived to see the impressive building and to watch their government in action.
The oldest objects included in this exhibition codify the Capitol as the seat
of government, and the United States as an established nation with impressive
sights to see. After the Civil War, the development of Washington, D.C.,
accelerated, and the variety of landmarks to visit and ways to immortalize the
trip expanded rapidly. In the 20th century, the nature of souvenirs further
expanded with the market for commercially produced objects, many of which focus
on the image of the Capitol itself and the public declaration of the visitor's
experience. Next Section /tiles/non-collection/2/2006_044_000.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Postcards of the Capitol were instantly recognizable as a memento from a Washington jaunt. One of the first tourist destinations in the country, the

Each party cohort elects its own class president, who help develop and communicate policy goals and build relationships. The term “class president” has been used since the 1980s, but freshman leaders have gone by a variety of titles over the years. 1 Edith Green of Oregon, leader of the Democratic class of 1954, for instance, was known as the president of the “84th Club,” which took its name from the 84th Congress (1955–1957). 2 At times, class leaders were also known as chairmen of the Freshman Caucus, or the New Member’s Caucus. 3 The chart below includes known freshman leaders from the Democratic and Republican parties. Only Members who served as principal class leaders are listed; Members selected to serve in secondary freshman leadership positions, such as vice president or secretary, are not included. A freshman leader’s term can vary from six months to an entire two-year Congress. 4 A freshman class can opt to elect a single president, or two co-presidents. 5 Therefore, the number of freshman leaders who have served in each Congress can vary. Due to the relatively informal nature of the position, relevant documentation can be sparse, and information for some Congresses remains unknown.

Congress Overview The steady decline of the Federalists left the 17th Congress (1821–1823) in the hands of the Democratic Republicans, but partisan triumph began giving way to political and personal factionalism. After Spain transferred the Florida territory to the U.S., Congress authorized its new territorial government, and Joseph Hernández was elected Florida’s Delegate, becoming the first Hispanic American elected to Congress. Congress also appropriated funds for diplomatic missions to the Latin American countries that had just won independence from Spain.

You will find video tours of historic rooms and spaces, some of which are not open to the public; research resources; and teaching materials that will help bring the U.S. House to your classroom. Tour the House Chamber Legislative activities in the House of Representatives begin and end in the House Chamber. The grand space in which Members meet to debate and vote on legislation was designed in the 19th century—and redesigned over the years—with these needs in mind. Tour Statuary Hall The Old House Chamber, now called Statuary Hall, is one of the most historic rooms of the U.S. Capitol. The House of Representatives met in this space from 1807 to 1857, before moving to the present House Chamber. Behind-the-Scenes Historic rooms and spaces fill all corners of the U.S. Capitol. Over time the uses of many Capitol spaces evolved to accommodate the growing size and the increasing diversity of the House. Two such rooms, the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women’s Reading Room and the Speaker’s Lobby, have long histories closely tied to the House of Representatives. Plan Your Trip Access resources that will help you plan a trip to the U.S. Capitol. Learn how to make the most of your time to help students get a first-hand look at how the House of Representatives works.

All four belonged to the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and only hours earlier had traveled from New York City to Washington, DC. The United States had annexed Puerto Rico in 1898, and the island’s relationship with the federal government had long been a point of contention. Some Puerto Ricans sought to maintain their relationship with the mainland, and others, like the four visitors in the House that day, argued for an independent Puerto Rico . The Capitol had few security protocols at the time, and the four Puerto Rican nationalists entered the gallery armed with handguns. Around 2:30 p.m. they indiscriminately opened fire onto the House Floor and unfurled a Puerto Rican flag in a violent act of protest meant to draw attention to their demand for Puerto Rico’s immediate independence. Five Congressmen were wounded in the shooting. Members, House Pages, and police officers quickly helped detain three of the assailants outside the gallery, while the fourth escaped the Capitol and was apprehended later that afternoon. /tiles/non-collection/o/oh_1954shooting-stretcher-PA2013_12_0005.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object House Pages carry a stretcher bearing a wounded Member to a waiting ambulance.

Congress Overview Gilded Age political deadlock ended with the 51st Congress (1889–1891). Republicans won control of both houses of Congress and the presidency after the 1888 election, breaking a remarkable period of divided-party government. Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine streamlined House rules and prevented the minority party from obstructing the legislative process. The rules changes and unified government produced the “Billion Dollar Congress,” as the new majority passed generous military pensions and approved long-stalled naval expansion. New economic pressures also resulted in the Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Gilded Age political deadlock ended with the 51st Congress (1889–1891).

Congress Overview The sinking of the battleship Maine in Cuba precipitated the Spanish–American War in 1898, which monopolized Congress’s attention during the 55th Congress (1897–1899). The Republican-controlled Congress quickly passed military preparedness legislation and declared support for Cuban independence. The U.S. military swiftly dispatched Spanish forces. With the Senate’s approval, the Treaty of Paris ended the war and ceded a far-flung colonial empire to the U.S.—including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines—which Congress was now in charge of administering. Congress also annexed Hawaii and passed the highly protective Dingley Tariff.

Congress Overview Democrats won control of both the 53rd Congress (1893–1895) and the White House after the 1892 elections, enabling them to repeal the Reconstruction-era Force Acts that mandated federal supervision of Southern elections. Party control, however, crumbled as the economy went into a sharp and deep downturn—8,000 businesses went bust in six months. And when champions of the gold standard responded by successfully repealing the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, Democrats split into silver and gold factions. Democrats also divided over tariff reform after Congress barely reduced national duties.

Biden, Jr.'s 2024 address, there have been a total of 100 in-person Annual Messages/State of the Union Addresses. Since President Woodrow Wilson resumed the delivery of in-person addresses in 1913, there have been a total of 88 in-person addresses. In 1945, President Franklin Roosevelt's address was read to a Joint Session of the House and Senate. Since the President did not deliver the address, it does not count as an in-person address. Origins and Authorization The formal basis for the State of the Union Address is from the U.S. Constitution: The President “shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he
                    shall judge necessary and expedient.” Article II, Section 3, Clause 1. The constitutionally mandated presidential message has gone through a few name changes: It was formally known as the Annual Message from 1790 to 1946. It began to be informally called the "state of the Union" message/address from 1942 to 1946. Since 1947 it has officially been known as the State of the Union Address. Earlier Annual Messages of the President included agency budget requests and general
                reports on the health of the economy. During the 20th century, Congress required
                more-specialized reports on these two aspects, separate from the Annual Message. Budget Message, required by the National Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (42 Stat.
                    20) to be delivered to Congress no more than two weeks after Congress convenes in
                    January. Economic Report, required by the Employment Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 23), with a flexible
                    delivery date. Over time, as the message content changed, the focus of the State of the Union also
                changed: In the 19th century, the Annual Message was both a lengthy administrative report
                    on the various departments of the executive branch and a budget and economic message. After 1913, when Woodrow Wilson revived the practice of presenting the message to
                    Congress in person, it became a platform for the President to rally support for
                    his agenda. Technological changes —radio, television, and the Internet—further developed
                    the State of the Union into a forum for the President to speak directly to the American
                    people. Technological Change First radio broadcast of Message: President Calvin Coolidge, 1923. 1 First television broadcast of Message : President Harry Truman, 1947. First televised evening delivery of Message : President Lyndon Johnson , 1965. First live webcast on Internet: President George W. Bush, 2002.

In 1918, Republicans achieved a clear majority and elected Frederick H. Gillett Speaker on the opening day of the 66th Congress (1919–1921).  See, “ The Start of the 66th Congress .” 3 Elections in the fall of 1930 had provided Republicans with a slim majority in the chamber. But between Election Day 1930 and the opening of the new Congress 13 months later, 14 Representatives-elect died.  In the subsequent special elections to fill those vacancies, Democrats won enough seats to recapture the majority.  On opening day, Democrats organized the chamber with several Members from third parties. See, “ The Opening of the 72nd Congress .” 4 The Senate in the 110th Congress (2007–2009) had 49 Democrats and 49 Republicans. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut was reelected in 2006 as an independent candidate, and became an Independent Democrat. Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont was elected as an Independent. Both caucused with the Democrats. See, United States Senate, “Party Division,” https://www.senate.gov/. 5 The State of North Carolina did not submit an election certificate for the Ninth U.S. Congressional District prior to the opening day of the 116th Congress.

Congress Overview The 21st Congress (1829–1831) signaled the beginning of Jacksonian Democracy in America, in which the general public took on a more pronounced role in government affairs. The clamor for more land and new resources led Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act, which forced American Indians from the southeast to leave their ancestral homes and resettle west of the Mississippi River. Poor planning and a lack of funding made for terrible conditions during the trek westward. The path those refugees followed became infamous as the “Trail of Tears.” The 21st Congress (1829–1831) signaled the beginning of Jacksonian Democracy in America, in which the general public took on a more pronounced role in government affairs.

The Capitol is a symbol of democracy, the meeting place of Congress, and a historic building more than 200 years old. Here, learn more about how the House of Representatives’ most significant spaces, art and historic artifacts have grown, moved and evolved with the Congress’s many changes. Statuary Hall The House met here for 50 turbulent years, debating important issues of the day: slavery, westward expansion, and more. After the House moved to new quarters in 1857, the room became National Statuary Hall. Travel back in time to when the room operated as the Old House Chamber, then jump ahead to the rich collection of statues on display today. House Chamber The House Chamber is where Members of Congress debate and pass laws. The House of Representatives first met here in 1857, and the room has continued to evolve. New technology, changing decorative tastes, and a growing nation fed this stream of innovation. Discover what changed and what stayed the same here. Gathering Spaces Getting together—with colleagues, constituents, press, staff—has long been a vital part of the legislative process. From its earliest days, the Capitol has provided for this need with a range of meeting spaces. Some, like the Members’ Dining Room, are open to all visitors. Others, like the Speaker’s Lobby, are off the beaten path. Go behind the scenes to explore the history and contents of these famous spots.

Congress Overview International anxieties blended with domestic politics as the Jay Treaty controversy continued to reverberate in the 4th Congress. The Senate approved the treaty as apprehensive Americans divided over whether Great Britain had gotten the better bargain. A hostile House sought to undercut the agreement by legislating around it, but ultimately provided the funding needed to implement the treaty. The election of Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania finally provided the House the financial expertise to critique the administration’s policies.

Congress Overview Republicans retained the Senate and White House, and Democrats maintained their House majority despite Republican gains there in the 1984 election. Concentrating on the growing deficit, the 99th Congress (1985–1987) overhauled the tax code and passed Gramm–Rudman–Hollings, which would produce automatic across-the-board spending cuts if Congress failed to agree on deficit reduction. Congress also passed limited funding for the MX missile system and aid for the Nicaraguan contras.

Congress Overview Democrats retained control of Congress with the 1966 elections, but their majorities eroded in both chambers. The Vietnam War, which drained the country’s resources and fostered massive unrest, constrained the 90th Congress (1967–1969). Congress pushed forward with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society” program, and instituted public broadcasting, made air quality a federal responsibility, prohibited housing discrimination, and increased taxes. Urban riots led to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 that imposed restrictions on gun ownership.

Congress Overview Republicans won the House and presidency while the Senate was evenly divided after the 1880 elections. The 47th Congress (1881–1883) focused on immigration: approving a treaty with China to slow the flow of Chinese laborers; passing a Chinese Exclusion Act (after an earlier one had been vetoed); and sending a general immigration act to the President. Congress also appropriated funds for river and harbor projects and for modernizing the U.S. Navy. After the trial and execution of President James A. Garfield’s assassin, a delusional job-seeker, Congress replaced the patronage system with a civil service program to hire government workers.

Congress mandated uniform dates for federal elections. After the Senate rejected a treaty to annex the Texas Republic, Congress passed the first of two joint resolutions admitting Texas to the Union.

Congress Overview The southern rebellion which followed Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency gave Republicans control of the 37th Congress (1861–1863). Congress, led by a vocal minority of Radical Republicans, backed Lincoln on nearly every legislative front: the southern naval blockade; the call for volunteers; the federal spending blitz; and the suspension of habeas corpus. Freed to act without southern obstructionism, Congress passed a long succession of bills with far-reaching consequences for the country’s growth in later decades: the establishment of an Agriculture Department, the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and the land-grant college system.

Trump in the White House. During the 115th Congress, 443 measures became law. In May 2017, the House approved legislation to “repeal and replace” the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but the bill failed in the Senate. In late 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lowering income tax rates and overhauling other parts of America’s revenue code. Congress also passed legislation modernizing copyright laws for the music industry, approved bipartisan legislation funding efforts to combat opioid addiction, and reformed the criminal justice system with the First Step Act. Because of a dispute between the White House and Congress over funding for a wall along America’s border with Mexico, the 115th Congress closed amid a lapse in appropriations for several federal agencies, leading to a partial shutdown of the government that lasted into 2019.

Affirmative Action First used in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, a policy to promote opportunities for minorities and women by favoring them in hiring and promotion in government and private jobs, college admissions, and the awarding of government contracts as a means to compensate for their historic exclusion or underrepresentation. “Aliens ineligible for citizenship” Legal term describing
those immigrants prohibited from attaining U.S. citizenship
through naturalization, e.g., Asians (U.S. legislation limited
naturalization to white individuals or African descendants).
The prohibition on Asians becoming naturalized citizens was
eliminated in stages between 1943 and 1952. Amerasian The children of U.S. military personnel and Asian
partners born outside the United States. Antebellum The era preceding a war, especially the American Civil War, 1861–1865. Annexation The action or process of joining or uniting with,
especially in the case of a nation acquiring a territory. Apportionment The allocation of congressional seats in the House of Representatives in proportion to states’ populations as tabulated by the U.S. Census Bureau every 10 years. Although federal law determines the total number of Representatives, states determine the size and boundaries of their congressional districts based on population changes revealed in the census. Archipelago A chain or cluster of islands located in the same
body of water. Assembly Center Temporary detention centers established
by the Wartime Civil Control Administration in March 1942 to
facilitate the forced evacuation of 120,000 Japanese Americans
primarily from California, Washington, and Oregon. The
evacuation of citizens and residents to the assembly centers was
completed by mid-September 1942. Asylum A secure place of refuge, shelter, or retreat. At-Large Representative In modern practice, a Representative
elected in a state that has only one seat apportioned to it in the U.S.
House. For many years states that were apportioned more than one
Representative could elect an At-Large Representative in statewide
voting even when a majority of the state delegation was elected by
single-member, geographically defined districts. Until the mid-20th
century, At-Large Representatives were often elected immediately
following decennial apportionment. At-Large elections in states with
more than one seat in the U.S. House were abolished by federal law
in 1968. Barrio A neighborhood defined by geographical location, particular feature, or history. Bicameral A legislative body having two legislative chambers
or houses. Black Panthers (or Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) An organization formed in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to monitor police activity and brutality against residents in Oakland, California. In contrast to the southern civil rights movement’s advocacy of nonviolent resistance, the Black Panthers promoted local self-help, community activism, and armed defense against the use of excessive force by police. The Black Panthers also called for the restructuring of American society to ensure social, political, and economic equality for all races. Bloody Shirt A violent event or controversial political issue used to stir up outrage or partisan support. Typically used during the late 19th century, “wave the bloody shirt” refers to the Republican Party’s use of the Civil War as justification for political revenge on former Confederates. Carpetbagger A derogatory term applied by the popular press to a Northerner who went to the South during Reconstruction to pursue economic or political opportunities. Many of these Northerners carried their belongings in carpetbags. This term is also used by observers of current political affairs to describe a person who interferes with the politics of a locality to which he or she has no permanent or genuine connection. Caucus A meeting of party members in each chamber (House
Republicans and Senate Republicans refer to their gatherings as
a “conference”). A caucus is used primarily to select candidates
for office and to consider other important business for furthering
party interests. The term also describes an organization of House
and Senate Members that is devoted to a special interest or
legislative area. Census An official count of a population that includes various
related statistics. The U.S. Constitution mandates that a
nationwide census be taken every 10 years. Chairman/Chairwoman The presiding officer of a committee, subcommittee, or other group such as a caucus. Chairs are selected by the majority party in the House and are elevated by seniority in the Senate. Committee and subcommittee chairs hire majority staff and set the committee’s schedule. Chamorro Chamorro Indigenous inhabitants of the Mariana Islands and
Guam who migrated from Southeast Asia almost 3,000 years
ago. The term also denotes a distinct Austronesian language. Chicano Used by Americans of Hispanic and/or mestizo descent in the 1960s and 1970s as a term of self-identification that emphasized working-class origins as well as indigenous influences. The term is also used to describe the historical study of citizens of Mexican descent and a civil rights initiative that compelled federal authorities to acknowledge civil rights issues that relate to Chicanos. Cloture A parliamentary procedure in the U.S. Senate requiring the approval of a super-majority (three-fifths in the case of legislation; two-thirds in the case of a motion to amend Senate rule) of all Senators present to end debate on a pending proposal and bring the measure to final consideration and a vote. “Coattails” The influence or power of a political candidate to draw supporters to vote for other candidates on his or her party ticket on Election Day. In modern political lexicon, the term frequently is used to describe a presidential candidate’s ability to draw votes for congressional candidates further down the ballot. Cold War The state of ideological, economic, political, military, and cultural warfare pitting a capitalist United States
against a communist Soviet Union (USSR) from 1947 until
1991. Developing from divergent American and Soviet foreign
policies concerning the restoration of Europe after World War II,
the conflict spread from Europe to the rest of the world.
Although there were no direct military conflicts, the Soviet and
American superpowers tried to alter the international balance of
power in their favor by competing globally for allies, strategic
locations, natural resources, and influence in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. The Cold War ended with the collapse and
disintegration of the USSR in 1991. Colonialism The practice of a group of people who form a
community in a new country or territory while remaining subject
to their parent state. It also describes a policy of exploitation of a
less-powerful country or territory by a dominant nation. Committee (Standing, Joint, Select or Special) A
standing committee is permanently established by House and
Senate Rules and has the ability to receive and report bills
and resolutions to the full chamber. A Joint Committee is
also established by House and Senate Rules with membership
comprised of an equal number of Representatives and Senators
and a chairperson that traditionally rotates between a House and a Senate Member each Congress. A Select or Special Committee
is established by resolution for a defined period of time, is usually
created to investigate a specific legislative issue, and may or may
not have legislative authority. Committee of the Whole Also known as the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, a parliamentary procedure whereby the House dissolves into a smaller body for the purposes of expediting legislation and debate. The committee can then debate and amend legislation with a quorum of only 100 Members. House Rules permit Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to participate in debate and vote in the committee as long as their vote does not directly affect the legislation. The committee dissolves itself back into the full body of the House for final votes on legislation. Commonwealth (in Puerto Rico, Estado Libre Asociado) A nation, state, or political unit founded on law and united by compact or tacit agreement of the people for the common good. Used to refer to self-governing political units voluntarily associated with the United States, namely Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands and the Philippine Islands. The commonwealth agreement between the United States and Puerto Rico is the Estado Libre Asociado (Free Associated State or ELA), first enacted in 1952. Compromise of 1850 The Compromise of 1850 was a series of bills organizing land ceded by Mexico to the United States
in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. After President Zachary Taylor proposed carving two free states out of the land, Southern opponents threatened secession. Senator Henry Clay
of Kentucky responded with a package of compromises that was later made into a single omnibus bill. Clay’s resolutions proposed admission of California as a free state; establishment of the territories of Utah and New Mexico without restrictions on slavery; adjustment of the Texas-New Mexico boundary; assumption of the debt of the Republic of Texas; enactment of a stronger fugitive slave law; abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia; and approval of a resolution stating that Congress had no power over the interstate slave trade. Although his proposals failed to pass as one bill, each gained a majority on its own. By September 17, 1850, all of these proposals were signed into law by President Millard Fillmore. Constituents People living within the geographic area that a
Member of Congress represents. Cortes Spain’s parliament that consists of two houses: the lower house ( Congreso de los Diputados ), and the upper house ( El Senado ). Dean Unofficial title given to Representatives with the longest continuous service in the U.S. House of Representatives or from a particular state delegation. Decolonization A process that took place from 1945 to 1993 characterized by the dissolution of European colonial institutions in Africa and Asia and the emergence of postcolonial indigenous governments. Delegate A nonvoting official in the U.S. House currently
representing the following territories: the District of Columbia,
Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the
Northern Mariana Islands. Delegates serve two-year terms.
Delegates cannot vote in the full House but are permitted to vote
in committees and can introduce and cosponsor legislation. Under
a House Rule in place from 1993 to 1994 and again from 2007
to 2011, Delegates were temporarily permitted to vote in the
Committee of the Whole, during consideration of appropriations,
authorization, and tax bills for amendment. If the votes of the
Delegates were decisive on any vote in the Committee of the
Whole, the amendment was automatically voted on again in the
full House, where the Delegates could not vote. (See Resident Commissioner) Diaspora The migration of an ethnic group from their home
country or region to different parts of the world. Discharge Petition A rarely used legislative procedure in the House to force a bill to the floor when stalled in committee for more than 30 days. A motion with the signatures of 218 Members is necessary to dislodge a measure from committee, making it possible for the bill to reach the floor. Disfranchisement The act of depriving an eligible citizen or a portion of the population of voting rights. District A geographical area represented by a U.S. Representative. Empire Political dominion by a sovereign state over one or
more subject territories. Enemy Alien A foreign resident in a country with which his or
her country is at war. Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) A proposed constitutional amendment granting women equal protection under the law. Passed by Congress in 1972, the ERA then went to the states for ratification. Despite a 3-year extension to the constitutionally-mandated 7-year deadline, the ERA amendment failed to gain passage in the requisite three-fourths of the states and expired in 1982. Exclusion The act of barring or keeping out of a physical place
or society. Family Medical Leave Act Legislation requiring businesses with 50 or more employees to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a one-year period to deal with the medical issues of close family members. These issues include the birth, adoption, or placement into foster care of a child and the caring for a child, spouse, or parent in the case of a chronic health problem. The measure was signed into law on February 5, 1993. Congress amended the measure in January 2008 expanding the benefits to the family members of wounded war veterans. Filibuster A technique or strategy used in the Senate to postpone or prevent a vote on a bill. A Senator or group of Senators may implement a variety of tactics to delay a vote such as lengthy speeches and numerous amendments. Floor Manager A Representative or Senator who takes the lead in steering a bill or resolution through the debate and consideration process on the chamber floor. Often, such individuals are the majority chairman and ranking minority member of the committee that reports the bill to the floor. Freedmen’s Bureau From 1865 to 1872, the Bureau of Abandoned Lands, Freedmen, and Refugees (better known as the Freedmen’s Bureau) provided resources such as food, clothing, and medical treatment to freed slaves and southern white refugees. The Freedmen’s Bureau also interceded with employers to secure economic and civil rights for freed slaves and worked with northern philanthropists to open schools for them. “Freshman” Nickname given to Representatives and Senators serving in their first congressional term. Fusion A coalition of political parties or factions. Historically, the term refers to a movement in the South and West during the late 19th century, when the Populist Party “fused” with the Republican Party in an attempt to challenge Democratic Party rule. Gerrymander The act of dividing a geographic area into districts so as to give one party an unfair advantage during elections. In the early 19th century, the party of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry redrew the state’s congressional districts to favor its candidates. One district resembled a salamander; hence the combination of “Gerry” and “mander.” Grandfather Clause A constitutional provision that was frequently used in southern states, exempting descendants of men who voted prior to 1866 from suffrage restrictions such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and property requirements. This clause allowed poor, illiterate southern whites to vote while disfranchising blacks, whose enslaved ancestors had no voting rights. Great Depression The economic crisis and period of minimal business activity in the United States and other industrialized nations that began in 1929 and continued through the 1930s. During the 1920s in the United States, speculation on the stock market led to changes in federal monetary policy. The subsequent decline in personal consumption and investments triggered the stock market crash of 1929, which, along with World War I debts and reparations, precipitated the Great Depression. Great Migration A term used to describe two mass movements during the twentieth century. One movement occurred during the 1910s through 1950s as African Americans, in pursuit of economic, social, and political opportunities, moved from the rural, segregated South to the urban North and West. Another movement occurred during the 1950s as Puerto Ricans moved from Puerto Rico to the continental United States, especially New York City, for similar reasons. Great Society A wave of social reform legislation championed by President Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s and passed in the wake of a Democratic sweep in the 1964 presidential and congressional elections. The crowning legislation of Johnson’s reforms included increased aid for education, the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid providing healthcare for the elderly and the poor, immigration reform, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed literacy tests and provided federal monitoring of elections in southern states. Haole A Hawaiian term that means “foreigner” but is mainly
used to identify Caucasians. Hispano A 19th-century term describing a person of Hispanic and/or mestizo descent native to the American West and Southwest. House Rules The rules and precedents that govern the conduct of business in the House. These rules address duties of officers, the order of business, admission to the floor, parliamentary procedures on handling amendment and voting, and jurisdictions of committees. Whereas the House re-adopts its rules, usually with some changes, at the beginning of each Congress, Senate rules carry over from one Congress to the next. Ilustrados Wealthy, educated Filipinos who mostly lived
in the territory’s major cities during the era of Spanish rule
(1600–1896). Many ilustrados fought against the Spanish during
the 1896 revolution and against the United States during the
Philippine-American War (1899–1902). Others cooperated with
U.S. forces and helped develop a new territorial government.
After both wars, ilustrados sought professional careers in
business, education, and politics, including service as Resident
Commissioners to the U.S. Congress. Imperialism The policy of extending the authority of an empire
or nation over foreign countries or territories; acquiring and
maintaining political control over colonies and dependencies. Incumbency The holding of an office or the term of an office (usually political). Insular Territory A commonwealth, freely associated state,
possession, or territory that falls under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. government but is not a state or federal district. Internment An umbrella term used by the federal government
and generally accepted by the American public to describe
the systematic removal, relocation, and detainment of nearly
120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants primarily
from the West Coast during World War II. The majority of
internees were American citizens who—in addition to being
denied due process and other constitutional rights—lost their
possessions, homes, property, and businesses when they were
forcibly moved to relocation centers in remote locations in the
interior West. In recent decades, some leading scholars have
contested the use of the term, arguing that “incarceration” is a
more accurate description of the policy. Issei A Japanese term that identifies the generation of emigrants
who left Japan to settle in the United States. Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) A national
civic organization formed in San Francisco, California, in 1929 from
the merger of local West Coast nisei groups. The JACL lobbied
against legal discrimination and confronted misperceptions about
Japanese Americans’ loyalty to the United States. Jim Crow The term used to describe the segregation, social control, and political and economic subjugation of African Americans in the South (and Hispanic Americans in the Southwest) from the late 1800s to the 1960s. Joint Meeting A meeting of both the House and the Senate which occurs upon the adoption of a unanimous consent agreement to recess and meet with the other legislative body. Joint Meetings are typically reserved for addresses by visiting dignitaries and other U.S. government officials. Joint Session A meeting of both the House and the Senate which occurs upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution. Joint Sessions are typically reserved for the purpose of hearing a presidential address or to count electoral votes. Kibei A Japanese term that identifies nisei children who were
born in the United States, educated in Japan, and returned to the
United States. Lame Duck Session Refers to a session of Congress that transpires after congressional elections but before the start of a new Congress. In the 19th century, new Congresses commenced on March 4 (though both chambers often convened for business at later dates). Thus, after biennial fall elections, a new Congress was not seated for four months. Congress often convened for an additional, or lame duck, session in the intervening weeks in a hurried effort to complete legislative business. Ratification of the 20th Amendment in 1933 set the start date for new Congresses to January 3, drastically reducing the time period in which a lame duck session could transpire. As a result, modern Congresses have rarely held lame duck sessions. Lynching Execution without due process of law; the mob execution, usually by hanging and often accompanied by torture, of alleged criminals, especially African Americans, during the Jim Crow Era. Machine Politics A term used to refer to tight political organizations under the control of party regulars, often under the authority of a regional leader or “boss.” In the 19th and early 20th centuries, political parties used this system to disburse patronage rewards, turn out votes, and enforce party discipline. Manifest Destiny A term used in the 1840s to justify U.S. expansion into Texas, Oregon, and Mexico. Jacksonian
journalist John O’Sullivan is reputed to have coined the term and wrote that Manifest Destiny was “to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.” Mestizo A person of American Indian and Caucasian ancestry. Model Minority A journalistic description of Asian Americans
that stresses their economic success and compliance towards
general societal norms. The term has been used to denigrate
other ethnic and racial groups while penalizing more recent
Asian immigrants. Naturalization The action of admitting an alien to the
position and privileges of a native-born citizen or subject. Nikkei A Japanese term used to identify any person of
Japanese descent who emigrated abroad or is the descendant
of such individuals. Nisei A Japanese term that identifies the generation of Japanese
Americans who were born in the United States from their issei
immigrant parents. New Deal A period of political, economic, and social activity spanning President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first two terms in office (1933–1941). Working with Congress, the Roosevelt administration provided an unprecedented level of emergency legislative intervention in response to the Great Depression that was designed to revive the economy and to provide basic welfare to citizens. Nominating Convention A meeting of local party officials to select the delegates who eventually designated party nominees for elective office or represented the locality at state or national conventions. Developed in the 1820s and 1830s, the system ensured that only one member would run for an elective position while providing structure and publicity for the party. In the early 20th century the modern primary election replaced nominating conventions as the principal method for selecting congressional candidates. Nuevomexicano A 19th-century term used to describe
Hispanics and Caucasians living in New Mexico. Hispanic Americans in Congress uses the term to describe New Mexicans of Hispanic and/or mestizo descent. Oath of Office An affirmation taken by Members of Congress acknowledging the duty to uphold their office and to defend the Constitution. In the House, the oath is administered during the opening day of each Congress. Until the 1920s, the Speaker administered the oath to each separate House delegation. In modern practice, the dean of the House usually swears-in the Speaker, who then administers the oath to the Members en masse. Representatives elected thereafter by special election, are administered the oath by the presiding officer in the House Chamber. The oath is prescribed by the Constitution, but its language is set by law. Omnibus Bill A term used to refer to a package of numerous, often unrelated, bills that are bundled together and considered in Congress as a single measure. Patrón The master or owner of an estate; also used to describe a political boss. “Packing” and “Cracking” Techniques used to redraw electoral boundaries to favor one political party over another. “Packing” clustered voters within a geographic area to ensure a biased result. “Cracking” distributed voters across geographic areas to dilute their voting strength. Plantation An estate or farm, especially in a tropical or
subtropical country, on which crops such as coffee, tobacco, or
sugarcane were cultivated often by enslaved or contract laborers;
also used to denote a company of settlers or colonists. Plebiscite A vote by which the people of an entire country
or district express an opinion for or against a proposal especially on
a choice of government or ruler following the call for a referendum. Political Action Committee (PAC) In existence since the mid-1940s, PACs are non-party, political committees organized by a special interest to receive and spend money either to support or to defeat candidates seeking elective office. Federal PACs must register with the Federal Election Committee. Poll Tax A tax required as a qualification for voting used by some southern states to circumvent the 15th Amendment. Many poor African Americans could not afford to pay the tax and thus were unable to vote, but poor whites were exempt from the tax. Populism A political philosophy and movement that emerged in the agrarian West and South during the late 19th century. Populists advocated greater public participation in government and business to protect individuals from impersonal bureaucracies and financial conglomerates. Postbellum The period after a war, especially the American Civil War, 1861–1865. Primary A preliminary election usually between aspirants from the same political party held to determine who will serve as the
party’s candidate in the general election.

Progressive Era A social movement roughly beginning in the 1890s and ending shortly after U.S. entry in the First World War in 1917. Marked by a desire to reform society in the wake of the dramatic changes brought on by rapid American industrialization. Activists of the era—many of whom were women—pursued a broad range of democratic reforms within political, social, and cultural contexts. The attention paid to public service and political activism of the era contributed to the eventual success of the women’s suffrage movement. Prohibition Refers to the federal ban on alcohol implemented after passage of the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act. Prohibition laws made the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol—as well as its importation into the United States—illegal. The term also is used to describe the era when than alcohol ban was in effect, from its passage in January 1919 to its repeal in December 1933. Quorum The minimum number of Members needed to be present for the House or Senate to conduct business. The Constitution requires simple majorities of Members to achieve a quorum; in the modern chambers, given no vacancies, the numbers are 218 for the House and 51 in the Senate. In practice, however, both bodies act on the assumption that a quorum is present unless a Member suggests the absence of one or requests a quorum call. Additionally, according to a House rule, only 100 Members are required to achieve a quorum to conduct business in the Committee of the Whole. Ranking Member This term refers to the minority party member with the highest rank on a committee or a subcommittee. In some usages it can also apply to the majority party member next in rank to the chairman or chairwoman. Ranking minority members have a leadership role in that they often serve as floor managers to debate legislation on the floor and they also oversee the budget and administrative duties allotted to minority committee staff. From their initial assignment to a committee, Members generally work their way up from the bottom of the list as vacancies open above them. Realignment A new or unique merging of disparate political parties, philosophies, or organizations. Reconstruction Refers to both the 12-year period (1865–1877) and political process after the American Civil War in which the former Confederate states were re-admitted to the Union, beginning the nation’s long process of readjustment after the end of slavery.

and the apportionment of seats. State legislatures draw new
districts based on population declines or increases that result in the
subtraction or addition of House seats apportioned to the state. Redress Satisfaction or compensation for a wrong sustained or
the loss resulting from such a wrong. It was also the name given

their home country. Relocation Centers The official term for the 10 War
Relocation Center facilities where 120,000 Japanese Americans,
both immigrants and native-born citizens, were incarcerated
for much of World War II. During and since World War II,
these facilities have also been called “relocation centers,”
“detention centers,” “evacuation camps,” “internment camps,”
and “concentration camps.” Federal officials frequently referred
to them as “concentration camps” during the war at a time
when the label was associated with the Boer War and the
Cuban rebellions of the 1890s. Many of the post-war histories
and studies of this event have used “relocation,” “evacuation,”
and “internment.” More recent studies have begun to use
“incarceration” as a more accurate term. Renunciant A person who makes a formal resignation of some
right or trust, including citizenship. Reparations The act of making amends for a wrong done;
offering compensation. Resident Commissioner A non-voting Member of the House that is sent to represent the constituents of an unincorporated territory. Unlike Representatives and non-voting Delegates, Resident Commissioners currently serve for four-year terms. Puerto Rico has had a Resident Commissioner in the House since 1901.  While under U.S. rule, the Philippines also had 
Resident Commissioners who were elected by the Philippine
legislature from 1907 to 1936 and served in pairs. Philippine
presidents appointed subsequent Resident Commissioners from
1936 to 1946 per the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934. They
served in fixed terms that ranged from two to four years. Many
sought greater autonomy for the Philippines but were unable to
vote on final legislation or serve on committees per House Rules.
A total of 13 Resident Commissioners from the Philippines
served in the House from 1907 to 1946. Retention An action to hold or keep something or someone
fixed in a place or position. Rico Literally “the rich”; a term used to describe affluent Hispanos and Anglos in 19th-century New Mexico. Sansei A Japanese term that identifies the second generation of

Social Darwinism A 19th-century sociological theory, now
discredited, that argued that societies advance because of intense
competition and conflict between social groups. According to
the theory, social elites acquired their status as a result of their
biological superiority over weaker social groups. Special Election An election held by a state to fill a vacancy
created when a Member of Congress dies, resigns, or is expelled.
All House vacancies must be filled by election; Senate vacancies
usually are filled by temporary appointments until a special
election can be organized. Statutory Representation A position defined by congressional
mandate rather than by the U.S. Constitution. Territorial Delegates
and Resident Commissioners are statutory representatives. Senators
and Representatives are constitutional representatives. Suffrage The right to vote; the term also refers to the exercise of that right. Surrogate Representation The act of serving as a
representative of or spokesperson for a group of persons united
by gender or race and not confined to the boundaries of a
congressional district or state. This representational style was
prevalent among some minorities in Congress—particularly
after the 1960s—to advance a legislative agenda important to
minorities nationwide. To a degree, each minority group in
Congress has adopted some form of “surrogate representation.” Title IX The portion of the Educational Amendments of 1972 barring schools receiving federal funding from discrimination based on sex. The law precludes qualified institutions from denying participation in and equal benefits to women for any school-related program or activity. In 2002, Congress officially renamed the legislation the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act to honor one of the key authors of the initial bill. Title VII The portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting employers from discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and advancement based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Treaty A contract between two or more nation states relating to

U.S. Nationals receive some constitutional protections but are
exempt from all the rights reserved to citizens of U.S. States. Whip An assistant House or Senate Floor leader who helps
round up party Members for quorum calls and important votes.
Coined in the British Parliament, this term is derived from
“whipper-in,” a person who keeps the dogs from straying during
a fox hunt. Widow’s Mandate Describes the phenomenon of women succeeding their late husbands in Congress—a main entrée for women into political office until the 1960s. Particularly in the House, which requires special elections to fill vacancies, local party leaders often asked widows to serve as candidates. Expectations were that widows would serve as placeholders and retire to private life once a suitable long-term candidate (usually a man) was identified. Many congressional widows served abbreviated terms but others, particularly those who had prior experience serving as aides in their husbands’ offices or as his political surrogate in the district, enjoyed long and influential careers. Women’s Rights A reform movement which occurred in the U.S. from 1848 to 1920, which encompassed a wide range of issues concerning women’s equality. The movement began with the Seneca Falls Convention in New York in 1848, where activists unveiled the “Declaration of Sentiments, Grievances, and Resolutions”—a document modeled after the Declaration of Independence that outlined the goals of women’s rights reformers, including suffrage. Reformers also advocated increased economic freedom and educational opportunities for women. The passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920, granting women the right to vote, is widely regarded as the culmination of the first phase of the women’s rights movement. A second phase—prefaced on educational, economic, and sexual equality—occurred during the 1960s and 1970s. Year of the Woman Term used to describe the record number of new women who won election to the House of Representatives (24) and the Senate (4) in the 1992 election. In all, voters sent as many women to Congress in one year as were elected in any previous decade. The gains made by women during this election cycle received vast media attention and set into motion a decade of remarkable momentum and progress for women in politics. Below are frequently used congressional terms and those that appear in the Office of the Historian publications, Women in Congress , Black Americans in Congress , Hispanic Americans in Congress , and Asian and Pacific Islander Americans in Congress . For a list of terms about congressional records, see, Glossary of Terms Related to Congressional Records . /tiles/non-collection/e/ed_glossary_dictionary_2018_011_000-3.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object For nearly half a century, the House used this dictionary in the House Chamber.

those immigrants prohibited from attaining U.S. citizenship

Archipelago A chain or cluster of islands located in the same
body of water. Assembly Center Temporary detention centers established
by the Wartime Civil Control Administration in March 1942 to
facilitate the forced evacuation of 120,000 Japanese Americans
primarily from California, Washington, and Oregon. The
evacuation of citizens and residents to the assembly centers was
completed by mid-September 1942. Asylum A secure place of refuge, shelter, or retreat. At-Large Representative In modern practice, a Representative
elected in a state that has only one seat apportioned to it in the U.S.
House. For many years states that were apportioned more than one
Representative could elect an At-Large Representative in statewide
voting even when a majority of the state delegation was elected by
single-member, geographically defined districts. Until the mid-20th
century, At-Large Representatives were often elected immediately
following decennial apportionment. At-Large elections in states with
more than one seat in the U.S. House were abolished by federal law
in 1968. Barrio A neighborhood defined by geographical location, particular feature, or history. Bicameral A legislative body having two legislative chambers
or houses. Black Panthers (or Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) An organization formed in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to monitor police activity and brutality against residents in Oakland, California.

Caucus A meeting of party members in each chamber (House
Republicans and Senate Republicans refer to their gatherings as
a “conference”). A caucus is used primarily to select candidates

ago. The term also denotes a distinct Austronesian language. Chicano Used by Americans of Hispanic and/or mestizo descent in the 1960s and 1970s as a term of self-identification that emphasized working-class origins as well as indigenous influences. The term is also used to describe the historical study of citizens of Mexican descent and a civil rights initiative that compelled federal authorities to acknowledge civil rights issues that relate to Chicanos.

Cold War The state of ideological, economic, political, military, and cultural warfare pitting a capitalist United States
against a communist Soviet Union (USSR) from 1947 until
1991. Developing from divergent American and Soviet foreign
policies concerning the restoration of Europe after World War II,
the conflict spread from Europe to the rest of the world.
Although there were no direct military conflicts, the Soviet and
American superpowers tried to alter the international balance of
power in their favor by competing globally for allies, strategic
locations, natural resources, and influence in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. The Cold War ended with the collapse and
disintegration of the USSR in 1991. Colonialism The practice of a group of people who form a
community in a new country or territory while remaining subject

less-powerful country or territory by a dominant nation. Committee (Standing, Joint, Select or Special) A
standing committee is permanently established by House and
Senate Rules and has the ability to receive and report bills
and resolutions to the full chamber. A Joint Committee is
also established by House and Senate Rules with membership
comprised of an equal number of Representatives and Senators
and a chairperson that traditionally rotates between a House and a Senate Member each Congress. A Select or Special Committee
is established by resolution for a defined period of time, is usually
created to investigate a specific legislative issue, and may or may
not have legislative authority. Committee of the Whole Also known as the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, a parliamentary procedure whereby the House dissolves into a smaller body for the purposes of expediting legislation and debate. The committee can then debate and amend legislation with a quorum of only 100 Members. House Rules permit Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to participate in debate and vote in the committee as long as their vote does not directly affect the legislation. The committee dissolves itself back into the full body of the House for final votes on legislation. Commonwealth (in Puerto Rico, Estado Libre Asociado) A nation, state, or political unit founded on law and united by compact or tacit agreement of the people for the common good. Used to refer to self-governing political units voluntarily associated with the United States, namely Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands and the Philippine Islands. The commonwealth agreement between the United States and Puerto Rico is the Estado Libre Asociado (Free Associated State or ELA), first enacted in 1952. Compromise of 1850 The Compromise of 1850 was a series of bills organizing land ceded by Mexico to the United States
in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. After President Zachary Taylor proposed carving two free states out of the land, Southern opponents threatened secession. Senator Henry Clay
of Kentucky responded with a package of compromises that was later made into a single omnibus bill. Clay’s resolutions proposed admission of California as a free state; establishment of the territories of Utah and New Mexico without restrictions on slavery; adjustment of the Texas-New Mexico boundary; assumption of the debt of the Republic of Texas; enactment of a stronger fugitive slave law; abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia; and approval of a resolution stating that Congress had no power over the interstate slave trade. Although his proposals failed to pass as one bill, each gained a majority on its own. By September 17, 1850, all of these proposals were signed into law by President Millard Fillmore.

Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the
Northern Mariana Islands. Delegates serve two-year terms.
Delegates cannot vote in the full House but are permitted to vote
in committees and can introduce and cosponsor legislation. Under
a House Rule in place from 1993 to 1994 and again from 2007
to 2011, Delegates were temporarily permitted to vote in the
Committee of the Whole, during consideration of appropriations,
authorization, and tax bills for amendment. If the votes of the
Delegates were decisive on any vote in the Committee of the
Whole, the amendment was automatically voted on again in the
full House, where the Delegates could not vote. (See Resident Commissioner) Diaspora The migration of an ethnic group from their home
country or region to different parts of the world. Discharge Petition A rarely used legislative procedure in the House to force a bill to the floor when stalled in committee for more than 30 days. A motion with the signatures of 218 Members is necessary to dislodge a measure from committee, making it possible for the bill to reach the floor.

In the early 19th century, the party of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry redrew the state’s congressional districts to favor its candidates. One district resembled a salamander; hence the combination of “Gerry” and “mander.” Grandfather Clause A constitutional provision that was frequently used in southern states, exempting descendants of men who voted prior to 1866 from suffrage restrictions such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and property requirements. This clause allowed poor, illiterate southern whites to vote while disfranchising blacks, whose enslaved ancestors had no voting rights. Great Depression The economic crisis and period of minimal business activity in the United States and other industrialized nations that began in 1929 and continued through the 1930s. During the 1920s in the United States, speculation on the stock market led to changes in federal monetary policy. The subsequent decline in personal consumption and investments triggered the stock market crash of 1929, which, along with World War I debts and reparations, precipitated the Great Depression. Great Migration A term used to describe two mass movements during the twentieth century. One movement occurred during the 1910s through 1950s as African Americans, in pursuit of economic, social, and political opportunities, moved from the rural, segregated South to the urban North and West.

Ilustrados Wealthy, educated Filipinos who mostly lived
in the territory’s major cities during the era of Spanish rule
(1600–1896). Many ilustrados fought against the Spanish during
the 1896 revolution and against the United States during the
Philippine-American War (1899–1902). Others cooperated with
U.S. forces and helped develop a new territorial government.
After both wars, ilustrados sought professional careers in
business, education, and politics, including service as Resident
Commissioners to the U.S. Congress. Imperialism The policy of extending the authority of an empire

and generally accepted by the American public to describe
the systematic removal, relocation, and detainment of nearly
120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants primarily
from the West Coast during World War II. The majority of
internees were American citizens who—in addition to being
denied due process and other constitutional rights—lost their
possessions, homes, property, and businesses when they were
forcibly moved to relocation centers in remote locations in the
interior West. In recent decades, some leading scholars have
contested the use of the term, arguing that “incarceration” is a
more accurate description of the policy. Issei A Japanese term that identifies the generation of emigrants
who left Japan to settle in the United States. Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) A national
civic organization formed in San Francisco, California, in 1929 from
the merger of local West Coast nisei groups. The JACL lobbied

Joint Sessions are typically reserved for the purpose of hearing a presidential address or to count electoral votes. Kibei A Japanese term that identifies nisei children who were
born in the United States, educated in Japan, and returned to the
United States. Lame Duck Session Refers to a session of Congress that transpires after congressional elections but before the start of a new Congress. In the 19th century, new Congresses commenced on March 4 (though both chambers often convened for business at later dates). Thus, after biennial fall elections, a new Congress was not seated for four months. Congress often convened for an additional, or lame duck, session in the intervening weeks in a hurried effort to complete legislative business. Ratification of the 20th Amendment in 1933 set the start date for new Congresses to January 3, drastically reducing the time period in which a lame duck session could transpire. As a result, modern Congresses have rarely held lame duck sessions. Lynching Execution without due process of law; the mob execution, usually by hanging and often accompanied by torture, of alleged criminals, especially African Americans, during the Jim Crow Era. Machine Politics A term used to refer to tight political organizations under the control of party regulars, often under the authority of a regional leader or “boss.” In the 19th and early 20th centuries, political parties used this system to disburse patronage rewards, turn out votes, and enforce party discipline.

Working with Congress, the Roosevelt administration provided an unprecedented level of emergency legislative intervention in response to the Great Depression that was designed to revive the economy and to provide basic welfare to citizens. Nominating Convention A meeting of local party officials to select the delegates who eventually designated party nominees for elective office or represented the locality at state or national conventions. Developed in the 1820s and 1830s, the system ensured that only one member would run for an elective position while providing structure and publicity for the party. In the early 20th century the modern primary election replaced nominating conventions as the principal method for selecting congressional candidates.

Oath of Office An affirmation taken by Members of Congress acknowledging the duty to uphold their office and to defend the Constitution. In the House, the oath is administered during the opening day of each Congress. Until the 1920s, the Speaker administered the oath to each separate House delegation. In modern practice, the dean of the House usually swears-in the Speaker, who then administers the oath to the Members en masse. Representatives elected thereafter by special election, are administered the oath by the presiding officer in the House Chamber. The oath is prescribed by the Constitution, but its language is set by law. Omnibus Bill A term used to refer to a package of numerous, often unrelated, bills that are bundled together and considered in Congress as a single measure. Patrón The master or owner of an estate; also used to describe a political boss. “Packing” and “Cracking” Techniques used to redraw electoral boundaries to favor one political party over another. “Packing” clustered voters within a geographic area to ensure a biased result. “Cracking” distributed voters across geographic areas to dilute their voting strength.

subtropical country, on which crops such as coffee, tobacco, or
sugarcane were cultivated often by enslaved or contract laborers;
also used to denote a company of settlers or colonists. Plebiscite A vote by which the people of an entire country
or district express an opinion for or against a proposal especially on
a choice of government or ruler following the call for a referendum. Political Action Committee (PAC) In existence since the mid-1940s, PACs are non-party, political committees organized by a special interest to receive and spend money either to support or to defeat candidates seeking elective office. Federal PACs must register with the Federal Election Committee. Poll Tax A tax required as a qualification for voting used by some southern states to circumvent the 15th Amendment. Many poor African Americans could not afford to pay the tax and thus were unable to vote, but poor whites were exempt from the tax. Populism A political philosophy and movement that emerged in the agrarian West and South during the late 19th century. Populists advocated greater public participation in government and business to protect individuals from impersonal bureaucracies and financial conglomerates.

Pro Forma An official legislative day that fulfills the Constitutional mandate for Congress to assemble; however, no votes are cast and little floor business is conducted. Progressive Era A social movement roughly beginning in the 1890s and ending shortly after U.S. entry in the First World War in 1917. Marked by a desire to reform society in the wake of the dramatic changes brought on by rapid American industrialization. Activists of the era—many of whom were women—pursued a broad range of democratic reforms within political, social, and cultural contexts. The attention paid to public service and political activism of the era contributed to the eventual success of the women’s suffrage movement. Prohibition Refers to the federal ban on alcohol implemented after passage of the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act. Prohibition laws made the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol—as well as its importation into the United States—illegal. The term also is used to describe the era when than alcohol ban was in effect, from its passage in January 1919 to its repeal in December 1933. Quorum The minimum number of Members needed to be present for the House or Senate to conduct business. The Constitution requires simple majorities of Members to achieve a quorum; in the modern chambers, given no vacancies, the numbers are 218 for the House and 51 in the Senate. In practice, however, both bodies act on the assumption that a quorum is present unless a Member suggests the absence of one or requests a quorum call. Additionally, according to a House rule, only 100 Members are required to achieve a quorum to conduct business in the Committee of the Whole. Ranking Member This term refers to the minority party member with the highest rank on a committee or a subcommittee. In some usages it can also apply to the majority party member next in rank to the chairman or chairwoman. Ranking minority members have a leadership role in that they often serve as floor managers to debate legislation on the floor and they also oversee the budget and administrative duties allotted to minority committee staff. From their initial assignment to a committee, Members generally work their way up from the bottom of the list as vacancies open above them. Realignment A new or unique merging of disparate political parties, philosophies, or organizations. Reconstruction Refers to both the 12-year period (1865–1877) and political process after the American Civil War in which the former Confederate states were re-admitted to the Union, beginning the nation’s long process of readjustment after the end of slavery. Redemption A term used to denote either the political movement or the period in which white southerners worked to dismantle Reconstruction governments, disfranchise blacks, and reshape the South’s legal system to foster labor control and subordination of blacks to whites. Redistricting The redrawing of U.S. House districts within
states following the constitutionally mandated decennial census
and the apportionment of seats. State legislatures draw new
districts based on population declines or increases that result in the
subtraction or addition of House seats apportioned to the state. Redress Satisfaction or compensation for a wrong sustained or
the loss resulting from such a wrong. It was also the name given
to a grassroots movement organized by Japanese-American groups
to seek restitution for being interned by the federal government in
violation of their civil rights during World War II, which resulted
in loss of their possessions, homes, property, and businesses. Refugee A person who seeks refuge in a foreign country as a
result of warfare, religious persecution, or political persecution in
their home country. Relocation Centers The official term for the 10 War
Relocation Center facilities where 120,000 Japanese Americans,
both immigrants and native-born citizens, were incarcerated
for much of World War II. During and since World War II,
these facilities have also been called “relocation centers,”
“detention centers,” “evacuation camps,” “internment camps,”
and “concentration camps.” Federal officials frequently referred
to them as “concentration camps” during the war at a time
when the label was associated with the Boer War and the
Cuban rebellions of the 1890s. Many of the post-war histories
and studies of this event have used “relocation,” “evacuation,”
and “internment.” More recent studies have begun to use
“incarceration” as a more accurate term. Renunciant A person who makes a formal resignation of some
right or trust, including citizenship. Reparations The act of making amends for a wrong done;
offering compensation. Resident Commissioner A non-voting Member of the House that is sent to represent the constituents of an unincorporated territory. Unlike Representatives and non-voting Delegates, Resident Commissioners currently serve for four-year terms. Puerto Rico has had a Resident Commissioner in the House since 1901.  While under U.S. rule, the Philippines also had 
Resident Commissioners who were elected by the Philippine
legislature from 1907 to 1936 and served in pairs. Philippine
presidents appointed subsequent Resident Commissioners from
1936 to 1946 per the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934. They
served in fixed terms that ranged from two to four years. Many
sought greater autonomy for the Philippines but were unable to
vote on final legislation or serve on committees per House Rules.
A total of 13 Resident Commissioners from the Philippines
served in the House from 1907 to 1946. Retention An action to hold or keep something or someone
fixed in a place or position. Rico Literally “the rich”; a term used to describe affluent Hispanos and Anglos in 19th-century New Mexico. Sansei A Japanese term that identifies the second generation of
Japanese Americans who were born in the United States. Scalawag A derogatory name denoting an imposter or intriguer, especially in politics. In the 19th century, the popular press applied the name to white southerners who willingly worked within the system of the Union-backed state Reconstruction governments. Seniority Priority or precedence in office or service; superiority in standing to another of equal rank by reason of earlier entrance into the service or an earlier date of appointment. Sine Die From the Latin, meaning “without setting a day.” A sine die adjournment signifies that Congress has adjourned (suspended its business) at the end of an annual or special session. Social Darwinism A 19th-century sociological theory, now
discredited, that argued that societies advance because of intense
competition and conflict between social groups. According to
the theory, social elites acquired their status as a result of their
biological superiority over weaker social groups. Special Election An election held by a state to fill a vacancy
created when a Member of Congress dies, resigns, or is expelled.
All House vacancies must be filled by election; Senate vacancies
usually are filled by temporary appointments until a special
election can be organized. Statutory Representation A position defined by congressional
mandate rather than by the U.S. Constitution. Territorial Delegates
and Resident Commissioners are statutory representatives. Senators
and Representatives are constitutional representatives. Suffrage The right to vote; the term also refers to the exercise of that right. Surrogate Representation The act of serving as a
representative of or spokesperson for a group of persons united
by gender or race and not confined to the boundaries of a
congressional district or state. This representational style was
prevalent among some minorities in Congress—particularly
after the 1960s—to advance a legislative agenda important to
minorities nationwide. To a degree, each minority group in
Congress has adopted some form of “surrogate representation.” Title IX The portion of the Educational Amendments of 1972 barring schools receiving federal funding from discrimination based on sex. The law precludes qualified institutions from denying participation in and equal benefits to women for any school-related program or activity. In 2002, Congress officially renamed the legislation the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act to honor one of the key authors of the initial bill. Title VII The portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting employers from discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and advancement based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Treaty A contract between two or more nation states relating to
peace, commerce, or other international relations. Unincorporated Territory An insular area that the United
States controls but that has not been fully incorporated into the
Union and where Congress has determined that only select parts
of the U.S. Constitution apply. Citizens of an unincorporated
territory receive some constitutional protections but not all the
rights enjoyed by the citizens of U.S. states. U.S. National A person who lives in an unincorporated
territory. Their citizenship is defined by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or from specific statutes.
U.S. Nationals receive some constitutional protections but are
exempt from all the rights reserved to citizens of U.S. States. Whip An assistant House or Senate Floor leader who helps
round up party Members for quorum calls and important votes.
Coined in the British Parliament, this term is derived from
“whipper-in,” a person who keeps the dogs from straying during
a fox hunt. Widow’s Mandate Describes the phenomenon of women succeeding their late husbands in Congress—a main entrée for women into political office until the 1960s. Particularly in the House, which requires special elections to fill vacancies, local party leaders often asked widows to serve as candidates. Expectations were that widows would serve as placeholders and retire to private life once a suitable long-term candidate (usually a man) was identified. Many congressional widows served abbreviated terms but others, particularly those who had prior experience serving as aides in their husbands’ offices or as his political surrogate in the district, enjoyed long and influential careers. Women’s Rights A reform movement which occurred in the U.S. from 1848 to 1920, which encompassed a wide range of issues concerning women’s equality. The movement began with the Seneca Falls Convention in New York in 1848, where activists unveiled the “Declaration of Sentiments, Grievances, and Resolutions”—a document modeled after the Declaration of Independence that outlined the goals of women’s rights reformers, including suffrage. Reformers also advocated increased economic freedom and educational opportunities for women. The passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920, granting women the right to vote, is widely regarded as the culmination of the first phase of the women’s rights movement. A second phase—prefaced on educational, economic, and sexual equality—occurred during the 1960s and 1970s. Year of the Woman Term used to describe the record number of new women who won election to the House of Representatives (24) and the Senate (4) in the 1992 election. In all, voters sent as many women to Congress in one year as were elected in any previous decade. The gains made by women during this election cycle received vast media attention and set into motion a decade of remarkable momentum and progress for women in politics. /tiles/non-collection/e/ed_glossary_dictionary_2018_011_000-3.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object For nearly half a century, the House used this dictionary in the House Chamber.

Congress Overview The 35th Congress (1857–1859) opened under Democratic leadership in both the House and Senate, but for the first time Republicans stood as the dominant opposition party. In Kansas, antislavery voters boycotted (and the territorial legislature rejected) the proslavery constitutional referendum—the effect of which reverberated all the way to Washington. The debate in the House over the Kansas controversy led to a huge brawl on the floor that ended only after one Member’s hairpiece was ripped off. Congress passed legislation for another constitutional referendum that, if approved, guaranteed Kansas federal aid or, if rejected, postponed statehood.

Congress Overview The 1898 elections undercut the Republican majority in the House but bolstered it in the Senate. The 56th Congress (1899–1901) dealt primarily with the consequences of the Spanish-American War. Congress formed civil governments in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. It created the Office of the Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico. Congress also provided a civil government and nonvoting Delegate for Hawaii, where it extended U.S. citizenship to the islands’ inhabitants as well.

These lists contain Saturday and Sunday legislative days only. By definition, a legislative day begins after an adjournment and ends with an adjournment. A House legislative day’s opening and closing normally, but not always, coincide with a calendar day. The charts do not include legislative days that commenced on a Friday and carried over into a Saturday or Sunday calendar day. In addition, Saturday and Sunday legislative days that occurred in special sessions—like that of President Harry S. Truman’s recall of House and Senate Members in the 80th Congress—also are not included in the charts. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the House convened legislative days on weekends far more often than the modern House. Changes in the nation’s size, transportation system, and the needs of Representatives and Delegates, account for this phenomenon. Traveling great distances by primitive modes of transportation, early Members of Congress compressed their brief legislative sessions in the nation’s capital, often meeting for six legislative days each week. In more recent times, aided by rapid transit, Members gather at the Capitol more frequently but tend to convene only three or four legislative days per week in order to spend the balance of their time in their districts. Despite the infrequency of modern working weekends, it is important to note the 1st Congress (1789–1791) lasted for 210 days over the course of two calendar years, while the 108th Congress (2003–2005) lasted for 659 days of the same two-year span. Only three times has the Opening Day of a Congress fallen on a weekend. On March 4, 1871, and on January 3, 1953, the Opening Days for the 42nd (1871–1873) and 83rd (1953–1955) Congresses, respectively, fell on a Saturday. On January 3, 2021, the 117th Congress (2021–2023) met for Opening Day on a Sunday.

Rainey of South Carolina was sworn-in as the first African-American Member elected to the United States House of Representatives. To commemorate the 150th anniversary of this landmark in congressional history, the Office of the Historian has conducted oral histories with African-American Members, staff, and family. The interviews in this ongoing project provide firsthand accounts of the African-American experience on Capitol Hill since the 1950s—a period of dramatic change when Black Members were able to build seniority, shape legislation, and secure leadership positions. Learn more about this project . Roger Addison A native Washingtonian, Roger Addison witnessed many changes in the District of Columbia and at the Capitol during his more than three decades of service in the House of Representatives. From moving furniture, to working in the main office for the Clerk of the House, and overseeing financial disclosures, Addison’s career involved a variety of unique, behind-the-scenes responsibilities. The Honorable Yvonne Brathwaite Burke Yvonne Brathwaite Burke made headlines during her political career, most notably for being the first Member to give birth while serving in Congress. With a seat on the Appropriations Committee and as the first woman to chair the Congressional Black Caucus, Burke built her reputation as a political star during her three terms in the House. The Honorable G.K. Butterfield Jr. G.K. Butterfield Jr. was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004 after a long career as a civil rights lawyer and state judge. For nearly two decades, Butterfield represented eastern North Carolina on Capitol Hill, holding a seat on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, serving a term as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and playing a key role in the Democratic Whip operation. The Honorable William Lacy Clay Sr. A civil rights activist and labor leader, William Lacy Clay, Sr. built a strong following as a local politician in St. Louis before coming to Congress. During his more than three decades in the U.S. House, Clay, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, was a leading spokesperson for African Americans in his district and across the country. The Honorable Eva M. Clayton As the first African-American woman elected to Congress from North Carolina, Eva M. Clayton used her position on the Agriculture Committee to represent the small farmers of her rural district. Greatly influenced by the civil rights movement, Clayton’s political career reflected her interest in advocating for women and African Americans in her district and beyond. The Honorable Ronald V. Dellums Ronald V. Dellums came to Congress as an outspoken Vietnam War critic and civil rights activist. He made history as the first African-American Member to serve on and chair the Armed Services Committee and built a legacy as a tireless leader in the movement to end apartheid in South Africa. The Honorable Donna F. Edwards Building on momentum from a grassroots campaign against an incumbent Representative, Donna Edwards made history on her second run for office, becoming the first African-American woman elected to Congress from Maryland. During her decade in the House, the Maryland Congresswoman sought to protect women from domestic violence and worked to promote health care reform. Arva Marie Johnson With her historic appointment as the first African-American woman officer on the Capitol Police Force, Arva Marie Johnson observed many changes in the institution’s security during her 32-year career, and was an officer during the 1998 shooting at the Capitol and on September 11, 2001. The Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson During her three decades in Congress, Eddie Bernice Johnson used her nursing background, experience in the Texas state legislature, and seniority to develop bipartisan relationships to advance her legislative agenda. Johnson was an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which she chaired in the 107th Congress (2001–2003). In addition to serving as dean of the Texas delegation late in her career, she made history by becoming the first woman and Black Member to chair the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. James Johnson In 1959, James Johnson accepted an invitation to become a House Page. But when he arrived in DC, House officials retracted his appointment, telling him all the positions were filled. That episode focused national attention on the 15-year-old high school student. Five Representatives eventually agreed to hire him as a messenger for their offices, allowing him to become one of the first African Americans to attend the Capitol Page School. The Honorable John R. Lewis In 1965 John R. Lewis and other peaceful protestors were brutally attacked by state troopers during a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. This event, which became known as “Bloody Sunday,” played a pivotal role in the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. For over two decades, Representative Lewis led a congressional pilgrimage to Selma—and other cities across the state—to reflect on the civil rights movement. The Honorable Kendrick B. Meek The son of former Member Carrie P. Meek of Florida, Kendrick B. Meek became the first African American to succeed his mother in Congress. Carrie Meek, elected as one of the first Black Members to represent Florida since Reconstruction, served on the influential Appropriations Committee during her decade-long career in the U.S. House and became a political mentor to her son. Frank Mitchell As the first African-American House Page of the 20th century, Frank Mitchell made history by breaking racial barriers while also witnessing significant moments in the civil rights movement, including the floor debates for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Muriel Morisey During the 1970s, Muriel Morisey was a constituent case worker, press secretary, and senior legislative assistant for New York Representative Shirley Chisholm and District of Columbia Delegate Walter Fauntroy. Her skills as a speechwriter, education policy expert, and advocate for constituents on Capitol Hill served as valuable preparation for the next phase of her career as a civil rights lawyer and academic. Carlottia Scott Carlottia Scott worked in the House for more than 20 years. Before becoming the chief of staff for California Representatives Ronald V. Dellums and Barbara Lee, she worked for the Committee on the District of Columbia, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Congresswoman Cardiss Collins of Illinois. Throughout her career, she advocated for diverse perspectives in the legislative process. The Honorable Albert Russell Wynn After a decade in the Maryland state legislature, Albert Russell Wynn won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992. As a Member of Congress, he joined the Congressional Black Caucus, served on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and addressed the needs of his congressional district, which had the largest concentration of federal workers in the country.

Caucus records show Representatives Niblack and Randall as both having served as Democratic Caucus Chairman during the Congress, but no dates of service were specified. 2 Heitshusen, "Party Leaders in the United States Congress, 1789–2015." Former Parliamentarian Clarence Cannon's notes state, "Cox died during this Congress and [Representative James B.] McCreary evidently succeeded or acted for him." However, Representative Cox died on September 10, 1889, six months after the sine die adjournment of the 50th Congress and the convening of the 51st Congress. 3 Heitshusen, "Party Leaders in the United States Congress, 1789–2015." Caucus records are contradictory for this period. They show the election of Representative James Hay as Democratic Caucus Chairman on January 19, 1911, but do not mention a resignation by incumbent chairman Clayton, nor do they specify that Hay was elected chairman for the new Congress. Later, they show the election of Representative Burleson on April 11, 1911. 4 Heitshusen, "Party Leaders in the United States Congress, 1789–2015." Caucus records are contradictory for this period.

Congress Overview The Korean War shaped much of the activity of the 82nd Congress (1951–1953). American-led forces successfully rolled back North Korean troops to near the Chinese border in late 1950, prompting China’s devastating counterattack. When General Douglas MacArthur undermined President Harry Truman’s negotiations to end the conflict by publicly contradicting U.S. policy, Truman fired him. The general nevertheless returned to a hero’s welcome—even addressing a Joint Session of Congress—before a series of House and Senate hearings on Korean policy discredited him. Congress passed a GI bill for Korean War veterans and the restrictive McCarran–Walter immigration act.

In the House, Trumbull served as Speaker of the House in the Second Congress. Congress Overview Emergent political factions made the 2nd Congress (1791–1793) contentious. One group favored President George Washington and his decision to strengthen federal authority, while another sniped at his Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton , for having centralized the nation’s banking power. Factionalism got so bad that some Members attempted unsuccessfully to investigate Treasury Department operations. This Congress established the post office system, required all able-bodied males to join a state militia, and enacted a Fugitive Slave Act. The House, in its first congressional investigation, examined a military disaster on the western frontier after American Indians routed U.S. troops.

Election Statistics, 2018 Vacancies and Successors /tiles/non-collection/C/Chamber_PA2015_06_0082.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives The House Chamber was remodeled in 1950 and updated with electronic voting in 1972. Congress Overview After picking up 41 seats in the 2018 midterm elections, the Democratic Party held the House majority for the 116th Congress for the first time in eight years. The Membership of the House on Opening Day was the most diverse in American history up to that point, and included record numbers of women, Black American, Hispanic American, Asian Pacific American, and American Indian lawmakers. Amid a divided government—Republicans controlled the Senate and the presidency—the 116th Congress (2019–2021) re-opened federal agencies following a partial shutdown from the previous Congress and went on to pass 344 measures into law, including the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, which expanded protections for America’s public lands and opened access to the outdoors. On December 18, 2019, the House impeached President Donald J. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate later acquitted Trump. Beginning in March 2020, Congress confronted the global coronavirus pandemic, enacting far-reaching public health policies as well as the CARES Act, a $2 trillion stimulus meant to bolster the economy. Because of the pandemic’s social-distancing requirements, the House’s operating processes changed markedly. Many congressional offices switched to remote work, committees held virtual hearings, and the House allowed lawmakers to vote remotely by proxy.

Congress Overview Republicans swept into the White House and took over the Senate after the 1980 elections. Democrats maintained a diminished House majority. President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt and Congress quickly passed a series of tax and domestic spending cuts, deregulated certain industries, and added defense spending during the first session of the 97th Congress (1981–1983). But the resulting budget deficit led Congress to increase taxes and reduce the gap between spending and revenues during its second session.

Congress Overview The 43rd Congress confronted a weak U.S. economy and widespread government corruption. When the railroad bubble burst in 1873, western farmers lashed out against wealthy financiers and their attempt to corner the gold market. As the public grew increasingly disillusioned following a series of government scandals, Congress repealed parts of the generous pay raise from the 42nd Congress (1871–1873) and investigated executive-branch corruption. As a result, the Treasury Secretary and the Postmaster General resigned.

While President Thomas Jefferson raised a series of constitutional objections to the purchase, Congress brushed them aside and appropriated $15 million towards acquiring the massive land tract.

To commemorate the centennial of her November 1916 election and April 1917 swearing-in as a U.S. Representative, the Office of the House Historian conducted oral histories with former women Members, staff, and family. Drawn from decades of congressional experience, the interviews in this ongoing project convey a larger narrative about the transformative role of women in American politics and their contributions to Congress during the past century. Learn more about this project . Representatives After her historic election in 1916, Jeannette Rankin predicted that more women would follow her to Congress. In this collection of interviews, women Members from across the country give credence to Rankin’s bold words, recalling the many ways they made a lasting impact on the institution. Staff Staff Tucked behind the scenes, House staff perform a myriad of functions to keep Congress running smoothly. Over the years, women have made great strides working for Members, committees, leadership, and House Officers, gaining equal access to staff positions historically held by men. Family From campaigning, to office work, to attending district events, family members have contributed to the careers of many Representatives. Interviews with family provide a unique and personal perspective of the experience of women Members of Congress.

Congress Overview Republicans regained control of both the House and Senate after the 1918 elections. President Woodrow Wilson’s dream for a League of Nations died when the Treaty of Versailles, ending World War I, failed in the 66th Congress. Congress privatized the nation’s railroads and merchant marine fleet.

Once the states approved the 18th Amendment, Congress implemented Prohibition with passage of the Volstead Act. Congress also sent the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women’s suffrage, to the states for ratification. Republicans regained control of both the House and Senate after the 1918 elections.

Anderson From House Page to Clerk of the House, Donn Anderson’s 35-year career included a series of administrative and managerial positions which brought him in close contact with Members of Congress, momentous debates, and important changes to the daily customs of the House. George W. Andrews III House Page and the son of former Representatives George and Elizabeth Andrews of Alabama, George W. Andrews III had a unique perspective of the historic events that took place at the Capitol and the institutional changes which occurred in Congress during the 1950s and 1960s. Albert R. Anness Between Capitol Page School, assignments in the House Document Room, and operating the sound system for committee hearings, Albert Anness stayed busy as a House Page in the 81st Congress (1949-1951). Joe Bartlett House Page, reading clerk, and Clerk to the Minority, Joe Bartlett participated in many significant events during his 30-plus years on the Hill, including graduating from the Capitol Page School and working in the House Ways and Means Committee Room during the House Chamber renovation.  The Honorable Clarence J. "Bud" Brown Jr. Clarence J. "Bud" Brown Jr. grew up as the son of a leading Ohio politician, worked as an editor and executive in his family newspaper business, and eventually succeeded his late father in the U.S. House in 1965. He served more than 17 years on Capitol Hill before leaving to run for Governor of Ohio. He later served in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, and then led a nonprofit that promoted congressional and Capitol history. The Honorable Ronald V. Dellums Ronald V. Dellums came to Congress as an outspoken Vietnam War critic and civil rights activist. He made history as the first African-American Member to serve on and chair the Armed Services Committee and built a legacy as a tireless leader in the movement to end apartheid in South Africa. The Honorable John Dingell, Jr. From Page to Dean of the House, John Dingell, Jr.’s congressional service spanned from World War II into the 21st century. The son of Michigan Representative John Dingell, Sr., Dingell, Jr.’s long history in the House began as a Page where he learned the institutional ropes by observing his father, and House leaders like Sam Rayburn and John McCormack.

Arva Marie Johnson With her historic appointment as the first African-American woman officer on the Capitol Police Force, Arva Marie Johnson observed many changes in the institution’s security during her 32-year career, and was an officer during the 1998 shooting at the Capitol and on September 11, 2001. Charles W. Johnson Charles W. Johnson spent four decades on Capitol Hill working in the Office of the Parliamentarian. He served as Parliamentarian of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994 to 2004.

The Honorable John R. Lewis In 1965 John R. Lewis and other peaceful protestors were brutally attacked by state troopers during a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. This event, which became known as “Bloody Sunday,” played a pivotal role in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. For over two decades, Representative Lewis led a congressional pilgrimage to Selma—and other cities across the state—to reflect on the civil rights movement. Felda Looper After a successful letter-writing campaign to Speaker Carl Albert, Felda Looper’s appointment as a Page in the summer of 1973, in the midst of the Equal Rights Amendment debate and the Watergate investigation, made history when she became the first woman to join the House Page ranks. Charles Marston During his 35 years on Capitol Hill, most of which he spent in the House Press Gallery, Charles Marston assisted reporters in their coverage of Congress from routine committee hearings to historic events like the 1954 shooting in the House Chamber. Frank Mitchell As the first African-American House Page of the 20th century, Frank Mitchell made history by breaking racial barriers while also witnessing significant moments in the civil rights movement, including the floor debates for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Glenn Rupp An eyewitness to the World War I Veterans’ Bonus March, Glenn Rupp’s House Page service included training future President Lyndon B. Johnson as a doorkeeper, as well as attending President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first inauguration and State of the Union Address. Joe Strickland Joe Strickland worked as an official reporter in the House of Representatives for more than 20 years, becoming chief reporter in 2005. He developed a firm grasp on the specialized legislative system by working both on the House Floor and in committee hearings and felt like “a fly on the wall” as an eyewitness to congressional history. Irving Swanson On the rostrum during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Day of Infamy” speech on December 8, 1941, Irving Swanson, a House reading clerk, read the historic roll calls when the House approved war declarations against Japan, and, several days later, against Germany and Italy.

Congress Overview The 91st Congress (1969–1971) faced several daunting challenges: an unpopular war in Vietnam, race riots in the cities, a rising crime rate, and an economic recession. College campuses erupted in protest when President Richard M. Nixon ordered U.S. troops into Cambodia and escalated the Vietnam War. Congress defeated the President’s attempt to change welfare policy and rejected two of Nixon’s nominees to the Supreme Court. As animosity mounted between the White House and Capitol Hill, Congress reorganized itself in 1970 to foster transparency with new voting rules, a new budget process, and more professional staff.

Wilcox of Hawaii became the first Asian Pacific American (APA) to serve in Congress, a total of 75 APAs have served as U.S. Representatives, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, or Senators. This website, based on the publication Asian and Pacific Islander Americans in Congress , contains biographical profiles of former APAs, links to information about current APA Members, essays on the institutional and national events that shaped successive generations of APAs in Congress, and images of each individual Member, including rare photos. Member Profiles Read biographical profiles of former Asian Pacific American Representatives, Delegates, and Senators that focus on their congressional careers. These profiles also contain suggestions for further reading and references to Members’ manuscript collections. Introduction Since 1900, Asian Pacific Americans have represented unique and diverse constituencies in Congress. From the Philippines to California, from Virginia to Hawaii, APA Members and Senators have shaped landmark pieces of legislation in the 20th and 21st centuries. Fighting for justice and equality, their ranks have grown in both number and power. Many of their stories are being told here for the first time. Exclusion and Empire, 1898–1941 The annexation of both Hawaii and the Philippines in 1898 opened a new chapter in congressional history. Limited in their legislative tools as statutory representatives and stymied by racial prejudice, Resident Commissioners and Delegates worked to protect their islands’ economies and define their political status. Elsewhere across America, discriminatory policies at the federal and state level denied Asian immigrants access to citizenship and all but erased their political rights. From Exclusion to Inclusion, 1941–1992 During World War II, the federal government imprisoned 120,000 Japanese Americans in remote, heavily guarded camps using a reactionary wartime policy called internment. Stripped of their civil liberties, some children who grew up in the camps would go on to win election to Congress many years later. After the war, new federal immigration law opened citizenship to millions, and in 1956 Dalip Saund of California became the first APA elected to Congress with full voting rights. A Growing Diversity, 1993–2017 Starting in the early 1990s, the number of Asian Pacific Americans in Congress grew exponentially. The Members in this section account for roughly half of all APAs ever elected, and embody a diverse collection of personal and family histories. Representing constituencies from every corner of America, this group of legislators founded their Caucus in 1994 to support issues and legislation important to Asian Pacific American communities everywhere.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 focused on access to public accommodations and equal employment. Despite its far-reaching provisions, the bill did not fully address barriers to voting in America, leading to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The narratives in this exhibit tell the stories of these important pieces of legislation. Delivering on a Dream: The House and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 On July 2, 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, enacting a long-sought-after piece of legislation to fulfill the promise of equality enshrined in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. Rooted in bipartisanship and perseverance, the Civil Rights Act brought together unlikely allies to pass this landmark bill. Historical Documents: 1964 Civil Rights Act The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a watershed moment for the protection of civil liberties in America. Explore key documents and individuals associated with this significant piece of legislation. The House and Selma: Bridging History and Memory On March 7, 1965, state troopers attacked civil rights demonstrators attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The violence of “Bloody Sunday” changed the course of the civil rights movement and led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Congress Overview Republicans kept control of the 39th Congress (1865–1867), and Abraham Lincoln went back to the White House following the 1864 elections. Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, however, elevated Andrew Johnson to the presidency. Johnson took control of the South’s reconstruction, freely issued pardons to former Confederates, and backed the new segregated state governments. Congress quickly circumvented Johnson's authority and passed the First Reconstruction Act, which put the South under military rule. It also designed an Army hierarchy independent of the President and passed the Tenure of Office Act, which required the Senate to approve the removal of executive officials.

Here, Speakers Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois, Champ Clark of Missouri, Nicholas Longworth of Ohio, and Sam Rayburn of Texas presided. The Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives was the first federal office created in the Constitution and has been at the forefront of America’s nation-building for more than two centuries. As the head of America’s popularly elected branch of government, the Office of the Speaker has shaped and has been shaped by the democratic forces coursing through the country. It is impossible to separate the Speakership from the people it serves and the history they share. The Constitution says only that “the House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker.” The Framers made the Speakership independent of any other governmental authority and left it to the American people and their Representatives to determine the powers and prerogatives of the office. The American Speakership was, and remains, an office in a constant state of evolution. Because the House reconstitutes itself every two years at the start of each new Congress, lawmakers have regularly molded the office to fit their needs and those of the voters to whom they are accountable. Each Speaker could only wield the power the House—by a majority vote—allowed them to have. As a result, no two Speakerships have been the same. This booklet (PDF) is about the individuals who served as Speaker and the contours and rhythms of their office. It is a story about the constellation of political movements, lawmakers, aides, and everyday people who have shaped the Speakership in myriad ways. In large measure, the history of the Speakership is also a history of the U.S. House of Representatives. But it is ultimately a history of America and its experiment in democratic self-government. /tiles/non-collection/A/AmplifiersInstalled_PA2015_03_0044.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object This 1922 image of the House Chamber shows the original marble rostrum used from 1857 to 1949.

                    and Senate Receptions. A Joint Meeting is the preferred method for receiving addresses from foreign leaders
                    and dignitaries. Joint Meetings are used for special commemorative events and to
                    receive addresses by domestic dignitaries. To initiate a Joint Meeting, both houses,
                    by resolution or by unanimous consent, declare themselves in recess for a joint
                    gathering in the House Chamber. House Rule IV governs this procedure: “The Hall of the House shall be used only for the legislative business of the House
                    and for caucus and conference meetings of its Members, except when the House agrees
                    to take part in any ceremonies to be observed therein. The Speaker may not entertain
                    a motion for the suspension of this clause.” As precedent has evolved, however, the House has tended to use unanimous consent,
                    rather than a resolution, for the purpose of receiving a foreign leader. A Joint Session of Congress has been used almost exclusively to receive the President’s
                    State of the Union Address (prior to 1942 called the Annual Message), other presidential
                    addresses, and the counting of electoral votes for the President and Vice President
                    of the U.S. Both chambers follow a formal procedure to establish these occasions
                    by adopting a concurrent resolution. Only twice have foreign dignitaries addressed
                    a Joint Session of Congress: French Ambassador Andre de Laboulaye (20 May 1934),
                    to mark the centennial of the death of the Marquis de Lafayette, and Cuban Ambassador
                    Guillermo Belt (19 April 1948), to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cuban independence
                    after the Spanish-American War in 1898.

Congress Overview The 1840 elections put the Whigs in control of Congress and the presidency for the first time. President William Henry Harrison died a month later, however, and John Tyler —the first vice president to assume the executive’s office in U.S. history—wasted little time before vetoing the Whig’s signature piece of legislation creating the Third Bank of the United States. The 27th Congress (1841–1843) also passed the Apportionment Act of 1842 which specified that a House district could only be represented by a single Representative.

Congress Overview Republicans won congressional majorities for the first time in 15 years after the 1946 elections. The 80th Congress quickly sent to the states for ratification a constitutional amendment limiting Presidents to two terms, and it reined in trade unions with the Taft-Hartley Labor-Management Relations Act. But foreign policy dominated this Congress, as it reaffirmed America’s new global position. It authorized economic and military aid to countries threatened by the Soviet Union, passed the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, unified the armed services, and created the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency.

It was crafted by William Adams, a New York silversmith. The original mace had been destroyed when the British burned the Capitol in 1814, and during the intervening years, a wooden mace was used. The mace is made of 13 thin ebony rods representing the original states. The rods are bound together by the twining silver bands, which are pinned together and held at the top and bottom of the shaft by repoussé silver bands. The inscription “Wm. Adams/Manufacturer/New York/1841” is engraved on the bottom band. A silver globe with an eagle perched on it sits at the top of the mace, with the Western Hemisphere facing front.

Congress Overview The Cold War dominated the 85th Congress (1957–1959). Congress authorized military and economic aid to Middle Eastern countries fighting communist expansion and took a first step toward cracking racial segregation. The Soviet Union’s 1957 success in launching the first man-made satellite into Earth’s orbit inaugurated the “space race” between the superpowers. Congress established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); created congressional science panels; and passed the National Defense Education Act which funded enhanced science, mathematics, and foreign languages programs. In 1958, Congress passed a statehood act for Alaska which joined the Union in early 1959.

The Framers who devised the Constitution required that all revenue policies begin in the House of Representatives, the chamber which has always been directly elected by the American people. Since the earliest Congresses, the House Committee on Ways and Means has set tariff and, later, tax rates to maintain the public treasury. As the size and complexity of the federal government grew, the House created the Committee on Appropriations in 1865 to handle all spending matters, and the Budget Committee later in the twentieth century to coordinate America’s finances.

But despite their one-party control of the federal government, Democrats failed to pass President Jimmy Carter’s comprehensive energy program.

By the time the 72nd Congress opened in December 1931, a total of 14 Members-elect had died. The special elections to fill their vacancies before the new term opened would upend the House majority.

Congress Overview Following President Barack Obama’s second inauguration, informal bipartisan talks began in both chambers of the 113th Congress (2013–2015) to craft sweeping immigration reform legislation; these competing efforts proved incompatible and abruptly collapsed mid-Congress.

The founders designed the House of Representatives to represent the people rather than the states, which each send two Members to the U.S. Senate.  Article I, Section II of the Constitution provides each state at least one U.S. Representative, while the size of a state’s delegation to the House depends on its total population.  Based on the 1787 national population, each House Member in the First Federal Congress (1789–1791) represented 30,000 citizens.  As U.S. territory expanded and the population grew, the membership of the House of Representatives increased and individual Members’ constituencies were enlarged. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_inst_apport_2005_122_000.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Introduced in 1873, these small desks allowed even more Members to be crammed into the House Chamber.

Congress Overview Republicans swept the 1994 elections and won control of both the House and Senate during the 104th Congress (1995–1997) for the first time in 40 years. Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia set an ambitious course behind the Republicans’ “Contract with America.” President William J. Clinton vetoed Republican spending and tax cuts, and an ensuing budget impasse resulted in two government shutdowns. In 1996, Congress and the White House compromised on an overhaul of the nation’s welfare system.

The Democratic Whip assists the Democratic leadership in managing the party's legislative program on the House Floor. The Whip provides a
    communications network for the Democratic Members and mobilizes them for important party measures coming up for a vote. The title comes from Great Britain where the House of Commons has had party “whips” since the late 18th century. The British Parliament
    borrowed the term from foxhunting where the “whipper in” was the person in charge of keeping the pack of foxhounds together. In the U.S. House, Whips have served as a two-way bridge between the leadership and the rank-and-file. There are 25 people who have served as Democratic Whip. The first Democratic Whip was appointed in 1899 when Democratic Leader James D. Richardson of Tennessee chose Oscar Underwood of Alabama. Incomplete documentation from 1909 to 1921, however, have left no official record of the Democratic Whip during most of those years. For much of its history, the Democratic Whip has been appointed by the Democratic Leader. Beginning with Tony Coelho of California in 1986, the party Whip has been elected by the organizing
    caucus of Democratic Representatives-elect just prior to the start of a new Congress. If the position becomes vacant during a Congress, a new Whip is elected at a subsequent meeting. When Democrats are in the majority, the Whip is the third highest
    position in the caucus, behind the Majority Leader and the Speaker . When in the minority, the Whip is the second highest position behind the Minority Leader. Of the 25 members who have served as Democratic Whip, five later became House Speaker, eight became Democratic Leader, and two moved over to the Senate. The Democratic
    Whip organization has also grown over time as the legislative agenda became busier and the issues of national governance grew more complex.

Congress Overview Republicans resoundingly won control of both chambers of the 54th Congress (1895–1897) amid a deepening economic depression, but President Grover Cleveland’s fearless use of the veto, tempered the new majority’s ambition.

Congress also lifted the ban on former Confederate officials, soldiers, and sailors serving in the armed forces.

The three House Office Buildings constructed over the course of the 20th century each uniquely reflect the challenges and changes faced in their eras. Cannon House Office Building The Cannon House Office Building is the oldest congressional office building. When completed in 1908, these new offices for Members of Congress forever changed how the House of Representatives worked. Longworth House Office Building The desperate need for more workspace for the House of Representatives coincided with a need for jobs during the Great Depression. The modest and economically planned Longworth building addressed both these concerns in the early 1930s. Rayburn House Office Building The years following World War II brought many changes to Congress—both in the business needing attention, and the ways that work was done. The Rayburn Building—by far the largest of the House offices—embraced mid-century modernism and provided space for expanding committees. Where They Worked: Office Assignments The advent of dedicated office space in 1908 changed some of the House’s basic functions. Members now had individual rooms in which to meet constituents, conduct business, and keep legislative files. Some of America’s most notable politicians used the spaces that are still occupied by Representatives today.

Congress Overview Democrats retained control of Congress after the 1962 elections. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Senate approved the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and in the wake of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, the 88th Congress (1963–1965) desegregated public accommodations with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress passed programs to combat the causes of poverty and tackled environmental problems through the Clean Air Act, the Urban Mass Transportation Act, and the Wilderness Act. Congress also granted broad authority to Kennedy’s successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, to use force in Vietnam with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

Since 1789, 89 individual Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have received at least one Electoral College vote in the race for President or Vice President. The following charts identify these individuals and the office they sought. While many other House Members have organized presidential campaigns, either for a major party or independently, these charts note only those Members whose candidacies led to Electoral College votes. Early in the republic, House Members frequently campaigned for or were rewarded with places on presidential tickets. The 1824 election featured three former, current, and future Representatives all running and receiving Electoral College votes for President, culminating in an indecisive election that was sent to the House of Representatives. Each candidate ran as a Democratic-Republican and received sharply divided regional support, resulting in the controversial House compromise in 1825. House Members running on presidential tickets declined with the rise of the Senate in the 1840s and 1850s, then narrowed further with the crystallization of the two-party structure in the 1870s. Over time, voters placed an increasing importance on governance over legislating experience in the nation’s highest office, and as a result, many more candidates were likely to be former governors or military leaders rather than legislators. However, the House of Representatives remains a fertile ground for future presidential and vice-presidential candidates, as the accompanying charts demonstrate. /tiles/non-collection/p/p_cb_presidents_garfield_hc.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object The only individual to be elected President directly after serving in the House of Representatives, James Garfield of Ohio served nine terms in the House.

Congress Overview The 14th Congress (1815–1817) met near the Capitol ruins where carpenters and enslaved laborers had begun rebuilding it after the British burned it during the war. This Congress strengthened the army and navy, authorized the Second Bank of the United States, and passed a revenue-generating protective tariff. South Carolina Representative John Calhoun sponsored a bill to create a national transportation infrastructure that President James Madison vetoed. Members of Congress shifted their compensation from a per diem to a session basis but reversed themselves during the lame-duck session when voters—believing it to be a raid on the Treasury—cried foul.

Congress Overview Democrats’ large congressional majorities grew after the 1934 elections in a potent endorsement of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “New Deal.” The 74th Congress addressed the long-term social safety-net as the Great Depression persisted. The Supreme Court found many of FDR’s programs unconstitutional, but congressional Democrats continued passing reform legislation. Congress encouraged collective bargaining, created Social Security, regulated public utilities, and provided for rural electrification. Congress also passed the Neutrality Act, which prohibited arms exportation during wartime, in response to charges that weapons manufacturers were responsible for World War I.

Records indicate that Representative John J. O’Connor of New York, chairman of the House Rules Committee, served as acting Majority Leader during the 14 remaining days of the 74th Congress. O’Connor does not, however, appear to have been formally elected Majority Leader at that time and, therefore, is not included in this list. At the commencement of the 75th Congress, Representatives Samuel (Sam) Rayburn, James O’Connor, John Rankin, and others competed for the post of Majority Leader. Representative Rayburn ultimately was elected by the Democratic Caucus.

Congress Overview Republicans continued to control Congress, but the 1902 elections slightly eroded their House majority. With the retirement of Iowa’s David Henderson , Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois won election as House Speaker. The 58th Congress (1903–1905) enabled the Forest Service to better protect lumber reserves. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt announced his “corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. This policy meant the U.S. would act to prevent European creditor powers from invading Latin American nations at risk of defaulting on their debts.

Congress Overview The 12th Congress (1811–1813) faced two major threats as Great Britain and France continued to disrupt American trade, and the western American Indian tribes began mobilizing against the U.S. under the direction of the Shawnee leader, Tecumseh. A new generation of congressional leaders, such as Henry Clay of Kentucky (elected Speaker on his first day in the House) and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, championed an aggressive response to the crises. Their legislation authorized the expansion of the armed services, but by the time America went to war with Great Britain in 1812, the country remained ill-prepared.

In this 1943 Joint Session, network microphones surround the podium. Samuel Morse sent the first telegraph message from the Capitol to Baltimore, MD. Later some of the Nation's first telephone lines were placed in Washington, D.C. The House was more cautious about embracing radio and television on the House Floor. Although special events were occasionally televised , the first broadcast of legislative proceedings did not take place until 1977.  After 175 years of considering various systems, the House conducted its first electronic vote in 1973.  The computer revolution spread around the world in the 1990s and the House of Representatives was quick to join in 1993 with the first Internet , e-mail constituent service. In the more than 150 years since Congress embraced electronic technology to facilitate the business of the House and communicate with the country each development has made the legislative process more accessible to Americans.

Congress Overview The Franco-English war spilled into the Atlantic as both sides restricted neutral shipping. In response, President Thomas Jefferson urged Congress to embargo all U.S. trade with the belligerents as long as the war raged. Congress quickly passed the Embargo Act, but rampant smuggling soon led to an Enforcement Act that greatly extended the police power of the federal government. Just days before President Jefferson left office, Congress replaced the embargo with the Nonintercourse Act. It banned trade with Great Britain and France until one or both recognized neutral shipping rights. The Franco-English war spilled into the Atlantic as both sides restricted neutral shipping.

Hispanic Americans in Congress: An Introduction Over the last two centuries, Hispanic Americans have worked their way from the outer edges to the inner rings of power in Congress. They have represented diverse areas from Territorial New Mexico to the island of Puerto Rico. Since 1899, at least one Hispanic American has served in every Congress. These Members make up an important but often over-looked chapter of the American experience. From Democracy's Borderlands, 1822–1898 Shaped by America’s continental expansion and its geopolitical upheaval, many of the earliest Hispanic Americans to serve in Congress did so as Delegates from the New Mexico Territory. They often confronted racial prejudices, as well as statutes and House Rules limiting their powers as legislators. Though these Members often served only briefly, they worked to weave the western territories into the national fabric. “Foreign in a Domestic Sense,” 1898–1945 Following the Spanish-American War, the United States gained territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean, forcing Congress to change how it administered the country’s insular affairs. While Puerto Rico’s relationship with the U.S. remained unclear, the creation of the Office of the Resident Commissioner gave the island a modest voice in the House. Other Hispanic Members used influential committee assignments to bolster the economy during the Great Depression, and to articulate common concerns. Separate Interests to National Agendas, 1945–1977 Many Hispanic Members launched trailblazing careers after World War II. While fostering grassroots activism, they expanded the boundaries of U.S. citizenship and protected civil liberties. And with the creation of the Estado Libre Asociado, Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner helped the island win a greater measure of self-governance. These bold efforts culminated in the creation of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Strength in Numbers, Challenges in Diversity, 1977–2012 Large-scale demographic changes increased power at the ballot box as nearly 60 percent of all Hispanic Americans to serve in Congress won election after 1977. These Members chaired numerous committees and subcommittees, and served as congressional leaders. They were often at the forefront of key issues: voting rights, bilingual education, foreign policy, and America’s immigration system.

The officers’ duties are prescribed both by law and Rule II of the Rules of the House of Representatives. Oral History Muftiah McCartin: First Female Parliamentarian Oral History The House Radio-TV Gallery and the House Parliamentarians Parliamentarians of the House /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_parls_2002_006_012.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Parliamentarian and former Member Clarence Cannon wrote a book of House precedents that bears his name. The Parliamentarian is a nonpartisan official appointed by the Speaker of the House to render objective assistance on legislative and parliamentary procedure to the House of Representatives. During proceedings on the floor, the Parliamentarian sits to the Speaker’s right on the dais. There have been 21 individuals who have served as Parliamentarian. The parliamentary law of the House of Representatives derives from the Constitution and rules adopted pursuant to Article I, section five of the Constitution. These rules include not only the standing rules adopted from Congress to Congress but also Jefferson's Manual , as customarily incorporated by reference in the standing rules. They also include rules enacted as law and special rules adopted as necessary. On this foundation rests a body of precedent established by decisions of presiding officers on actual parliamentary questions or by long custom and tradition. In resolving questions of order, the Speaker and other presiding officers of the House adhere to the jurisprudential principle of stare decisis, a commitment to stand by earlier decisions. The overarching role of the Office of the Parliamentarian is to strive for consistency in parliamentary analysis by attempting to apply pertinent precedent to each procedural question. Persons who performed various aspects of the Parliamentarian's duties held a series of titles throughout congressional history, including “Messenger to the Speaker,” “Clerk to the Speaker,” and “Clerk at the Speaker's Table.” Beginning in the 70th Congress (1927–1929) the title became “Parliamentarian.” Since 1857, 21 individuals have served in that role. Four also served as Members of the U.S. House of Representatives (Goodwin, Crisp, Hinds, and Cannon) and one as a Senator (Clark). The Office of the Parliamentarian biennially publishes an annotated House Rules and Manual.  Former Parliamentarians Asher Hinds, Clarence Cannon, and Lewis Deschler each compiled parliamentary precedents of the House that remain invaluable records of its proceedings. These precedents fill 26 volumes comprising thousands of decisions over the more than two centuries of parliamentary practice in the House. They are published as Hinds’ Precedents (1907); Cannon’s Precedents (1936); and Deschler’s Precedents (1977).   The Parliamentarian and its subsidiary Office of Compilation of Precedents continue the perennial compilation of parliamentary precedents for formal publication.  The current series, known simply as “Precedents of the United States House of Representatives,” comprises three volumes to date, with subsequent volumes to be published on a regular basis.  To bridge the span between a digest of decisions and formally published precedents, the Parliamentarian also publishes a condensed compilation of procedures of current application as House Practice. /tiles/non-collection/i/im_people_parls_2002_006_012.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object Parliamentarian and former Member Clarence Cannon wrote a book of House precedents that bears his name.

Congress Overview Democratic majorities in Congress eroded after the 1978 elections. The 96th Congress (1979–1981) continued to struggle with energy legislation amid rising support for deficit reduction. The year-long Iranian revolution and subsequent hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran often overshadowed serious economic problems. Immediately before their mass suicide at a South American commune, followers of cult leader Jim Jones murdered California Representative Leo J. Ryan during his investigation of the compound in Guyana.

On January 6, 1969, Democratic Representative James O’Hara of Michigan took a seat on the House Floor for what seemed like a routine day of business. The new 91st Congress (1969–1971) had been sworn in three days earlier and, as required by the Constitution, the House and Senate had gathered on the sixth in a Joint Session to count the votes in the Electoral College following the presidential election in the fall of 1968. There was no question about the outcome: former Republican Vice President Richard M. Nixon had decisively defeated the incumbent Vice President Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Alabama Governor George Wallace for the presidency. The Joint Meeting would simply make it official. Since the late nineteenth century, the Electoral College count had occurred every four years without incident. This year, however, would be different. Shortly after 1:00 p.m., tellers from the House and Senate began examining the election certificates of each state. The count had gone smoothly until the tellers announced that North Carolina’s electors had cast 12 votes for Nixon and one vote for Wallace. O’Hara stood from his seat. “For what purpose does the gentleman from Michigan rise?” the acting president of the Senate, who oversaw the vote count, asked. “For the purpose of objecting to the counting of the vote of North Carolina,” O’Hara answered. It was the first time in American history that a Member of Congress filed a formal objection during the count of the Electoral College. The Electoral College The Electoral College is the system by which America chooses its President, and it is as old as the country itself. During the Constitutional Convention, as the Founders designed a government for the new nation, disagreements emerged over how to elect the President. Some in attendance favored a national popular vote, while others wanted Congress to select the chief executive. Their compromise—the Electoral College—was something of a hybrid. Under this system, when Americans vote for President, they technically do not vote for a candidate but instead for a slate of electors who promise to vote for that candidate in the Electoral College. The candidate who wins a majority of the vote in the Electoral College wins the presidency. (The candidate who wins the popular vote can still lose the Electoral College, as has happened five times in American history.) Since 1961, the Electoral College has been made up of 538 electors : each state has the same number of electors as it does Senators and Representatives in Congress (for a total of 535), plus three electors from the District of Columbia. In the modern era, state political parties choose their electors, usually through a convention or party committee. Almost anyone can serve as an elector, except those who hold a federally elected or appointed position. In all but two states, the presidential candidate who wins the most votes on Election Day wins the entirety of that state’s vote in the Electoral College; Maine and Nebraska use systems based on pluralities in their specific congressional districts. /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-1877Election-2005_218_008.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object This cover of the March 3, 1877, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper shows the Senators of the Electoral Commission bringing the electoral certificates under investigation to the House Chamber. Electors meet to vote in their states on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. The votes are recorded on election certificates, signed by the electors and state governors, and sent to Congress and the National Archives. Many states use strict rules and the threat of fines to “bind” electors to the candidate to whom they pledged their vote. The Constitution does, however, allow electors to change their vote. When they do, they are known as “faithless electors.” Faithless electors have occurred in eight presidential contests but they have never swayed the outcome. Once states send their Electoral College results to Congress, the House and Senate gather in a Joint Session to certify the election. The incumbent Vice President presides over the count, while four tellers—two from the House, two from the Senate—tally the votes. The 1876 Election The Electoral College has failed to determine the outcome of three presidential elections . Following the first two occurrences—a tie in the Electoral College in 1800, and then in 1824 when no candidate won a majority—the House of Representatives, as required by the Constitution, settled the contest. But in 1876, when neither Ohio Republican Governor Rutherford B. Hayes nor New York Democratic Governor Samuel Tilden captured the 185 votes in the Electoral College then required to win, Congress opted for something different. The result of the 1876 presidential election hinged on the contested returns from three southern states: Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina. The elections that year saw former Confederates and white Democrats violently suppress Black and Republican voters to overthrow the biracial coalitions that had governed the states in the 11 years since the Civil War . As a result, the outgoing Republican administrations in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina sent Electoral College returns to Congress showing Hayes had won, while the incoming Democratic governors sent election results showing Tilden had won. Republicans on Capitol Hill refused to count the Democratic returns. In response, congressional Democrats challenged the constitutionality of an elector from Oregon. Congress suddenly faced a constitutional crisis. Because a combined twenty votes in the Electoral College from those four states remained contested, neither Hayes nor Tilden had been declared victorious. Hayes had 165 votes in the Electoral College and Tilden fell one short with 184. At the time, Democrats controlled the House and Republicans controlled the Senate. But rather than allow the House to determine the winner, Congress created the Federal Electoral Commission in January 1877—a temporary bipartisan tribunal made of Senators, Representatives, and Supreme Court Justices. Following weeks of testimony and debate, the commission declared Hayes the winner. Known as the “Compromise of 1877,” Democrats accepted the commission’s decision with the promise that Hayes would remove federal troops from the South who had been monitoring elections. With Republicans having ceded control of southern state governments to Democrats and former Confederates, the rigid and violent system of Jim Crow segregation took root across the region where it remained for another century. /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-ElectoralCommission-LoC.xml Image courtesy of the Library of Congress This image, which appeared in Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper on March 10, 1877, shows the Electoral Commission meeting by candle light in the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol. Electoral Count Act of 1887 Hoping to avoid a repeat of the legitimacy crisis of 1876 election, Congress passed the Electoral Count Act in 1887. The Electoral Count Act left it to the states to settle front-end Electoral College issues, including the selection of electors and the methods used to bind them to pledged candidates. But once the process reached Congress, the law gave Members the power to object to a vote if they believed it had not been “regularly given”—parliamentary speak for votes with particular discrepancies, those cast on the wrong day or for an ineligible candidate, or for votes suspected of being part of a bribery scheme. In order to challenge a vote in the Electoral College, the Electoral Count Act requires one Representative and one Senator to sign an objection together and present it to Congress during the Joint Session. The counting procedure then halts, and the House and Senate gather in their respective chambers for debate. The Electoral Count Act limits the debate on the objection to two hours and only allows Members to speak for up to five minutes. Both houses of Congress must agree to the objection in order to void the electoral vote in question. For decades, the act sat largely unused. But 82 years after the Electoral Count Act became law, James O’Hara of Michigan invoked it to challenge the result of the 1968 presidential election. The 1968 Presidential Election During the 1968 presidential election, former Vice President, Republican Richard M. Nixon, faced the incumbent Vice President Democrat Hubert Humphrey and a third candidate, Alabama Governor George Wallace, who ran as an Independent. Wallace was an ardent segregationist who opposed Black civil rights and had little chance of winning the presidency. But he devised a plan that he hoped would enable him to wield influence over the next administration. Wallace believed that if he captured enough votes in the Electoral College to prevent both Nixon and Humphrey from capturing a majority, he could play powerbroker by instructing his delegates to vote for whichever candidate promised to enact his preferred policies. It was a quid pro quo not unlike Hayes’s promise to Democrats to pull federal troops out of the South in 1877. /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-1969Count-NARA.xml Image courtesy of the National Archives and Records Administration The clerk tallying the official electoral count for the 1968 presidential election needed to write in the number of votes for North Carolina after the House and Senate debated the objection to the faithless elector. Initially it seemed as though Wallace’s plan could work. Even late into the fall of 1968, there was little indication that either Humphrey or Nixon would win a majority of the Electoral College. But Nixon ultimately won the presidency with room to spare, taking 301 votes in the Electoral College but with only a slim plurality of the popular vote. Humphrey captured 191 votes and Wallace 46. By January 6, 1969, the country was preparing for a Republican inauguration. The Faithless Elector When Congress gathered to count the Electoral College in a Joint Meeting on January 6, 1969, Vice President Humphrey was overseas attending the funeral of Trygve Lie, the United Nation’s first secretary general. In Humphrey’s absence, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, the president pro tempore of the Senate, oversaw the proceedings. Two mahogany boxes containing the Electoral College certificates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia sat in front of him on the House rostrum. When Russell pulled the North Carolina election certificate from the box, Senator Benjamin Jordan of North Carolina stated it was “regular in form and authentic.” Jordan announced that Nixon had received 12 votes for President and that Wallace had received one vote. After Jordan finished speaking, O’Hara and Democratic Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine—Humphrey’s vice-presidential running mate—filed their objection to North Carolina’s certificate. Specifically, they objected to a faithless elector—the kind of elector Wallace had hoped to use to swing the outcome of a close presidential contest. Except in this case the faithless elector in question—Dr. Lloyd W. Bailey of Rocky Mount, North Carolina—had voted for Wallace despite his initial pledge to support Nixon. Bailey’s vote for Wallace was not unconstitutional, it did not break North Carolina law, and it did not sway the outcome of the election. Bailey said he broke from Nixon because Wallace “polled a large vote in his area,” and he believed the Electoral College allowed “checks and balances which guarantee that the minority voice be heard.” But O’Hara and Muskie wanted Congress to reject Bailey’s vote to discourage faithless electors in the future. They objected, they said, to maintain “the integrity of this election under the present system  and to effectively dramatize the dangers of continuing to operate under this outmoded, haphazard and undemocratic method of electing a President.” Following O’Hara’s and Muskie’s objection, the Joint Session recessed to allow the House and Senate to consider the issue separately. In the House, James Wright Jr. of Texas opened debate in support of O’Hara’s objection, arguing that faithless electors threatened the democratic process. Such “kingmakers,” as they were known, would become the norm. “Shall we declare that [the people] have no authority whatever to require that their votes be faithfully reflected by their agents, the electors—no right, no remedy, no resource and no protection against the faithless elector who betrays their trust, abuses his office, disdains their wishes, and cavalierly substitutes his will for theirs?” /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-69JointSession-Collection.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object As President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator Richard Russell announced Richard M. Nixon the winner of the 1968 presidential election, after the House and Senate debated the objection of a North Carolina elector’s vote. Others, like veteran lawmaker William McCulloch of Ohio, defended faithless electors. “Today, the objectors ask us to circumvent the [constitutional] amending process. They ask us to do what we have criticized so often before—to read into the Constitution what we wish the law to be. . . . They ask us to adopt a view which not only differs from but which is diametrically opposed to the way the Constitution was written.” Citing the 1876 election, McCulloch argued the objection process should be reserved for cases when Congress received two sets of returns. “But once the real set is determined, the votes must be counted,” he said. “Nothing in title III [of the Electoral Count Act] empowers Congress to change or disregard votes because an elector has been unfaithful.” O’Hara sat quietly during most of the debate. He rose in the closing minutes to say, “Only the Congress can see to it that the elector respects his obligations, and the only way we can do it is by sustaining the objection that the junior Senator from Maine, Senator Muskie, and I have filed.” The House ultimately rejected O’Hara and Muskie’s objection, 228 to 170, as did the Senate, 58 to 33. When Congress resumed the Joint Session at 4:45 p.m., Senator Russell announced that “the original certificate submitted by the State of North Carolina will be counted and provided therein.” /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-Tubbs-Jones-Collection.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives Ohio Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones challenged the electoral vote count in 2005 with Senator Barbara Boxer. The Second Objection The only other time a Member of Congress objected to a vote in the Electoral College happened 36 years later, on January 6, 2005, during the Joint Session to certify Republican George W. Bush’s re-election as President. Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio objected to all the Electoral College votes from her home state citing what she described as widespread  voting irregularities, particularly in low-income and African-American neighborhoods. Senator Barbara Boxer of California co-signed the objection. “This objection . . . is a necessary, timely, and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy,” Jones told her House colleagues at the start of the debate. “I raise the objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people.” Ultimately, Congress rejected Jones’s objection. Amending the Process O’Hara’s challenge to a faithless elector in 1969 occurred amid a broader effort to reform how America selected its President. Although O’Hara’s objection failed, many in Congress supported its intent. The House Majority Whip, Democrat Hale Boggs of Louisiana, backed a constitutional amendment to “once and for all get rid of this anachronistic provision” concerning faithless electors. House Minority Leader Republican Gerald Ford of Michigan called for quick action as well. But other Members wanted to go farther. “It is important that we keep the pressure on for reform,” House Republican Conference chair John B. Anderson of Illinois, told the Los Angeles Times . “I for one would abolish the Electoral College rather than simply try to apply a Band-Aid.” In fact, in 1969 the House approved a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College, but the bill failed in the Senate. Still, O’Hara had been optimistic for reform. “While we had hoped to establish a precedent that might have deterred future faithless electors,” O’Hara later said about his objection, “the purpose of that challenge was in part educational—to once again remind the public and the Congress of the power of the presidential electors, and the danger inherent in that power.” Sources: Congressional Record , House, 91st Congress, 1st sess.

On January 6, 1969, Democratic Representative James O’Hara of Michigan took a seat on the House Floor for what seemed like a routine day of business. The new 91st Congress (1969–1971) had been sworn in three days earlier and, as required by the Constitution, the House and Senate had gathered on the sixth in a Joint Session to count the votes in the Electoral College following the presidential election in the fall of 1968. There was no question about the outcome: former Republican Vice President Richard M. Nixon had decisively defeated the incumbent Vice President Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Alabama Governor George Wallace for the presidency. The Joint Meeting would simply make it official. /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-Ohara-Collection.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives Michigan Representative James O’Hara was the first to challenge the electoral vote count under the Electoral Count Act of 1887 in 1969. Since the late nineteenth century, the Electoral College count had occurred every four years without incident. This year, however, would be different. Shortly after 1:00 p.m., tellers from the House and Senate began examining the election certificates of each state. The count had gone smoothly until the tellers announced that North Carolina’s electors had cast 12 votes for Nixon and one vote for Wallace. O’Hara stood from his seat. “For what purpose does the gentleman from Michigan rise?” the acting president of the Senate, who oversaw the vote count, asked. “For the purpose of objecting to the counting of the vote of North Carolina,” O’Hara answered. It was the first time in American history that a Member of Congress filed a formal objection during the count of the Electoral College. The Electoral College The Electoral College is the system by which America chooses its President, and it is as old as the country itself. During the Constitutional Convention, as the Founders designed a government for the new nation, disagreements emerged over how to elect the President. Some in attendance favored a national popular vote, while others wanted Congress to select the chief executive. Their compromise—the Electoral College—was something of a hybrid. Under this system, when Americans vote for President, they technically do not vote for a candidate but instead for a slate of electors who promise to vote for that candidate in the Electoral College. The candidate who wins a majority of the vote in the Electoral College wins the presidency. (The candidate who wins the popular vote can still lose the Electoral College, as has happened five times in American history.) Since 1961, the Electoral College has been made up of 538 electors : each state has the same number of electors as it does Senators and Representatives in Congress (for a total of 535), plus three electors from the District of Columbia. In the modern era, state political parties choose their electors, usually through a convention or party committee. Almost anyone can serve as an elector, except those who hold a federally elected or appointed position. In all but two states, the presidential candidate who wins the most votes on Election Day wins the entirety of that state’s vote in the Electoral College; Maine and Nebraska use systems based on pluralities in their specific congressional districts. /tiles/non-collection/1/11-17-1877Election-2005_218_008.xml Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives About this object This cover of the March 3, 1877, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper shows the Senators of the Electoral Commission bringing the electoral certificates under investigation to the House Chamber. Electors meet to vote in their states on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. The votes are recorded on election certificates, signed by the electors and state governors, and sent to Congress and the National Archives. Many states use strict rules and the threat of fines to “bind” electors to the candidate to whom they pledged their vote. The Constitution does, however, allow electors to change their vote. When they do, they are known as “faithless electors.” Faithless electors have occurred in eight presidential contests but they have never swayed the outcome. Once states send their Electoral College results to Congress, the House and Senate gather in a Joint Session to certify the election. The incumbent Vice President presides over the count, while four tellers—two from the House, two from the Senate—tally the votes. The 1876 Election The Electoral College has failed to determine the outcome of three presidential elections . Following the first two occurrences—a tie in the Electoral College in 1800, and then in 1824 when no candidate won a majority—the House of Representatives, as required by the Constitution, settled the contest. But in 1876, when neither Ohio Republican Governor Rutherford B. Hayes nor New York Democratic Governor Samuel Tilden captured the 185 votes in the Electoral College then required to win, Congress opted for something different. The result of the 1876 presidential election hinged on the contested returns from three southern states: Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina. The elections that year saw former Confederates and white Democrats violently suppress Black and Republican voters to overthrow the biracial coalitions that had governed the states in the 11 years since the Civil War . As a result, the outgoing Republican administrations in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina sent Electoral College returns to Congress showing Hayes had won, while the incoming Democratic governors sent election results showing Tilden had won.

The Commission, seen here meeting by candle light in the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol, awarded all the disputed ballots to Rutherford B. Hayes, who became President by a single electoral vote. The founders struggled for months to devise a way to select the President and Vice President. Gouverneur Morris , a delegate from Pennsylvania, compared the Federal Constitutional Convention’s debates on this issue to the Greek epic The Odyssey . “When this article was under consideration in the National Convention it was observed, that every mode of electing the chief magistrate of a powerful nation hitherto adopted is liable to objection,” Morris recounted in an 1802 letter. /tiles/non-collection/i/i_origins_electoral_leslie_lc.xml Image courtesy of the Library of Congress The Electoral Commission comprised of House Members, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices investigated the disputed Electoral College ballots from the South after the 1876 presidential election. The Commission, seen here meeting by candle light in the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol, awarded all the disputed ballots to Rutherford B. Hayes, who became President by a single electoral vote. Constitutional Framing Various methods for selecting the executive were offered, reviewed, and discarded during the Constitutional Convention: legislative; direct; gubernatorial; electoral; and lottery. A decision resulted only late in the Convention, when the Committee of Detail presented executive election by special electors selected by the state legislatures. This compromise preserved states’ rights, increased the independence of the executive branch, and avoided popular election. In this plan, Congress plays a formal role in the election of the President and Vice President. While Members of Congress are expressly forbidden from being electors, the Constitution requires the House and Senate to count the Electoral College’s ballots, and in the event of a tie, to select the President and Vice President, respectively. The House Decides: 1801 The provisions for electing the President and Vice President have been among the most amended in the Constitution. Initially, electors voted for two individuals without differentiating between the ballot for President and Vice President. The winner of the largest bloc of votes, so long as it was a majority of all the votes cast, would win the presidency. The individual with the second largest number of votes would become Vice President. In 1796, this meant that John Adams became President and Thomas Jefferson became Vice President despite opposing each other for the presidency. The 1800 presidential election further tested the presidential selection system when Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the Republican candidates for President and Vice President, tied at 73 electoral ballots each. The House, under the Constitution, then chose between Jefferson and Burr for President. The Constitution mandates that House Members vote as a state delegation and that the winner must obtain a simple majority of the states. The House deadlocked at eight states for Jefferson, six for Burr, and two tied. After six days of debate and 36 ballots, Jefferson won 10 state delegations in the House when the Burr supporters in the two tied states (Vermont and Maryland) filed blank ballots rather than support Jefferson. The 12th Amendment After the experiences of the 1796 and 1800 elections, Congress passed, and the states ratified, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. Added in time for the 1804 election, the amendment stipulated that the electors would now cast two votes: one for President and the other for Vice President. While states varied in how they selected presidential electors through the 19th century, electors today are uniformly popularly elected (rather than appointed) and pledged to support a given candidate. The House Decides Again: 1825 Since the 12th Amendment, one other presidential election has come to the House. In 1824, Andrew Jackson of Tennessee won a plurality of the national popular vote and 99 votes in the Electoral College—32 short of a majority. John Quincy Adams was runner-up with 85, and Treasury Secretary William Crawford had 41. Speaker of the House Henry Clay had 37 and expected to use his influence in the House to win election. But the 12th Amendment required the House to consider only the top-three vote-getters when no one commands an overall majority. The House chose Adams over Jackson. And when Adams made Clay Secretary of State, Jackson said the two had struck a corrupt bargain. “[T]he Judas of the West has closed the contract and will receive the thirty pieces of silver . . . Was there ever witnessed such a bare faced corruption in any country before?” Jackson said. Congress Decides: 1877 The contested 1876 presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York was the last to require congressional intervention . Tilden won the popular vote and the electoral count. But Republicans challenged the results in three Southern states, which submitted certificates of election for both candidates. While the Constitution requires the House and Senate to formally count the certificates of election in joint session, it is silent on what Congress should do to resolve disputes. In January 1877, Congress established the Federal Electoral Commission to investigate the disputed Electoral College ballots. The bipartisan commission, which included Representatives, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices, voted along party lines to award all the contested ballots to Hayes—securing the presidency for him by a single electoral vote. The Commission’s controversial results did not spark the violence in the post-Civil War South that some had feared largely because Republicans had struck a compromise with Southern Democrats to remove federal soldiers from the South and end Reconstruction in the event of a Hayes victory.

The bill became effective on January 9, 2022, as Local Law 11, after both outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio and incoming Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed it. Local Law 11 permitted certain noncitizens to vote in elections for New York City offices such as Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President, and City Council Member. Plaintiffs, including current and former elected officials and New York City registered voters, filed a lawsuit against the New York City Council, Mayor Eric Adams, and the New York City Board of Elections. They sought to declare Local Law 11 null and void, arguing it violated the New York State Constitution, the New York State Election Law, and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The Supreme Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on all grounds, declaring Local Law 11 unconstitutional and enjoining its implementation. The Appellate Division modified the judgment regarding the Election Law claim but otherwise affirmed the decision, with one justice dissenting. The City Council and intervenors appealed to the Court of Appeals. The New York Court of Appeals held that Article II, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution restricts voting to citizens, thus invalidating Local Law 11. The court found that the Constitution's language and historical context clearly limit the right to vote to U.S. citizens. The court rejected arguments that Article IX of the Constitution, which grants home rule powers to local governments, overrides this restriction. Consequently, the Court of Appeals modified the Appellate Division's order and, as modified, affirmed the decision, maintaining the invalidation of Local Law 11.

On December 9, 2021, the New York City Council passed a bill entitled "A Local Law to amend the New York city charter, in relation to allowing lawful permanent residents in New York city to vote in municipal elections." Shortly thereafter, Mayor Bill de Blasio left office without signing or vetoing the bill. Upon taking office on January 1, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams also neither signed nor vetoed it. Accordingly, pursuant to section 37 (b) of the New York City Charter, the bill became effective on January 9, 2022 as Local Law 11. Local Law 11 granted some noncitizens the right to vote in certain elections for elective offices in New York City. The same day Local Law 11 became effective through Mayoral inaction, plaintiffs brought this action seeking to declare Local Law 11 null and void on the grounds that it violates the New York State Constitution, the New York State Election Law, and the Municipal Home Rule Law. We hold that Article II, Section 1 of our Constitution limits voting to citizens, and affirm on that ground. I. Local Law 11 allows "municipal voters" to vote in New York City elections for the offices of Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and City Council Member (New York City Charter §§ 1057-aa, 1057-bb). The law defines a municipal voter as "a person who is not a United States citizen on the date of the election on which he or she is voting," and who: (1) "is either a lawful permanent resident or authorized to work in the United States"; (2) "is a resident of New York city and will have been such a resident for 30 consecutive days or longer by the date of such election"; and (3) "meets all qualifications for registering or preregistering to vote under the election law, except for possessing United States citizenship, and who has registered or preregistered to vote with the board of elections in the city of New York under this chapter" ( id. at § 1057-aa [a]). Plaintiffs, a group of current and former elected officials, individuals and entities representing or associated with the Republican Party, and a group of New York City registered voters, brought this action against the New York City Council, Mayor Eric Adams and the New York City Board of Elections. Plaintiffs challenged the law and sought declaratory judgment on three bases: First, that Article II, section 1 of New York's Constitution limits voting to citizens; second, that Election Law § 5-102 (1), which does the same by providing that "[n]o person shall be qualified to register for and vote at any election unless he is a citizen of the United States," cannot be superseded by a local law; and third, that Local Law 11 violates Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 (2) (e) because it constitutes a change to the "method" of voting, a change which requires a public referendum that was not conducted here [FN1] . A group of noncitizens who qualified as municipal voters under Local Law 11 intervened as defendants to support its constitutionality. Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on all three grounds, granted the requested declaratory judgments, and permanently enjoined the City from implementing the law. The Appellate Division modified the judgment as to the Election Law claim, and, as so modified, affirmed, with a single justice dissenting (225 AD3d 98 [2024]). The City Council and Intervenors appealed as of right to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1). II. A. The first question is whether Article II, section 1 of New York's Constitution limits voting to citizens. The text of that Article makes clear what our case law has long held: Article II, section 1 restricts voting to citizens. "[W]e [are] guided by the familiar principle of our jurisprudence that the courts are reluctant, and it is only as a last resort, that they will strike down a solemn legislative enactment on the ground that it is unconstitutional" ( Matter of Ahern v South Buffalo Ry. Co. , 303 NY 545, 555 [1952]). That principle applies to local legislative enactments as well as those of the state legislature ( see e.g. , Police Benevolent Assn. of the City of New York, Inc. v City of New York , 40 NY3d 417, 427 [2023]; Lighthouse Shores, Inc. v Town of Islip , 41 NY2d 7, 11 [1976]). "The question in determining the constitutionality of a legislative action is therefore not whether the State Constitution permits the act, but whether it prohibits it" ( Stefanik , [*2]___NY3d___, 2024 NY Slip Op 04236, *3). It is the "responsibility of the courts" to define the rights and prohibitions set forth in the State Constitution, "which constrain the activities of all three branches" of the government ( Board of Educ, Levittown Union Free School Dist. v Nyquist , 57 NY2d 27, 39 [1982]). Reading Article II as a whole, it is facially clear that only citizens may vote in elections within the State of New York. Article II of the Constitution governs "Suffrage." Section 1, titled "Qualifications of voters," states, "Every citizen shall be entitled to vote at every election for all officers elected by the people and upon all questions submitted to the vote of the people provided that such citizen is eighteen years of age or over and shall have been a resident of this state, and of the county, city, or village for thirty days next preceding an election" (NY Const, art II, § 1). Appellants urge that Article II, section 1 merely provides a floor, guaranteeing that citizens may vote in all elections but not prohibiting voting by others. Under that interpretation, municipalities are free to enact legislation that would enable anyone to vote—including, as counsel for appellants stated during oral argument, thirteen-year-old children. That reading is incompatible with other portions of Article II. [FN2] Section 5 requires the promulgation of laws "for ascertaining, by proper proofs, the citizens who shall be entitled to the right of suffrage hereby established." Likewise, section 7 provides that "all elections by the citizens . . . shall be by ballot." [FN3] Under appellants' construction, municipalities must require citizens to vote by ballot, but would be unfettered in the means they decide to use for noncitizen voting. Each of those constitutional provisions presumes that the franchise is limited to citizens. If the Constitution guaranteed the right of suffrage to persons other than citizens, it would be unusual, to say the least, to set forth requirements to ascertain proper proofs and to vote by ballot that apply to only citizens and not noncitizens. Instead, it is plain from the language and restrictions contained in Article II that "citizen" is not meant as a floor, but as a condition of voter eligibility: the franchise extends only to citizens whose right to vote is established by proper proofs and who vote by ballot (subject to section 7's exceptions). From Article II's provisions stating that "[e]very citizen shall be entitled to vote" ( id. § 1), that "elections [are] by the citizens" ( id . § 7) and that the legislature's duty and power is to enforce and realize the franchise held by "the citizens who shall be entitled to the right of suffrage hereby established" ( id. § 5), Article II provides for election by—and only by—citizens. That conclusion is hardly new. In People ex rel. Smith v Pease , we explained: "The Constitution of this State declares who may exercise the elective franchise. Those entitled to vote at any election are, every male citizen of the age of twenty-[*3]one years who shall have been a citizen for ten days and an inhabitant of this State for one year next preceding any election, and for the last four months a resident of the county where he may offer his vote. It follows that none others than those possessing these qualifications can lawfully vote" (27 NY 45, 52-53 [1863] [citing 1846 NY Const, art II, § 1]). Our language—that the Constitution declares "who may exercise the elective franchise . . . at any election," and provides that "none others . . . can lawfully vote" ( id. )—is definitive and determinative [FN4] . We reiterated the firm limit restricting voting to citizens in Matter of Hopper v Britt , in which we reiterated that "[t]he qualifications of voters are prescribed by section 1 of article 2 of the Constitution and those qualifications are exclusive" (203 NY 144, 150 [1911]). [FN5] B. Appellants' additional arguments in support of the proposition that Article II is a floor, not a ceiling, are unavailing. First, appellants point to several statutes, enacted before the Civil War, that use the word "inhabitants" rather than "citizens," and suggest those statutes evince a legislative understanding that the Constitution's use of "citizen" was merely a floor. There are several problems with that argument. First, appellants have fundamentally misunderstood those statutes, which disenfranchised citizens who (1) were not inhabitants of a locality where an election would take place; and/or (2) were not taxpayers, even if they were citizens. For example, an 1832 law provided that only "a taxable inhabitant" of Geneseo village could vote on certain ballot propositions in Geneseo village elections (L 1832, ch 217 § 12); an 1842 law provided that no one could vote in a Lansingburgh village election unless he paid a road tax (L 1842, ch 127, § 1); an 1857 law restricted voting in Newport town elections to every "inhabitant" who owned property in or paid taxes to that town (L 1857, ch 148 § 5). It would have been nonsensical to limit voting to "citizens" of Geneseo, Lansingburgh or Newport, because no one is a "citizen" of a town or village. One may "reside," "inhabit" or be otherwise present in a locality, but the use of such words in those statutes cannot be understood as a legislative recognition that the Constitution permitted people other than citizens to vote. Second, the subsequent enactment of these statutes says little or nothing about their constitutionality, which was never tested by any lawsuit in which a noncitizen resident of some municipality attempted to vote. Finally, it takes but a moment to understand that these statutes were designed to disenfranchise citizens, not enfranchise noncitizens. Those statutes limited voting in local elections to inhabitants who paid taxes to a locality as a way of further imposing qualifications on voters—not overruling Article II's meaning of "citizen." Appellants misread our analysis of a similar restriction in Spitzer v Village of Fulton (172 NY 285 [1902]) as suggesting that Article II does not govern local elections. In that case, the plaintiffs sued the Village of Fulton to recover a $1,000 deposit they had paid to secure their performance of a bid to purchase bonds to be issued to finance the Village's construction of municipal water works. The plaintiffs ultimately were awarded the right to purchase the bonds but reneged. The Village refused to return the deposit, retaining it as liquidated damages under the bid terms. The plaintiffs argued that the state statute authorizing the issuance of the bonds violated Article II, section 1 of the Constitution because it placed an additional, [*4]property-ownership requirement to vote at the Village's elections on ballot propositions related to the water works. We held that Article II, section 1 did not prohibit the Legislature from requiring additional voter qualifications in this narrow category of local elections: "The obvious purpose of [Article II] was to prescribe the general qualifications that voters throughout the state were required to possess to authorize them to vote for public officers or upon public questions relating to general governmental affairs. But we are of the opinion that that article was not intended to define the qualifications of voters upon questions relating to the financial interests or private affairs of the various cities or incorporated villages of the state, especially when, as in this case, it relates to borrowing money or contracting debts" ( id. at 289). Far from supporting appellants, Spitzer expressly states that Article II defines the general qualifications to vote even in local elections such as those at issue here. It further holds that, for a limited type of local ballot proposition not at issue here—"financial interests or private affairs . . . [that] relate[] to borrowing money or contracting debts"—Article II does not prohibit the legislature from authorizing local governments to impose certain additional voter-eligibility qualifications beyond citizenship. The elections at issue on this appeal are elections for "public officers or upon public questions relating to general governmental affairs," not for "the financial interests or private affairs" of localities ( id. ). [FN6] Moreover, Spitzer's rationale for determining that the legislature could impose additional requirements in that narrow category rested in part on the 1894 Constitution's Article XII, section 1 (now codified in amended form at Article VIII, section 12), which required the legislature to "provide for the organization of cities and incorporated villages, and to restrict their power of taxation, assessment, borrowing money, contracting debts, and loaning their credit, so as to prevent abuses in assessments and in contracting debt by such municipal corporation." Spitzer read Article II and Article XII together to hold that the additional voter qualifications imposed by the legislature were permissible. The Article XII power on which we relied in Spitzer was moved to Article VIII, section 12 in 1963, adding the following language, inter alia : "The legislature shall not, however, restrict the power to levy taxes on real estate for the payment of interest on or principal of indebtedness therefore contracted." Thus, all we decided in Spitzer was that former Article XII, section 1 authorized the legislature to impose a property-holding restriction for voting in a local election respecting a locality's own "financial interests or private affairs," to ensure that those entitled to vote are the ones "liable to be taxed for the payment of such debts" ( id . at 289-290). It has no application here. [FN7] We note, too, that the text and history of Article II, section 1 do not support the view that it is broadly inapplicable to local governments ( see 4 Charles Z. Lincoln, The Constitutional History of New York at 188-189 [1905] [noting that the People rejected a proposed amendment making explicit that Article II, section 1 applied to ballot question "submitted to the vote of the people of the state," thus preserving the existing understanding that the provision did not "exclude municipal corporations from (its) operation"]). Appellants and the dissent also point to two of our decisions upholding local laws relating to elections for New York City councilmembers. But those cases do not concern who is eligible to vote—they concern for whom eligible voters may vote and the districts in which candidates run. In Johnson v City of New York , we held that Article II, section 1 permitted the removal of district lines within a borough and the limitation that each voter could vote for only one candidate even when multiple seats were at stake ( see 274 NY 411, 416-417 [1937]). Next, Matter of Blaikie v Power rejected the argument that a charter amendment "providing that a voter may vote for only one of the two candidates for the offices of councilmen at large from his borough . . . deprives him of a right to vote for a candidate of his choice for both of the elective offices to be filled and thereby offends against section 1 of article II of our State Constitution" (13 NY2d 134, 139 [1963]). Indeed, in Blaikie , we noted that Johnson "expressly [held] that the purpose of the constitutional provision was solely to remove the disqualifications which attached to the person of the voter in earlier times and thereby assure to a citizen , qualified by age and residence, the same right to vote as every other similarly qualified voter possessed" ( id. at 140 [emphasis added]). [FN8] For the above reasons, we cannot read Article II as providing a floor, allowing municipalities to enfranchise whomever they please. Instead, it precisely defines who may vote, restricting the franchise to citizens. III. The determination that Article II restricts voting to citizens does not resolve this appeal. The next question is whether Article IX of the Constitution, which grants local governments expansive home rule powers, created an exception to Article II's restriction on voting. As appellants correctly point out, Article IX was enacted long after Article II, and it provides that the "[r]ights, powers, privileges and immunities" that it confers on local governments "shall be liberally construed" (NY Const, art IX, § 3 [c]). Additionally, in other contexts we have affirmed that Article IX grants local governments broad powers to manage their own affairs, which can be displaced by the legislature only in ways contemplated by the Constitution ( id. , § 2 [b], [c]; see e.g., Greater N.Y. Taxi Assn. v State of New York , 21 NY3d 289, 300-301 [2013]; DJL Rest. Corp. v City of New York , 96 NY2d 91 [2001]; City of New York v Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. , 89 NY2d 380, 387 [1996]). Appellants and the dissent contend that even if Article II once restricted voting to citizens, Article IX's enactment in 1963 overrode Article II and our decisions in Pease and Hopper —and that if Article II imposed "such a drastic limitation on home rule," it could not do so just by implication (dissenting op at 2, 31). They misread the Constitution. Article IX further reinforces the constitutional bar on noncitizen voting by expressly incorporating Article II, section 1. Article IX, section 1 (a) requires that "[e]very local government, except a county wholly included within a city, shall have a legislative body elective by the people thereof." Article IX, section 1 (b) similarly requires that "[a]ll officers of every local government whose election or appointment is not provided for by [*5]th[e] constitution shall be elected by the people of the local government, or of some division thereof," or appointed by local officials if such appointment is provided for by law. Appellants contend that the Constitution's use of the phrase "elective by the people thereof" instead of "elective by the citizens thereof" overrides Article II's restriction providing that only citizens may vote. The difficulty with that argument is the same as with the pre-Civil War statutes discussed earlier: Article IX uses "elective by the people thereof" and "elected by the people of the local government, or of some division thereof" to impose a geographic restriction so that voters cannot vote for a local official if they do not reside within the locality (NY Const art IX § 1 [a], [b]). The use of the word "people" instead of "citizen" in Article IX does not represent the rejection of citizenship as a necessary condition of voting. Because no one is a citizen of Westchester County, Rochester or any other locality, it would not have made sense for Article IX to say, "elected by the citizens thereof" or "elected by the citizens of the local government." The insuperable problem for appellants' interpretation is that Article IX, section 3 defines "People" as "[p]ersons entitled to vote as provided in section one of article two of this constitution " ( id . § 3 [d] [3]; emphasis added). By expressly defining "People" to refer back to Article II, section 1, which restricts voting to "citizens" only, Article IX not only cabins its own scope to that specified by Article II, section 1, but it also reinforces the understanding that Article II, section 1 states a finite definition of who may vote, not just a floor above which localities can enfranchise other voters. To overcome Article IX's explicit incorporation of Article II's requirement that only citizens may vote, appellants point to the entirety of Article IX's definitional section 3 (d), which reads: "(d) Whenever used in this article the following terms shall mean or include: (1) 'General law.' A law which in terms and in effect applies alike to all counties, all counties other than those wholly included within a city, all cities, all towns or all villages. (2) 'Local government.' A county, city, town or village. (3) 'People.' Persons entitled to vote as provided in section one of article two of this constitution. (4) 'Special law.' A law which in terms and in effect applies to one or more, but not all, counties, counties other than those wholly included within a city, cities, towns or villages" (NY Const, art IX, § 3 [d]). Appellants contend that because the prefatory language uses the phrase "mean or include" and not just "mean," the definitions allow other, unspecified meanings. However, this argument would not make sense if applied to all of the defined terms in section 3. For the definition of "General law" to "include" but not be limited to the definition would render the definition meaningless—a general law would "include" a law that applies alike to all Counties but could "include" any other law ( id . § 3 [d] [1]). Recognizing that problem, although not mentioned in their briefs, appellants suggested at oral argument that "mean or include" may not refer to each of the defined terms that follow it, but only to the definition of "People," because, in their view, that definition is the one most susceptible of an expansive reading. That argument suffers from several defects. First, there is nothing in the text of the section that suggests the prefatory phrase applies only to a subset of the defined terms; the suggestion that it does is an attempt to evade the fact that noncitizen voting makes no sense on the face of the section as written. If, as the dissent urges, we must read the statute exactly as written, there is no basis to choose whether to apply "mean" or "include" to each defined term, and choosing "include" as appellants would makes no sense when applied to at least some of the definitions. Second, there is no reason to think that, if "include" applies to [*6]fewer than all four defined terms, it would most likely be directed at the definition of "People." Unlike the other three defined terms, "People" refers back to a different section of the Constitution that provides a concrete definition. Indeed, if there were any candidate among the four to which "include" might most appropriately apply, it would be the definition of "Local Government," because, beyond the types specifically enumerated (county, city, town or village), there are other forms of local government that might have a legislative body or other officers elected by the people, such as a water district, a garbage district, or a school district. Third, it belies the purpose of a definitions section—already rare in the New York Constitution—if the definitions do not, in fact, fix the meanings of the defined terms. Finally, there are innumerable statutory uses of the phrase "means and includes" (s ee e.g. , Vehicle and Traffic Law § 114-a; General Business Law § 511 (1); Alcohol Beverage Control Law § 3; Tax Law § 186-a). As is the case here, reading "include" as an expansive term would render many such definitions meaningless. Contrary to appellants' proposition, the phrase is used in statutes as a term of art to indicate that a definition is comprehensive, not that "includes" should allow for the expansion beyond the defined terms. Reading "includes" in these many statutes to allow expansion beyond the definitions would render them meaningless. "Means and includes" is similar to legal and colloquial expressions like "whether or not," "cease and desist," "past history," "free gift," "end result" or countless other redundant expressions that have worked their way into common parlance as well as into legal expression. [FN9] The tortuous convolutions appellants would have us suffer to evade the plain language of Article IX demonstrate the unsoundness of their argument. Even the direction to construe Article IX liberally does not authorize erasing the limitations Article IX itself imposes ( see e.g. , Makinen v City of New York , 30 NY3d 81, 88-89 [2017] [command to liberally construe statute cannot overcome statute's plain meaning]). IV. Intervenors and amici New York Civil Liberties Union contend that New York State citizenship is, or at least can be, broader than U.S. citizenship. They point to the New York Constitution's use of "citizen" and "citizen of the United States" in different places as well as to the history of voting by African Americans in New York. They argue that if we read the word "citizen" across the text of the New York Constitution, the text plainly distinguishes between United States citizens and New York citizens. They point to the eleven uses of the word "citizen" with no qualifier and three uses of "citizen of the United States" to suggest that Article II does not require U.S. citizenship to vote. To begin, that argument is disconnected from the issue in this case. Even if someone could be a citizen of New York State without being a citizen of the United States, Local Law 11 does not purport to enfranchise citizens of New York who are not citizens of the United States—it purports to enfranchise noncitizens with no reference to any idea of New York State citizenship. There is no known procedure for someone who is not a citizen of the United States to be a citizen of New York, and, even were there, Local Law 11 does not purport to enfranchise those persons. Article II, section 1 states that "[e]very citizen shall be entitled to vote at every election" (NY Const art II, § 1). Pointing to other constitutional provisions that expressly refer to citizens of the United States ( see e.g. NY Const art I, § 1), the Intervenors and amicus say that "citizen" must mean "citizen of the state." If the provision was intended to limit suffrage to citizens of the United States, so the argument goes, it would include the phrase "citizen of the United States," as other provisions do. But just as it uses "citizen of the United States," the New York Constitution elsewhere specifically refers to "citizens of the state" ( see NY [*7]Const art III, § 19), undermining any argument that the word "citizen," standing alone, necessarily means "citizen of the state." The text alone cannot resolve the meaning of that term. It is, therefore, helpful to review our constitutional history. The requirement that a voter be a "citizen" has existed since 1821, when the State adopted its Second Constitution. Article II, section 1 of that Constitution distinguished between "citizen[s]" and "citizen[s] of this state" (1821 NY Const art II, § 1). That provision imposed additional durational requirements on free people of color residing in the state [FN10] . Although no historical evidence bears on whether the framers intended the distinction to capture different concepts of citizenship, the co-existence of the two terms in the same constitutional provision suggests that "citizen" did not mean "citizen of the state." That inference is confirmed by subsequent constitutional history, which shows that the term "citizen" has long been understood to mean "citizen of the United States." Restrictions on suffrage, including the citizenship requirement, were heavily debated during the Constitutional Convention of 1867. Horace Greeley, "chairman of the 'committee on the right of suffrage and the qualifications to hold office' " proposed an "article on suffrage" that would have "modified in many important respects the existing constitutional provisions on this subject" (2 Lincoln, The Constitutional History of New York at 294-295). Among other modifications, the proposal would have substituted the phrase "citizen of the United States" for "citizen" ( see id. at 295). From the Convention's rejection of that amendment, perhaps animated by a delegate's speech denouncing the amendment as one that would disenfranchise African Americans in New York ( Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of New York Held in 1867 and 1868 , 517-518), intervenors draw the conclusion that "citizen" in our Constitution means "New York state citizen" and not "citizen of the United States." The failure of the proposed amendment cannot be understood to have altered the meaning of the citizenship requirement in our Constitution. Moreover, at the time of the 1867 Convention, the status of U.S. citizenship was unsettled, and there was no reason to take affirmative steps to tether New York's Constitution to it. [FN11] There was no definition of citizenship in the U.S. Constitution; whether citizenship was determined by state or federal law was controversial ( see Dred Scott v Sandford , 60 US 393, 15 L Ed 691 [1857], superseded [1868]); the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which created a statutory right to U.S. citizenship, was in doubt; and the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside," had not been ratified, and was the subject of a fraught ratification process. Just as the New York Constitutional Convention wrapped its work in February 1868, New Jersey and Ohio purported to withdraw their ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was not until July 20, 1868, that the Fourteenth Amendment was conclusively adopted—well after the New York Constitutional Convention had disbanded. Thus, the 1867 Constitutional Convention's rejection of the amendment appending "of the United States" to "citizen" furnishes no support for intervenors' argument. [FN12] We also note that, during the 1894 Constitutional Convention, the delegates debated (and rejected) resolutions identifying 16 other states that allowed voting by certain non-U.S. citizens, "thus permitting persons to participate in the government of this country who are subjects of a foreign power, and who owe allegiance neither to the state nor to the United States, thereby giving rise to occasions when the vote of aliens may change the course of government," and urging Congress to propose a federal constitutional amendment "requiring all voters to be citizens, and prohibiting any state from granting the right of suffrage to any person who is not a citizen of the United States" (3 Lincoln, The Constitutional History of New York at 74-79). The proponents of the resolutions, in urging adoption, made clear "that New York had steadily adhered to the principle of citizen suffrage" that did not allow non-U.S. citizens to vote ( id. at 77). Although neither resolution was adopted (for fear of being perceived as "meddling improperly with the affairs of the Federal Government" or as "a discourteous criticism upon the Constitution of our sister states" [ id . at 76]), the debate was animated by a common understanding that the New York Constitution restricted the franchise to U.S. citizens ( see id. at 74-79). [FN13] Article II, section 1 has been amended several times since 1894, but the citizenship requirement has persisted. There is no evidence that any of the amendments changed the understanding that a voter must be a citizen to vote in New York. V. Nearly 200 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville observed: "When a people begins to touch the electoral qualification, one can foresee that it will sooner or later make it disappear completely. That is one of the most invariable rules that govern societies. As one moves the limit of electoral rights back, one feels the need to move it back more; for after each new concession, the forces of democracy increase and its demands grow with its new power. The ambition of those who are left below the property qualification becomes irritated in proportion to the great number of those who are found above. The exception finally becomes the rule; concessions succeed each other relentlessly and there is no stopping until they have arrived at universal suffrage" (Democracy in America: Vol 1 ch IV, at 55 [Harvey C. Mansfield & Delba Winthrop, trans, U. Chicago 2002] [1831]). Americans have fought over the meaning of citizenship and the right to vote since the earliest days of our Republic. As de Tocqueville predicted, history has moved toward expansion of both, sometimes in broad leaps, as in the Reconstruction and Nineteenth Amendments, and sometimes incrementally—occasionally with a step or two backwards. Whatever the future may bring, the New York Constitution as it stands today draws a firm line restricting voting to citizens. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division insofar as appealed from should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed. "Effective local self-government and intergovernmental cooperation are purposes of the people of the state" (NY Const, art IX, § 1 ["Bill of rights for local governments"]). "The idea that local officials should be chosen by local constituencies is one with deep roots in our democratic polity. . . . [New York's] home rule article and statutes receive their inspiration from the deeply felt belief that local problems should, so long as they do not impinge on affairs of the people of the State as a whole, be solved locally" ( Matter of Resnick v County of Ulster , 44 NY2d 279, 285, 288 [1978] [internal citations omitted]). Article IX of the New York State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law grant localities broad authority to structure their own governments and elections to enhance accountability and serve the unique needs of their residents. The New York City Council relied on that authority to enact Local Law 11, which purports to allow noncitizen lawful permanent residents and people authorized to work in the United States to vote in local elections as "municipal voters." The question on appeal is whether there is any legal impediment to the City Council's action. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that Local Law 11 violates Articles II and IX of the State Constitution. To the contrary, the State Constitution recognizes the primacy of home rule control over this core issue of local autonomy. The majority's holding relies on a reading of Article II, section 1 that ignores its plain text. That provision guarantees that "every citizen shall be entitled to vote" if they meet certain age and residency requirements. It is a declaration of an affirmative right that does not prohibit localities from exercising their home rule authority to enfranchise noncitizens. The drafters of Article II, section 1 would not impose such a drastic limitation on home rule by mere implication, as the majority reads it, but would only have done so expressly. Nor does any other provision of the State Constitution support the majority's convoluted explanations for why we should ignore the actual words in Article II, section 1, and replace them to read that "only citizens" can vote in local elections. The only disenfranchisement provision in the State Constitution is Article II, section 3, which excludes "persons" convicted of certain crimes from the right of suffrage. That section uses the term "persons," rather than "citizens," to ensure that it covers any noncitizens convicted of those crimes whom localities might otherwise enfranchise in local elections. Article II, sections 5 and 7, specify statewide election procedures for citizen voters, without preempting any local laws that permit noncitizens to vote in local elections alongside citizens. In short, Article II works seamlessly with Article IX to allow localities to expand the franchise to noncitizen members of their communities to vote on local matters. Thus, Local Law 11 does not violate the State Constitution. Moreover, the State Election Law imposes no impediment to Local Law 11. While the Election Law permits only United States citizens to register and vote, it expressly allows localities to exercise their home rule authority and supersede this requirement. However, Local Law 11 is not self-effectuating. By its terms, the law requires that the City implement extensive changes to its registration and election procedures to accommodate municipal voters. It goes so far as to define the means that the Board of Elections (BOE) adopts for "municipal voter registration" as a "method." The law therefore constitutes a change in the "method" of electing local public officers within the meaning of Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 (2) (e), which requires approval by local referendum for any [*8]such change. Since no referendum was put to the People of the City of New York, Local Law 11 is null and void, and I would affirm the Appellate Division solely on that ground. [FN14] I. Local Law 11 Enfranchises Noncitizens Lawfully Present in the United States and New York to Vote in Municipal Elections On December 9, 2021, the City Council amended the City Charter with the purpose of "allowing lawful permanent residents in New York City to vote in municipal elections." The amendment, titled Local Law 11, enfranchised a class of noncitizens designated "municipal voters," consisting of any person who: (1) holds lawful permanent residence or is lawfully authorized to work in the United States; (2) has resided in New York City for at least 30 consecutive days leading up to an election; and (3) satisfies "all qualifications for registering or pre-registering to vote under the [E]lection [L]aw, except for possessing United States citizenship, and who has registered or pre-registered to vote with the board of elections in the city of New York under this chapter" (New York City Charter Ch 46-A [hereinafter "ch 46-A"], § 1057-aa). Local Law 11 permits municipal voters to vote in all "municipal elections," relevantly defined as "any general, primary, or run-off election," "any special election" for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and council member, and any municipal referendum ( see id. §§ 1057-aa, 1057-bb). Local Law 11 would vastly expand the franchise in New York City, a locality that is home to approximately 3.1 million immigrants, of whom 27 percent (over 800,000) are lawful permanent residents or hold another form of lawful status. [FN15] It provides a means for this significant part of the City's population to have a voice in their government. II. Plaintiffs, who include certain registered voters, current and former elected officials, and representatives of the Republican Party, sued to declare Local Law 11 unconstitutional and in violation of the Election and Municipal Home Rule Laws. Defendants—the Mayor, City Council, and the BOE—and certain putative municipal voter intervenors [FN16] responded that Local Law 11 is a wholly lawful exercise of home rule [*9]control over local elections. For the reasons I discuss infra , Local Law 11 survives plaintiffs' constitutional challenges, but it fails to comply with Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 (2) (e). A. Standard of Review "It is well settled that facial constitutional challenges are disfavored. Legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality . . . [and] parties challenging a duly enacted statute face the initial burden of demonstrating the statute's invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt" ( Overstock.com, Inc. v New York State Dept. of Taxation & Fin. , 20 NY3d 586, 593 [2013], quoting LaValle v Hayden , 98 NY2d 155, 161 [2002] [internal quotation marks omitted]). "It has been our repeated admonition . . . that 'legislation should not be declared unconstitutional unless it clearly appears to be so' and that 'all doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of an act' " ( White v Cuomo , 38 NY3d 209, 228-229 [2022], quoting Johnson v City of New York , 274 NY 411, 430 [1937]). We may only hold that a law is unconstitutional "after 'every reasonable mode of reconciliation of the statute with the Constitution has been resorted to, and reconciliation has been found impossible' " ( id. at 216, quoting Matter of Fay , 291 NY 198, 207 [1943]). The strong presumption of constitutionality applies to local laws just as it does to state laws ( see Johnson , 274 NY at 430 [a provision of the New York City Charter did not violate the State Constitution, as "all doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of an act" and "the wisdom of legislation is not for us to determine"]; 41 Kew Gardens Road Associates v Tyburski , 70 NY3d 325, 333 [1987] ["(A) duly enacted local law is clothed with the presumption of constitutionality that applies to State legislative enactments"] [internal citations omitted]). Moreover, "the Legislature . . . has empowered municipalities to legislate in a wide range of matters relating to local concern. So long as local legislation is not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general law, localities may adopt local laws . . . except 'to the extent that the legislature shall restrict the adoption of such a local law' " ( Albany Area Builders Assn. v Town of Guilderland , 74 NY2d 374, 378 [1989] [internal citations omitted]). Plaintiffs have not met their heavy burden. The State Constitution and State law do not prohibit a locality from enfranchising noncitizens in elections for local public officers and on municipal issues. To the contrary, the Constitution specifically authorizes municipal self-governance, and so the City could exercise this power to enact Local Law 11—but only by referendum. B. Article IX and State Law Establish the Primacy of Home Rule Home rule has long existed in New York State and is the basis for local control over the structures of local government. "The theory behind home rule is very simple: it is the thought that local problems, in which the State has no concern, can best be handled locally" ( Baldwin v City of Buffalo , 6 NY2d 168, 172 [1959]). The constitutional home rule provision set forth in Article IX, Section 1 (a), titled the "Bill of Rights for Local Governments," declares that "[e]ffective local self-government and intergovernmental cooperation are purposes of the people of the state." To achieve those purposes and affirm the primacy of home rule, Article IX declares that "in addition to those granted by other provisions of this constitution," "[e]very local government shall have power to adopt local laws as provided by this article" and "[a]ll officers of every local government whose election or appointment is not provided for by this constitution shall be elected by the people of the local government, or some division thereof, or appointed by such officers of the local [*10]government as may be provided by law" (NY Const, art IX, §§ 1 [a], 1 [b]). Thus, the "people" of a locality may vote for its local officers. Article IX further commands that the "[r]ights, powers, privileges and immunities granted to local governments by this article shall be liberally construed" (NY Const, art IX, § 3 [c]). Home rule authority must therefore be given the most expansive reading permissible. Accordingly, limitations on self-governance must be express and not implied, because only a clear restraint on municipal control over local issues comports with this constitutionally mandated rule of broad construction. Article IX, section 3 (d) provides that "the following terms shall mean or include: "(1) 'General law.' A law which in terms and in effect applies alike to all counties, all counties other than those wholly included within a city, all cities, all towns or all villages. (2) 'Local government.' A county, city, town or village. (3) 'People.' Persons entitled to vote as provided in section one of article two of this constitution. (4) 'Special law.' A law which in terms and in effect applies to one or more, but not all, counties, counties other than those wholly included within a city, cities, towns or villages" (NY Const, art IX, § 3 [d]). Section 3's definitions section is written in the disjunctive—the terms listed therein "shall mean or include" the definition that follows. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, "[t]he terms 'means' and 'includes' are not necessarily synonymous . . . The natural distinction would be that where 'means' is employed, the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and that the verb 'includes' imports a general class, some of whose particular instances are specified in the definition" ( Helvering v Morgan's Inc. , 293 US 121, 125 n 1 [1934]). Accordingly, the terms "mean" and "include" must each apply to different definitions in section 3 (d). The term "include" must apply to the definition of "people," allowing localities to extend the franchise to local elections beyond the citizens whom Article II, section 1, grants an affirmative right to vote. Article IX, section 1 (a) declares among the "rights, powers, privileges and immunities" provided to localities that "[e]very local government . . . shall have a legislative body elected by the people," and section 1 (b) requires that "[a]ll officers of every local government whose election or appointment is not provided for by this constitution shall be elected by the people of the local government." Reading these provisions liberally, as we must under section 3 (c), the term "people" must be read to "include" the citizens whom Article II, section 1 entitles to vote, as part of a larger class of people whom localities may permit to vote in local elections if they conclude that doing so is the best way to promote local accountability and strengthen local governance. [FN17] The majority asserts that "means or includes," as applied to "people" in Article IX, section 3 (d) must be read as limiting "people" to the citizens entitled to vote by Article II, section 1 ( see majority op at 15). The majority's analysis is deeply flawed. First, the majority cites to statutes that use the conjunctive—"means and includes"—to claim that in such statutes, the phrase is a "term of art to indicate that a definition is comprehensive, not that 'includes' should allow for the expansion beyond the defined terms" ( id. at 16). Of course, these statutes fail to illuminate the meaning of section 3 (d)'s disjunctive "means or includes," which is a different phrase raising different implications. [FN18] Second, the majority violates the rule of construction that we interpret language to give meaning to every word and avoid interpretations that render any word superfluous ( see Mestecky v City of New York , 30 NY3d 239, 243 [2017]). The majority simply ignores that the word "includes" complements the word "means" and gives full meaning to certain terms defined in section 3 to maximize home rule authority. [FN19] Although the majority asserts that "there is no basis to choose whether to apply 'mean' or 'include' to each defined term" (majority op at 15-16), the proper reading of Article IX gives meaning to every word and considers each provision together, applies our routine tools of construction to determine without issue that "include" applies to "people." Third, and most troubling, the majority's narrow reading of section 3 (d) disregards Article IX's command that we liberally construe home rule authority. Local control over local elections by local people is essential for "[e]ffective local self-government" (NY Const, art IX, § 1). Effective local self-government necessarily includes the right of local communities to choose who may vote for local public officials and local laws, and how best to ensure accountability of their elected representatives. The majority's approach erodes home rule in contravention of our State's commitment to local control. Just as Article IX authorizes localities to structure their government to address local needs unless explicitly proscribed by the constitutional text, the Municipal Home Rule Law also provides for the primacy of local control, absent a superseding constitutional or state law provision ( see Municipal Home Rule Law § 10 [1] [i]). The Municipal Home Rule Law states, "every local government [] shall have power to adopt and amend local laws not inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution or not inconsistent with any general law, relating to" the "mode of selection . . . of its officers and employees" ( id. § 10 [1] [ii] [a] [i]). As these provisions make clear, the People of the State of New York have chosen home rule primacy by empowering localities to order their affairs as they see fit based on their local interests and needs. To achieve that purpose, Article IX and the Home Rule Law must be read to maximize local control over local [*11]government unless inconsistent with an express constitutional or statutory limitation. As I discuss infra , neither the State Constitution nor the Election Law explicitly limit a locality's power to enfranchise noncitizens, lawfully present in New York, to vote in wholly local elections. C. Local Law 11 Is Consistent with Article II of the State Constitution Article II, titled "Suffrage," sets forth constitutional requirements for voting. [FN20] Section 1, states, "Every citizen shall be entitled to vote at every election for all officers elected by the people and upon all questions submitted to the vote of the people, provided that such citizen is eighteen years of age or over and shall have been a resident of this state, and of the county, city, or village for thirty days next preceding an election" (NY Const, art 2, § 1). By its plain terms, this provision enfranchises citizens who satisfy its age and residency requirements. The phrase "every citizen shall be entitled to vote" is an affirmative grant of the right to vote to citizens. It does not limit a locality's authority to expand the franchise to noncitizens. If such a restriction were intended, section 1 would simply use the unambiguous and clear words of limitation that "only citizens shall be entitled to vote." Article II, section 1 does not contain these words of limitation, and we may not add words to the State Constitution to manufacture a limitation that does not exist ( cf. People v Finnegan , 85 NY2d 53, 58 [1995] ["We have firmly held that the failure of the Legislature to include a substantive, significant prescription in a statute is a strong indication that its exclusion was intended"]; Theroux v Reilly , 1 NY3d 232, 240 [2003] ["If the Legislature had intended to restrict" a statute's applicability, "it easily could have and surely would have written the statute to say so. We may not create a limitation that the Legislature did not enact"]). Nevertheless, the majority asserts that Article II, section 1 requires that "only citizens may vote in elections within the State of New York" (majority op at 5). The majority's conclusion relies on unsupported reasoning that because citizens are enfranchised by section 1, everyone else is disenfranchised. That atextual interpretation makes little sense on its own terms. As I have explained, if the legislature intended Article II, section 1 to exclude those not mentioned, it would have said so expressly and not left such a significant matter to judicial inference ( see Finnegan , 85 NY2d at 58). The majority's reading of Article II, section 1 is also contrary to the history of this provision. Since it was first enacted in 1821, section 1 has only been amended to expand, not limit, the franchise to ensure that localities cannot impose restrictions on certain voters. Article II, section 1 initially guaranteed the right to vote only to white male citizens who were at least 21 years old, resided in New York State for one year prior to an election and in a particular county or town for six months, and met a property tax or public service [*12]requirement; and to Black male citizens who resided in New York State for at least three years and fulfilled a property requirement ( see 1821 NY Const, art II, § 1). Just five years after its enactment, Article II, section 1 was amended to remove some of "[t]he qualifications of being a taxpayer or of rendering public service," although it retained a property requirement for Black men ( Johnson , 274 NY at 418; 1846 NY Const, art II, § 1). By the 1938 Constitutional Convention, Article II, section 1 guaranteed the right to vote to "[e]very citizen of the age of twenty-one years, who shall have been a citizen for ninety days, and an inhabitant of [New York] for one year next preceding an election, and for the last four months a resident of the county and for the last thirty days a resident of the election district in which [they] may offer [their] vote" (1938 NY Const, art II, § 1). Since then, the minimum age and residency requirements have been lowered to expand the guaranteed right to vote ( see NY Const, art II, § 1). This expanded constitutional guarantee of the right to vote has never come with a concomitant restriction on a locality's authority to extend the franchise to those who have been left out. Other sections of Article II confirm that section 1 ensures suffrage for citizens while allowing localities to enfranchise noncitizens in local elections. Section 3 states, "No person who shall receive, accept, offer to receive, or pay, offer or promise to pay, contribute, offer or promise to contribute to another, to be paid or used, any money or other valuable thing as a compensation or reward for the giving or withholding a vote at an election . . . . The legislature shall enact laws excluding from the right of suffrage all persons convicted of bribery or of any infamous crime" (NY Const, art 2, § 3). The use of "persons" rather than "citizen" would be unnecessary unless someone other than a citizen could be enfranchised by a local law pursuant to Article IX. By excluding "persons," section 3 ensures that noncitizens—if entitled to vote under local law—comply with the State Constitution's antibribery mandate or else risk disenfranchisement. The provision would also preempt any local law that empowered noncitizens to vote, even if they were previously convicted of a disqualifying crime. The majority's explanation that Article II, section 3 uses the word "persons" solely to encompass people who were convicted of bribery or any other disenfranchising crime before they became naturalized citizens is unpersuasive ( see majority op at 12 n 8). The phrase "all citizens convicted of bribery or of any infamous crime" would plainly include such circumstances, and even if there were any doubt, the framers could have written, "all citizens ever convicted of bribery or of any infamous crime." Instead, the framers used a different term entirely, "persons," to "expand[] the provision as broadly as possible" ( id. ) and include noncitizens whom localities may enfranchise to vote in local elections. Additionally, the recognized authority of localities to extend the franchise in local elections also explains the use of the term "citizen" in Article II, section 5. That section states, "Laws shall be made for ascertaining, by proper proofs, the citizens who shall be entitled to the right of suffrage hereby established, and for the registration of voters; which registration shall be completed at least ten days before each election. Such registration shall not be required for town and village elections except by express provision of law" (NY Const, art 2, § 5). This provision requires the legislature to enact a mechanism for citizens to exercise their guaranteed right to vote under section 1, by proving their citizenship. If they establish citizenship "by proper proofs" and fulfill the age and residency requirements, a locality cannot infringe on their right to vote. The laws that section 5 require therefore ensure an orderly process for those whom section 1 "entitled . . . the right of suffrage" to vote without interference by localities and, in doing so, necessarily singles out citizens. In contrast, section 5 requires laws for the uniform registration of "voters"—not just citizens—reflecting a recognition that localities may expand the franchise and that citizen and noncitizen voters alike must register before voting, [*13]except for expressly excluded town and village elections. Local Law 11 conforms with the mandates of section 5 by requiring municipal voters to fulfill the same registration requirements that apply to citizen voters. Article II, section 7, similarly does not support the majority's reading of section 1 as prohibiting a locality from enfranchising its noncitizen residents. Section 7 states, in relevant part, "[a]ll elections by the citizens, except for such town officers as may by law be directed to be otherwise chosen, shall be by ballot, or by such other method as may be prescribed by law, provided that secrecy in voting be preserved." This provision protects voting by secret ballot. If a locality exercises its home rule authority to enfranchise noncitizens to vote in local elections alongside citizens—in other words, if it allows citizens and noncitizens to vote—section 7 will apply. There is no such thing as a pure "election by noncitizens" that falls completely outside the ambit of section 7 and would not require voting by secret ballot, because an election that excluded citizens would violate Article II, section 1. [FN21] In sum, Local Law 11 is consistent with Article II, section 1, which guarantees the right to vote to citizens who fulfill the residency requirement. It does no more than that, as confirmed by its plain language and the language of other sections of Article II, as well as its history of extending its guarantee without ever imposing an express restriction on the right to vote. The majority's dubious reading of Article II results from its mischaracterization of the issue as whether the State Constitution "guarantee[s] the right of suffrage to persons other than citizens" (majority op at 6). No provision of the State Constitution guarantees that right, but nor does any provision prevent a locality from using its home rule authority allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. D. Our Precedent Recognizes the Constitutional Primacy of Home Rule For more than a century, and before Article IX enshrined home rule in the State Constitution, we have strongly affirmed the authority to structure local elections as a locality sees fit. In Spitzer v Village of Fulton , plaintiffs deposited money with the Village of Fulton to secure the village's performance of a contract to purchase bonds (172 NY 285, 287 [1902]). The village intended to use the money it received from selling bonds to construct "a system of water works within its boundaries for the use of the [village] and its inhabitants" ( id. ). Under local law, only residents who owned (or whose spouses owned) property in the village were allowed to vote on the local proposition authorizing the bonds ( id. ). Although the village awarded the plaintiffs the bonds for which they deposited money, the plaintiffs refused to accept them and expressed their intent to rescind the contract ( id. ). After the village refused to return the plaintiffs' deposits, the plaintiffs sued ( id. ). They alleged that the state statute authorizing the local proposition violated Article II, section 1, which, at the time, guaranteed the right to vote to "[e]very male citizen of the age of twenty-one years" who met residency requirements, regardless of property ownership ( id. ). The Spitzer Court concluded that the local law did not conflict with Article II, section 1, and confirmed that home rule controlled over the "financial interests and private affairs" of localities. It explained, "The obvious purpose [of Article II, section 1] was to prescribe the general qualifications that voters throughout the state were required to possess to authorize them to vote for public officers or upon public questions related to [*14]general governmental affairs. But we are of the opinion that the article was not intended to define the qualifications of voters upon questions relating to the financial interests or private affairs of the various cities or incorporated villages of the state, especially when, as in this case, it relates to borrowing money or contracting debts" (172 NY at 289). Thus, long before the 1963 adoption of Article IX, the Court recognized in Spitzer that localities have autonomy outside of the "general governmental affairs" of the State and that localities may control local elections concerning their "private affairs" ( id. at 289-290). Spitzer 's holding that Article II, section 1 does not apply to purely local concerns is not limited to taxation or local finances. The language in Spitzer is sweeping and allows for no such cabining of home rule [FN22] . Indeed, New York courts have consistently understood that local control of its "private affairs" extends to all manner of concerns, beyond a locality's finances ( see e.g. , Matter of Esler v Walters , 56 NY2d 306, 314 [1982] ["Limiting voter eligibility in water district elections to landowning residents does not violate those sections of the State Constitution specifically dealing with voter rights"]; Matter of Schulz v Horseheads Cent. School Dist. Bd. of Educ. , 222 AD2d 819, 820 [3d Dept 1995] [holding that Article II, section 1 does not apply to local school district elections]; Turco v Union Free School Dist. No. 4 , 43 Misc 2d 367 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1964] [same]; In re Carrick , 183 AD 916, 916 [4th Dept 1918], affd 223 NY 621 [1918] [Article II, section 1 does not apply to "submitting the local option questions relating to the trafficking in liquor in cities"]). [FN23] In Bareham v City of Rochester , a taxpayer residing in Rochester challenged the constitutionality of a local law that superseded various provisions of the city charter, including by modifying the structure of the city government from mayor-council to council-manager (246 NY 140, 144 [1927]). Although Bareham did not involve a challenge under Article II, section 1, the Court affirmed the quintessentially local nature of electing local officers, such as a mayor, and the authority localities possess to restructure their election processes ( see id. at 149 ["The municipality is empowered to modify an election law in so far as that law affects the property, government or affairs of the municipality, i.e. , in so far as it affects the election of local officers"]). Thus, Bareham is relevant to our analysis of Article II, section 1, because it is proof of our longstanding recognition that the election of local officers is a private affair. The Court revisited Article II, section 1, in Johnson (274 NY 411). Johnson concerned a challenge to a New York City Charter provision implementing a system of proportional representation in city council elections (274 NY at 416-417). The provision limited voting to a single candidate out of a group running for city council at the borough level ( id. ). The Court, tasked with deciding whether the provision violated the Constitution, reviewed the history of Article II, section 1, which, when first enacted in 1821, "reluctantly let [*15]go of . . . property qualification[s]" that previously limited suffrage to landowners ( id. at 417). In 1826, Article II, section 1 was amended by "removing completely all disqualification of voters," including limits based on taxpayer status or "rendering public service" ( id. ). The Court concluded, "[n]o one can read the history of these changes in the early Constitution without realizing that the object of the change in the law made by these two Constitutions was to remove the disqualifications which attached to the person of the voter" ( id. at 418). The Johnson Court quoted large portions of Spitzer 's legal analysis, including its reference to "financial interests or private affairs" (274 NY at 418). It also surveyed the history of "[m]inority representation by voting" in New York, concluding, "[w]e can hardly imagine that [A]rticle II, section 1 of the Constitution forbade the election of aldermen of the City of New York under a minority representative system, and that the people for all these years slept upon their rights" ( see id. at 421-423). Moreover, the Court rejected the contention that a prior case, Matter of Hopper v Britt (203 NY 144 [1911]), stood for the proposition that the City's experiment with city council elections was improper ( id. at 423). The Court determined that Hopper was distinguishable because it involved "a limitation placed upon one voter which did not apply to another voter in the same district" ( id. ). [FN24] In contrast, the charter provision at issue in Johnson "treats all electors alike, and does not prevent a [person] from voting for the candidate of [their] choice" ( id. ). Thus, Article II, section 1 was not an impediment to the City's decision to modify its electoral process ( see id. ). Several decades later, the Court addressed Article II, section 1, again in Matter of Blaikie v Power (13 NY2d 134 [1964]). Blaikie involved a challenge to a New York City charter provision that permitted the election of councilmembers at large, and implemented a form of "limited voting" wherein voters could select only one of two candidates on the ballot (13 NY2d at 138). A plurality considered the issue to be a straightforward application of Johnson ( id. at 140), and it cited Johnson 's review of the history of Article II, section 1 expanding suffrage, and Johnson 's explanation of why Hopper was distinguishable ( id. at 141). The plurality wrote that "[i]n the context of [Article II, section 1], limited voting and proportional representation are in substance and effect identical. . . . [E]ach system necessarily involves a limitation of voting, imposed on all voters alike, in order to make possible of achievement some minority representation in a multiple body" ( id. at 143-144). Thus, the charter provision did not violate Article II, section 1 ( see id. ). One Judge concurred, writing that even if Article II, section 1 prohibited limited voting, it would not affect the charter provision, "because the constitutional provision is limited in its application to elections involving state officers or state issues," citing Spitzer ( id. at 144 [Burke, J., concurring]). Johnson and Blaikie both support that Article II, section 1 merely sets a constitutional floor that guarantees the right to vote to citizens. In each case, the Court recognized a locality's authority to structure its own elections as it desires, so long as it treats voters equally and does not take away a citizen's right to vote for their preferred candidate. Local Law 11 does not thwart a citizen's right to vote or otherwise disenfranchise eligible voters. Quite the opposite. Local Law 11 expands the franchise for a population of New York City so that they may vote in local elections involving the City's "private affairs" and governance structure. The majority relies on People ex rel. Smith v Pease (27 NY 45 [1863]) and Hopper (203 NY 144) to support its atextual reading, but both cases pre-date Article IX and our State's commitment by constitutional provision and statute to the primacy of home rule in local government matters, unless preempted by the State Constitution or state law. An analysis dependent on caselaw superseded by constitutional amendment is no analysis at all. Even setting that dispositive point aside, neither case involved a local or state law that expanded the franchise beyond Article II, section 1's constitutional floor. Thus, in Pease , which involved a dispute over the propriety of votes cast for treasurer in a county-wide election, the Court correctly observed [*16]that "none others than those possessing the[] qualifications" from Article II, section 1, could vote (27 NY at 53). There was no additional state or local law at issue that expanded the franchise, and no occasion for the Court to speculate on the propriety of such a law. Similarly, Hopper involved a challenge to the format of election ballots (203 NY at 149). The Court cited Article II, section 1 to explain that the Constitution guarantees the right to vote to those who are "qualified," and that "any system of election that unnecessarily prevents the elector from voting or from voting for the candidate of [their] choice violates the Constitution" ( id. at 150). Such was the case in Hopper , where the ballot format improperly listed candidates nominated by more than one party in a way that unnecessarily prevented some voters from voting for the candidate of their choice ( id. at 150). In full context, Hopper 's reference to the qualifications in Article II, section 1 as "exclusive" was merely clarifying that if a voter possessed those qualifications, no law could impose an additional qualification or otherwise prevent them from voting. III. The Majority's Remaining Arguments The majority's other arguments are similarly unpersuasive and border on the fantastic and implausible. The majority contends that if localities can enfranchise noncitizens, then Article II, sections 5 and 7, would not prevent localities from adopting criteria of their choosing as applied to noncitizens. That is exactly what home rule provides: localities may experiment with various forms of local government structure, including election criteria, because localities know best how to address local matters ( see Johnson , 274 NY at 430 ["If the people of the city of New York want to try the system (of proportional representation), make the experiment, and have voted to do so, we as a court should be very slow in determining that the act is unconstitutional, until we can put our finger upon the very provisions of the Constitution which prohibit it."]; Resnick , 44 NY2d at 286 ["(E)ven in the era when a very narrow interpretation was given to (New York's) home rule provisions, municipalities were accorded great autonomy in experimenting with the manner in which their local officers . . . were to be chosen"]). This is a hallmark of our State democratic governance structure, not a weakness as the majority implies. Localities may experiment with their form of local elections as long as they do not run afoul of the State Constitution or state law. Moreover, as explained in Section II, supra , Article II, sections 5 and 7, when properly read are consistent with noncitizens voting in local elections. By way of example of what the majority considers the horrors of local enfranchisement laws, it points to the defendants' and intervenors' concession at oral argument in response to a hypothetical that a locality could allow a 13-year-old to vote. Putting aside that Local Law 11 does not enfranchise children, but instead requires municipal voters to be 18 years of age, that the Council would enfranchise a 13-year-old is as unlikely as it is impossible. Minors lack many rights guaranteed to adults, and state law in many areas cedes a minor's decision-making authority to their parents or lawful guardians or significantly interferes in that decision-making authority. [FN25] Even if there were a remotely realistic possibility that localities would consider enfranchising their 13-year population, the State legislature can simply amend the Election Law to prohibit the locality from doing so, just as it may for any aspect of a local law that it considers at odds with statewide [*17]values or concerns. The Election Law already limits voting to 18-year-olds ( see Election Law § 5-102). The legislature has not affirmatively prevented localities from superseding that limit, presumably because it does not believe that any locality would do so ( see Section IV, infra ). [FN26] The majority additionally claims that the contrasting use of the phrase "citizen of the United States" in the New York Constitution, particularly in Article III, section 7, as well as evidence that delegates to the 1867 Constitutional Convention rejected an amendment to Article II, section 2 to make direct reference to federal citizenship, do not support the argument that the term "citizen," as used in Article II, section 2, refers to a state citizenship that is broader than federal citizenship and would encompass the municipal voters whom Local Law 11 sought to enfranchise ( see majority op at 17-22). The majority reasons that when the framers drafted Article II, section 1, and when the delegates rejected the amendment at the 1867 Constitutional Convention, "the status of U.S. citizenship was unsettled, and there was no reason to take affirmative steps to tether New York's Constitution to it" ( id. at 20). The majority observes that Article III, section 7, was adopted after the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarified U.S. citizenship ( id. at 21 n 12). As the majority readily admits, this argument "is disconnected from the issue in this case" ( id. at 17), because the City Council intended to enfranchise people whom they understood were not citizens within the meaning of Article II, section 1, whether the term "citizen" refers to federal or state citizenship. Regardless, the majority's historical discussion fails to account for the fact that the State Constitution referenced federal citizenship long before the Fourteenth Amendment. During the same Constitutional Convention in 1821 in which Article II, section 1 was first enacted, the framers simultaneously enacted Article III, section 2, which limited eligibility for governor to a "native citizen of the United States." [FN27] IV. Local Law 11 Does Not Violate the Election Law Although Election Law § 5-102 sets a default rule that only citizens may vote in local elections, it does not prohibit localities from superseding that rule by enfranchising noncitizens through home rule authority. The Election Law governs all elections in New York (Election Law § 1-102). But it acknowledges the general primacy of home rule control over local elections, allowing local laws to govern unless it expressly preempts them. To that end, Election Law § 1-102 states that "[w]here a specific provision of law exists in any other law which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such provision shall apply [*18]unless a provision of this chapter specifies that such provision of this chapter shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law." In turn, Election Law § 5-102 (1) states that, "No person shall be qualified to register for and vote at any election unless [they are] a citizen of the United States and [are] or will be, on the day of such election, eighteen years of age or over, and a resident of this state and of the county, city or village for a minimum of thirty days next preceding such election" (Election Law § 5-102 [1]). Section 5-102 does not require application "notwithstanding any other provision of law." The phrase "any other law" clearly encompasses local laws such as Local Law 11, and there is no persuasive reason to depart from that plain meaning ( see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist. , 91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998] ["As the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text, the starting point in any case of interpretation must be the language itself, giving effect to the plain meaning thereof"]). Thus, the Election Law does not impose a statutory impediment to the City Council exercising its home rule authority to enact Local Law 11. V. Local Law 11 Could Only Have Been Lawfully Adopted by Referendum Under Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 (2) (e), "a local law shall be subject to mandatory referendum if it," relevantly, "changes the method of nominating, electing or removing an elective officer." As the City Council recognized, Local Law 11 can only be implemented by modification of various existing procedures for nominating and electing public officers. Accordingly, Local Law 11 imposes various comprehensive procedural requirements to ensure that the City's sizable population of eligible municipal voters has access to the ballot. The BOE must "adopt all necessary rules and carry out all necessary staff training to carry out the provisions of" Local Law 11 (Ch 46-A, § 1057-cc). The BOE must also "produce a poll ledger or computer generated registration list that combines municipal voters and other U.S. citizen voters for each election district or poll site" ( id. § 1057-dd [a]). If a municipal election coincides with any other election, the BOE "shall produce separate municipal ballots to be distributed only to municipal voters" ( id. § 1057-dd [b]). It also requires the BOE to "design and distribute a municipal voter registration form that will allow municipal voters to apply for registration, pre-registration, and change of enrollment" (Ch 46-A, § 1057-ee [a]). To maximize accessibility, the BOE must "translate the municipal voter registration application form into languages served by [the BOE] pursuant to state and federal law in a manner that is consistent with translations of the statewide application form" ( id. § 1057-gg [b]). Municipal voters shall be permitted to submit a "municipal voter absentee ballot application form," and BOE must generate "separate municipal absentee ballots" when a municipal election and any other election fall on the same date ( id. §§ 1057-hh [a], [d]). The BOE and the campaign finance board "shall coordinate efforts to ensure that municipal voter registration application forms are available at every location where New York state board of elections voter registration forms are made available" ( id. § 1057-gg [a]). The BOE must also "create and implement a notification system for municipal voters" ( id. § 1057-jj). Local Law 11 also requires that the BOE and the campaign finance board "consult regularly with appropriate organizations, including advocacy groups and community associations, in the implementation of [the law]" (Ch 46-A, § 1057-oo). Moreover, "[t]here shall be an advisory group to provide recommendations [*19]regarding any problems or potential improvements with respect to municipal voting" ( id. § 1057-tt [a]). The advisory group, which consists of five members, including the current public advocate, must annually "prepare a report of its findings and recommendations with respect to the voting process carried out under this chapter and submit such report to the mayor and speaker of the council" ( id. § 1057-tt [g]). Indeed, Local Law 11 specifically refers to the BOE's implementation of the means by which it "registers or pre-registers new municipal voters" as "the method" for such registration ( id. § 1057-aa [a]). We have long "made clear that local governments have broad power to enact laws, and direct democracy in New York is the exception, not the rule" ( Molinari v Bloomberg , 564 F3d 587, 609 [2d Cir 2009], citing McCabe v Voorhis , 243 NY 401, 413 [1926]). However, Local Law 11 requires the BOE to restructure the way it recognizes a numerous new population of voter and counts their vote in ways that implicate Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 (2) (e)'s referendum mandate. More than "extend[ing] existing methods of voting to an expanded electorate" (majority op at 3 n 1), Local Law 11 requires the BOE to create ballots listing a different combination of elections for different voters based on their citizenship status, produce a poll ledger or new registration lists, create an entirely new registration form, develop a notification system to reach municipal voters, hold trainings, consult with community organizations, and implement new rules necessary to fulfill the law's broad mandate. These varied factors, considered together, show that Local Law 11 changes the method of electing local officers, as the City Council acknowledges in the text of the law itself ( see Ch 46-A, § 1057-aa [a]). While the City of New York can exercise its home rule authority to enfranchise noncitizen "municipal voters," as provided by Local Law 11, the People of the City of New York must adopt this method of nominating and electing its public officers by referendum (Municipal Home Rule Law § 23 [2] [e]). No referendum has been held, and therefore Local Law 11 is null and void. VI. Conclusion This appeal is not about whether enfranchising noncitizens to vote in municipal elections is good policy. That is a political question expressly reserved for local legislative bodies. This appeal is instead about the "private affairs" of New York's local governments. Until the majority's decision here, this Court had uniformly recognized the primacy of home rule. To that end, restrictions on local control can only be achieved by express constitutional or state statutory limitations on the exercise of local authority over local elections, and not by implication. There is no such express prohibition on local enfranchisement of noncitizens. To reach its conclusion that Local Law 11 is unconstitutional, the majority rewrites Article II, section 1, rejecting its plain text. The majority's approach also ignores Article IX's mandate that local government "[r]ights, powers, privileges and immunities" "shall be liberally construed." In so doing, the majority diminishes the power of localities statewide. Control over how a local official is elected and a local referendum is approved is a core concern of localities. Usually, local officers can exercise that control on their own, but sometimes, the people of a locality must make the choice themselves. This is one of those times. Order insofar as appealed from modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed. Opinion by Chief Judge Wilson. Judges Garcia, Singas, Cannataro, Troutman and Halligan concur. Judge Rivera dissents in an opinion. Decided March 20, 2025 Footnotes Footnote 2: Our dissenting colleague offers two responses: a locality would never enfranchise thirteen-year-olds, and if it did, the State legislature can simply amend the Election Law to prohibit the locality from doing so (dissenting op at 25-26). However, the question is not what a locality might do, but what the Constitution allows it to do, and the authority granted to localities under the interpretation proffered by appellants and the dissent is unbounded. Footnote 3: The exception now in Article II, section 7, allowing for the avoidance of election by ballot for "such town officers as may by law be directed to be otherwise chosen," permits town officers to be elected by a method other than by ballot, such as "the old town meeting fashion of calling for the ayes and noes, or by a show of hands or other division" ( People ex rel. Clancy v Board of Supervisors of Westchester County , 139 NY 524 [1893] [discussing 1846 NY Const art II, § 5]). That exception thus does not relate to the meaning of the word "citizen" in Article II, section 1. Footnote 4: The election at issue in Pease was a county election, which disposes of any argument that Article II does not apply to local elections. Footnote 5: Appellants' construction also does not sit well with Article III, which repeatedly uses the words "inhabitants" and "aliens" when instructing how legislative districts are to be apportioned ( see NY Const, art III, §§ 4 (a), (c) (2); 5; 5-a), but simultaneously restricts the right to sue to challenge those apportionments to "citizen[s]" ( id . at § 5). Footnote 6: Matter of Esler v Walters , relied on by the dissent ( see dissenting op at 18) involves a contraction of the right to vote—disenfranchising nonlandholders, not enfranchising noncitizens—on a local ballot resolution to consolidate two water districts (56 NY2d 306, 312 [1982]). Even in that limited circumstance, we emphasized, citing Spitzer , that Article II, section 1 "does not preclude the Legislature from imposing such a requirement in water district elections" specifically ( id. at 314). We also noted that the water district "does not exercise general governmental authority or provide general public services such as housing, transportation, schools or fire and police protection" ( id . at 312). That holding has nothing to do with this case. Footnote 7: Matter of Resnick v County of Ulster , on which appellants rely, is not germane to the issue here. It upheld the constitutionality of a local law providing that a vacancy in a local elective position could be filled by the remaining members of the legislative body, instead of by the Governor, because Article IX, section 2 allowed local governments to provide for appointment of local officers ( see 44 NY2d 279, 285 [1978]). Bareham v City of Rochester (246 NY 140 [1927]), also relied on by appellants, does not concern Article II at all. Footnote 8: The dissent contends that Article II, section 3's use of "persons" rather than "citizens" "would be unnecessary unless someone other than a citizen could be enfranchised by a local law pursuant to Article IX (dissenting op at 15). However, persons who are not citizens are fully capable of paying bribes—or committing any other of the disenfranchising actions listed in section 3. Had section 3 used "citizen" instead of "person" as the dissent suggests, "citizens convicted of bribery" could be read to permit the enfranchisement of persons who had paid or offered to pay a bribe before they became citizens. The use of "persons" expands the provision as broadly as possible, where "citizen" would fail to do so. Footnote 9: The dissent places great weight on the difference between "or" and "and," though in this context, "mean or include" is better read to indicate an equivalence and reference to the term of art. We have repeatedly recognized that "[t]he word 'or' in the phrase quoted may be read as 'and' to carry out the legislative intent" ( Dept. of Welfare of City of N.Y. v Siebel , 6 NY2d 536, 545 [1959]; see also Hale v Sweet , 40 NY 97, 100 [1869]). Footnote 10: Article II, section 1 of the 1821 Constitution distinguished between "citizen[s]" and "citizen[s] of this state" in recognition of the fact that New York had not as of that date entirely abolished slavery and it imposed additional durational and other requirements on free people of color ( see 1821 NY Const, art II, § 1 ["Every male citizen of the age of twenty-one years, who shall have been an inhabitant of this state one year . . . shall be entitled to vote . . . but no man of colour, unless he shall have been for three years a citizen of this state [and meets certain other requirements]. . . shall be entitled to vote"] [emphasis added]). Footnote 11: In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, as it was drafting the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Congress invited a former U.S. representative and prominent lawyer, Horace Binney, as an expert on the meaning of "citizenship" in American constitutional law. He observed, "The word citizen is found ten times at least in the Constitution of the United States, and no definition of it is given anywhere" (quoted in Eric Foner, The Second Founding at 3 [2019]). Although the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship, citizenship did not then convey voting rights—that grant had to await ratification of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. Footnote 12: Additionally, appellants' argument accounts for neither the timing nor context of the different usages in our Constitution. For example, intervenors contrast Article II, section 1's use of "citizen" with Article III, section 7's use of "Citizen of the United States" to infer some important difference in meaning, without acknowledging that the former entered our Constitution long before the Fourteenth Amendment provided that all citizens of the United States were also citizens of the state in which they reside, and the latter entered long after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Footnote 13: The resolution's opponents did not assert otherwise; instead, they "thought that it was outside the province of the Convention to suggest an amendment to the Federal Constitution which would have the effect to change the status of foreign born persons in sister states," and "that it was improper for New York to criticize the Constitutions of other states in this respect" ( id. at 77). Footnote 14: Under other circumstances, I might limit my discussion to what I conclude is the sole ground to nullify Local Law 11, but several reasons make it necessary to address the other challenges plaintiffs raised below. First, the Municipal Home Rule Law presupposes the lawful exercise of home rule authority. Stated differently, only a proposal consistent with the State Constitution and State law may be put to the people by referendum. Second, because the majority resolves this appeal based on its erroneous interpretation of both Article II, section 1 and Article IX, and its reasoning has statewide implications for how localities may exercise their home rule authority in the future, I think it prudent to explain why I disagree with the majority's constitutional analysis. Third, although plaintiffs did not cross-appeal the Appellate Division's rejection of their Election Law claim, my explanation that the Election Law may only preempt a local election law by explicit language supports my broader point that only a clear, direct restraint can limit home rule authority. Footnote 15: See NYC Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs, 2023 Annual Report on New York City's Immigrant Population and Initiatives of the Office , https://www.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/MOIA-Annual-Report-2023_Final.pdf [accessed February 21, 2025]). Footnote 16: Intervenors are several New York City residents who allege they satisfy the Local Law 11 criteria for designation as municipal voters. Footnote 17: This reading of Article IX, section 3 (d) (3) also aligns with Article II's deployment of the words "persons" and "voters" as potentially broader categories than citizens in section three, five, and seven. Additionally, the majority's claim that Article IX uses the term "people," rather than "citizens," because "no one is a citizen of Westchester County, Rochester or any other locality" (majority op at 14) relies on an overly rigid reading of the text. If Article IX, section 1 (a) stated, "[e]very local government . . . shall have a legislative body elective by the citizens residing therein," no one would think that it refers to a "citizen of Westchester County." Rather, one would read the provision as applying to citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of a local government. The majority ignores our basic rule of construction that "[w]hen different terms are used in various parts of a statute . . . it is reasonable to assume that a distinction between them is intended" ( Albano v Kirby , 36 NY2d 526, 530 [1975]). Given how easily the framers could have written Article IX to avoid the potential confusion the majority raises, while still using the term "citizen" to align with Article II, section 1, we must assume that they meant something more meaningful than that when they used the term "people." Footnote 18: The majority claims that "[w]e have repeatedly recognized" that the word "or" may mean "and" to carry out legislative intent (majority op at 17 n 9). However, the majority does not cite a case holding that this same analysis applies to the State Constitution. The majority also ignores Article IX, section 3 (c), which requires the broadest possible reading of the term "people" to effectuate home rule authority. In any event, the majority's analysis fails on its own terms, because its cited caselaw makes clear that this purported rule does not uniformly apply ( see Hale v Sweet , 40 NY 97, 100 [1869] [articulating the rule that "or" may mean "and" in some contexts but deeming that rule inapplicable to the facts of the case]). Footnote 19: As to the majority's claim that "means and includes" is "similar to legal and colloquial expressions like 'whether or not' " (majority op at 16), there is no reason to abandon our longstanding tools of construction to interpret a document as formal and difficult to amend as the State Constitution based on an ostensible similarity to colloquialisms. The majority cites no support, and it cannot, for the proposition that the same informal and redundant language that may acceptably be used in speech, legal motions, or some statutes may also be used in the State Constitution. Footnote 20: My analysis does not require that I decide the meaning of the term "citizen" for the purposes of Article II, section 1, or whether that provision applies only to state elections. By enacting Local Law 11, the City Council sought to enfranchise people whom it assumed are not entitled to vote in local elections based on the language in Article II, section 1. Defendant intervenors hold that same view and contend that Local Law 11 authorized them to vote in municipal elections. Plaintiffs argue that Article II, section 1 limits voting to United States citizens and therefore precludes the City from enfranchising "municipal voters" as defined by Local Law 11 to vote in local elections. Because I interpret the State Constitution as permitting localities to expand the franchise beyond those whom Article II, section 1 guarantees the right to vote, it does not matter for the purposes of my analysis whom Article II, section 1 covers. Footnote 21: The majority is correct that the exception in Article II, section 7 for election of "town officers" does not expressly relate to the term "citizen" in Article II, section 1 ( see majority op at 5 n 3). Its observation does not change the analysis. Indeed, the various provisions of Article II are all consistent with localities enfranchising noncitizens in local elections. No portion of any provision in Article II supports a reading of section 1 as imposing a ceiling on who may vote in local elections. Footnote 22: The majority places undue emphasis on Spitzer 's citation to the 1894 Constitution's Article XII, section 1, which required the legislature to "restrict [a locality's] power of . . . borrowing money . . . so as to prevent abuses in . . . contracting debt," to paint Spitzer 's holding as narrower, and more constrained to local finances, than its plain language supports ( see majority op at 10). If the Spitzer Court intended to limit its rule to financial concerns related to Article XII, section 1, it would have said so. Instead, it repeatedly used the term "private affairs" to describe a separate sphere in which localities have freedom to determine voter qualifications ( see 172 NY at 289-290). Footnote 23: The majority's efforts to distinguish one of these cases, Matter of Esler v Walters , 56 NY2d 306 (1982), on the basis that it only concerned a referendum about consolidating two water districts, cuts against its own argument that Spitzer is limited to issues related to debts given its citation to the 1894 Constitution's Article XII, section 1 ( see majority op at 10 n 6, 11). Moreover, while the Court in Esler observed that the consolidated water district "does not exercise general governmental authority or provide general public services such as housing, transportation, schools or fire and police protection," it presumably considered these factors relevant because voter eligibility was limited to landowning residents, which may have raised equal protection concerns in another context ( see 56 NY2d at 312-314). The majority elucidates no principle to explain how some matters are sufficiently local to fall within Spitzer 's rule for "private affairs" while others are not, even though we have affirmed that the governmental affairs of a locality are not an issue of statewide concern ( see Resnick , 44 NY2d at 285-288). Footnote 24: In Hopper , the challenged law "had made it difficult for those who wanted to vote for one candidate and easy for those who desired to vote for another" ( Johnson , 274 NY at 423). Footnote 25: See e.g. , Pub. Health Law § 2504 (authorizing parents to give consent for medical, dental, health, and hospital services for their child, and reserving that child's right to provide sole consent for such services until they turn 18); Mental Hygiene Law § 33.21 (b) (requiring the consent of a parent or guardian to provide mental health services to a minor, subject to narrow and enumerated exceptions); Domestic Relations Law § 7 (1) (voiding any marriage where either party is under 18); Education Law § 3205 (1) (a) (requiring minors six to 16 to attend full-time educational instruction). We therefore need not worry about the majority's hypothetical world in which adults control where minors live and go to school, significant aspects of their medical treatment, and whether they can marry before 18 years of age, but nevertheless will grant them the right to select the mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and city council member and the right to vote on public referendums. Footnote 26: The majority inaccurately claims that my interpretation of the constitutional grant of home rule authority is "unbounded" ( see majority op at 5 n 2). As explained supra , Article IX authorizes localities to "adopt local laws" (NY Const, art IX, § 1 [a]). At the same time, it empowers the State to "act in relation to the property, affairs or government of any local government . . . by general law" ( id. § 2 [b] [2]; see also id. § 3 [d] [1] [defining a "general law" as "[a] law which in terms and effect applies alike" to all localities]). Thus, as the Municipal Home Rule Law concisely states, "every local government shall have power to adopt and amend local laws not inconsistent with any general law relating to its property, affairs or government" (Municipal Home Rule Law § 10 [1] [i]). The State may therefore enact general laws regarding elections, including prohibiting 13-year-olds to vote, without infringing upon home rule authority. The point is that where, as here, the State has not enacted an absolute prohibition against localities enfranchising noncitizens to vote ( see Section IV, infra ), localities may use their home rule authority to enfranchise noncitizens in local elections. Footnote 27: The majority also provides no support for its bald proposition that during the 1894 Constitutional Convention, there was a "common understanding that the New York Constitution restricted the franchise to U.S. citizens" (majority op at 21-22).
