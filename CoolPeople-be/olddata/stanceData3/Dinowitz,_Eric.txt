New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

CARE stands for Citywide Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Efficiency , and these reforms aim to modernize how residents request and receive city services, ensuring better results and stronger accountability. Accessibility: Making 311 Work for Everyone Live Chat for 311 ( Int. No. 0583-2024 ): Imagine needing to file a 311 request while on the go or in a meeting—this bill introduces live chat functionality, allowing residents to connect with 311 quickly without making a phone call. Video Call Requests ( Int. No. 0640-2024 ): Some problems are easier to show than explain. This bill adds the option for residents to make 311 requests through video calls, enhancing accessibility for those who communicate better visually. Responsiveness: Getting Results Faster Wait Time Estimates for Callers ( Local Law 72 of 2024 ): No more guessing how long you’ll be on hold! This bill, which has already passed , ensures that 311 callers receive estimated wait times, improving the overall experience and saving time. Snow and Ice Removal on Pedestrian Bridges ( Int. No. 0589-2024 ): Slippery pedestrian bridges during winter are a major hazard. This bill ensures New Yorkers can use 311 to request snow and ice removal specifically for pedestrian bridges. Streamlining Duplicate Requests ( Int. No. 0744-2024 ): Duplicate 311 complaints slow everything down. This bill ensures identical requests are consolidated, speeding up resolutions for everyone. Efficiency: Making Every Interaction Count Customer Satisfaction Surveys and Agency Report Cards ( Int. No. 0587-2024 ): This two-part bill, which passed , takes accountability to the next level. Residents can now provide feedback through customer satisfaction surveys after their 311 requests are closed. Additionally, agency report cards will be published to track city agencies’ performance, ensuring they’re held accountable for their successes and shortcomings. Images and Videos for Service Requests ( Int. No. 0588-2024 ): Need to report a pothole or overflowing trash can? This bill allows residents to include photos or videos with their 311 requests, helping city workers understand and resolve issues faster. GPS for Service Requests ( Int. No. 0626-2024 ): Whether you’re in front of a building or in the middle of a park, this bill ensures 311 requests include GPS coordinates so crews know exactly where to go, reducing delays and confusion. Building a Better 311 for All New Yorkers The CARE311 package is about empowering residents, improving service delivery, and making city agencies more transparent and accountable. With two bills already passed and more on the way, Council Member Eric Dinowitz is leading the charge to create a modern 311 system that works for all New Yorkers.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget.

These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more?

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

Such factors may include, but are not limited to, quality of life and public health assessments, and rates and impacts of crime, including but not limited to, crimes involving guns; (d) assessment of the availability and efficacy of various resources and services needed to support or enhance the work of the office and related outcomes, and recommendations for the improvement of such resources and services; and 6.

The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

Oversight Not available Not available Int 0408-2024 * Public Advocate Jumaane Williams Creating a division within the department of small business services to assist street vendors and requiring the commissioner of small business services to update the department’s programs to facilitate street vendor access. Introduction This bill would create a Division of Street Vendor Assistance within the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to assist street vendors. The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors. Further, the Commissioner would be required to annually submit to the Speaker and the Mayor, and publish on the SBS website, a report on the updating of SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations and a report on the Division’s assistance of street vendors.

Introduction This bill would increase the number of food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses available each year for five years, and then it would lift the cap on food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses. This bill would also expand training to include information related to the particular vending restrictions of the license holder. Not available Not available Int 1164-2025 * Joann Ariola Requiring an interagency portal to track street vending enforcement. Introduction This bill would require the Office of Street Vendor Enforcement (OSVE) to create a portal that would allow all agencies enforcing street vending laws and regulations to share enforcement-related information. OSVE would also ensure that each enforcing agency has the capability to verify the authenticity of vendor licenses. Not available Not available Int 1251-2025 * Amanda Farías Issuing supervisory licenses to mobile food vendors. Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

Oversight Not available Not available Int 0408-2024 * Public Advocate Jumaane Williams Creating a division within the department of small business services to assist street vendors and requiring the commissioner of small business services to update the department’s programs to facilitate street vendor access. Introduction This bill would create a Division of Street Vendor Assistance within the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to assist street vendors. The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors. Further, the Commissioner would be required to annually submit to the Speaker and the Mayor, and publish on the SBS website, a report on the updating of SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations and a report on the Division’s assistance of street vendors.

Introduction This bill would increase the number of food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses available each year for five years, and then it would lift the cap on food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses.

Not available Not available Int 1164-2025 * Joann Ariola Requiring an interagency portal to track street vending enforcement. Introduction This bill would require the Office of Street Vendor Enforcement (OSVE) to create a portal that would allow all agencies enforcing street vending laws and regulations to share enforcement-related information. OSVE would also ensure that each enforcing agency has the capability to verify the authenticity of vendor licenses. Not available Not available Int 1251-2025 * Amanda Farías Issuing supervisory licenses to mobile food vendors. Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up. This community made Eric who he is — and in return, he's devoted his entire career to giving back. Read More Since his election to the City Council in the spring of 2021, Eric has been hard at work delivering for the North Bronx. He’s secured millions for our community and fought to keep our neighborhoods safe and healthy by investing in resources to prevent gun violence and hosting vaccine clinics. As chair of the Committee on Higher Education, Eric has worked to make CUNY more accessible for all New Yorkers and as chair of the Jewish Caucus, he has worked diligently to combat the rise in antisemitism. His office has focused on food insecurity and has hosted monthly mobile food pantries. He’s a strong advocate for older adults and a sponsor of bills to provide protections for older adults that may be at risk of losing their homes. As a product of the Bronx's public schools, Eric has a personal investment in the success of our students. He was a special education teacher in our community for twelve years, teaching and counseling the students who need the most support. As a former chapter leader in the United Federation of Teachers, he advocated for workers' rights and fought for fair working conditions and to protect teachers' pensions. Eric was also an engaged leader outside school. As chair of the Aging Committee on Community Board 8, Eric worked to support older adults and to make our community a more caring place for them. He also served as a Democratic District Leader, advocating for voter access and ensuring residents have the tools needed to cast their ballots. Eric is a devoted father and husband. He and his wife Tamar are raising their two sons, Alex and Jesse, right here in the Northwest Bronx -- and that means his fight for families is personal. GET INVOLVED Sign up to volunteer Eric’s Accomplishments Our City Council Member Eric Dinowitz hit the ground running after being elected in 2021 and he’s not slowing down. No matter who you are – a student, an older adult, a person with a disability, or a working parent – Eric has made sure your voice is heard at City Hall and he’s delivering for you. As Chair of the Higher Education Committee, he’s fought to strengthen our city’s higher education system and create more opportunities for students. Eric also serves as co-Chair of the Bronx Delegation – working with his Bronx colleagues to address food insecurity and secure millions in capital investments, like hospital improvements. As Chair of the Jewish Caucus, Eric has fought back against the rise in antisemitism and hate crimes by working with other marginalized groups to make them a priority for the city. Eric was selected by Speaker Adrienne Adams to be a member of the Budget Negotiating Team, and he fought for priorities in our city budget that otherwise wouldn’t have been included, such as funding to re-engage vulnerable students to finish their degrees at CUNY and over a million dollars for a brand-new anti-hate crime initiative. Keeping our communities safe - combating the rise in hate crimes, removing illegal guns, secured $100,000 in funding for community safety initiative including victim services and crime prevention, expanded the B-Heard pilot program which utilizes mental health professionals during mental health 911 calls, and making public transit and our streets safer Overcoming COVID and ensuring a healthier NYC - expanding access to vaccines and tests, secured funding for hospital upgrades, and addressed food insecurity Advocating for older adults - saved a senior center from closure, co-sponsors legislation to keep older adults in their homes, and delivered support for senior nourish programs Empowering our students - secured major investments in our schools, expanded access to CUNY, and increased funding for libraries Advocating for a progressive future - Eric continues to stand against Republican extremism and wealthy special interests to fight for our Democratic values Join Eric  JOIN THE CAMPAIGN  VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Join Eric Email Address JOIN THE CAMPAIGN Thank you! VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up. This community made Eric who he is — and in return, he's devoted his entire career to giving back. Read More Since his election to the City Council in the spring of 2021, Eric has been hard at work delivering for the North Bronx. He’s secured millions for our community and fought to keep our neighborhoods safe and healthy by investing in resources to prevent gun violence and hosting vaccine clinics. As chair of the Committee on Higher Education, Eric has worked to make CUNY more accessible for all New Yorkers and as chair of the Jewish Caucus, he has worked diligently to combat the rise in antisemitism. His office has focused on food insecurity and has hosted monthly mobile food pantries. He’s a strong advocate for older adults and a sponsor of bills to provide protections for older adults that may be at risk of losing their homes. As a product of the Bronx's public schools, Eric has a personal investment in the success of our students. He was a special education teacher in our community for twelve years, teaching and counseling the students who need the most support. As a former chapter leader in the United Federation of Teachers, he advocated for workers' rights and fought for fair working conditions and to protect teachers' pensions. Eric was also an engaged leader outside school. As chair of the Aging Committee on Community Board 8, Eric worked to support older adults and to make our community a more caring place for them. He also served as a Democratic District Leader, advocating for voter access and ensuring residents have the tools needed to cast their ballots. Eric is a devoted father and husband. He and his wife Tamar are raising their two sons, Alex and Jesse, right here in the Northwest Bronx -- and that means his fight for families is personal. GET INVOLVED Sign up to volunteer Eric’s Accomplishments Our City Council Member Eric Dinowitz hit the ground running after being elected in 2021 and he’s not slowing down. No matter who you are – a student, an older adult, a person with a disability, or a working parent – Eric has made sure your voice is heard at City Hall and he’s delivering for you. As Chair of the Higher Education Committee, he’s fought to strengthen our city’s higher education system and create more opportunities for students. Eric also serves as co-Chair of the Bronx Delegation – working with his Bronx colleagues to address food insecurity and secure millions in capital investments, like hospital improvements. As Chair of the Jewish Caucus, Eric has fought back against the rise in antisemitism and hate crimes by working with other marginalized groups to make them a priority for the city. Eric was selected by Speaker Adrienne Adams to be a member of the Budget Negotiating Team, and he fought for priorities in our city budget that otherwise wouldn’t have been included, such as funding to re-engage vulnerable students to finish their degrees at CUNY and over a million dollars for a brand-new anti-hate crime initiative. Keeping our communities safe - combating the rise in hate crimes, removing illegal guns, secured $100,000 in funding for community safety initiative including victim services and crime prevention, expanded the B-Heard pilot program which utilizes mental health professionals during mental health 911 calls, and making public transit and our streets safer Overcoming COVID and ensuring a healthier NYC - expanding access to vaccines and tests, secured funding for hospital upgrades, and addressed food insecurity Advocating for older adults - saved a senior center from closure, co-sponsors legislation to keep older adults in their homes, and delivered support for senior nourish programs Empowering our students - secured major investments in our schools, expanded access to CUNY, and increased funding for libraries Advocating for a progressive future - Eric continues to stand against Republican extremism and wealthy special interests to fight for our Democratic values Join Eric  JOIN THE CAMPAIGN  VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up.

VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up. This community made Eric who he is — and in return, he's devoted his entire career to giving back. Read More Since his election to the City Council in the spring of 2021, Eric has been hard at work delivering for the North Bronx. He’s secured millions for our community and fought to keep our neighborhoods safe and healthy by investing in resources to prevent gun violence and hosting vaccine clinics. As chair of the Committee on Higher Education, Eric has worked to make CUNY more accessible for all New Yorkers and as chair of the Jewish Caucus, he has worked diligently to combat the rise in antisemitism. His office has focused on food insecurity and has hosted monthly mobile food pantries. He’s a strong advocate for older adults and a sponsor of bills to provide protections for older adults that may be at risk of losing their homes. As a product of the Bronx's public schools, Eric has a personal investment in the success of our students. He was a special education teacher in our community for twelve years, teaching and counseling the students who need the most support. As a former chapter leader in the United Federation of Teachers, he advocated for workers' rights and fought for fair working conditions and to protect teachers' pensions. Eric was also an engaged leader outside school. As chair of the Aging Committee on Community Board 8, Eric worked to support older adults and to make our community a more caring place for them. He also served as a Democratic District Leader, advocating for voter access and ensuring residents have the tools needed to cast their ballots. Eric is a devoted father and husband. He and his wife Tamar are raising their two sons, Alex and Jesse, right here in the Northwest Bronx -- and that means his fight for families is personal. GET INVOLVED Sign up to volunteer Eric’s Accomplishments Our City Council Member Eric Dinowitz hit the ground running after being elected in 2021 and he’s not slowing down. No matter who you are – a student, an older adult, a person with a disability, or a working parent – Eric has made sure your voice is heard at City Hall and he’s delivering for you. As Chair of the Higher Education Committee, he’s fought to strengthen our city’s higher education system and create more opportunities for students. Eric also serves as co-Chair of the Bronx Delegation – working with his Bronx colleagues to address food insecurity and secure millions in capital investments, like hospital improvements. As Chair of the Jewish Caucus, Eric has fought back against the rise in antisemitism and hate crimes by working with other marginalized groups to make them a priority for the city. Eric was selected by Speaker Adrienne Adams to be a member of the Budget Negotiating Team, and he fought for priorities in our city budget that otherwise wouldn’t have been included, such as funding to re-engage vulnerable students to finish their degrees at CUNY and over a million dollars for a brand-new anti-hate crime initiative. Keeping our communities safe - combating the rise in hate crimes, removing illegal guns, secured $100,000 in funding for community safety initiative including victim services and crime prevention, expanded the B-Heard pilot program which utilizes mental health professionals during mental health 911 calls, and making public transit and our streets safer Overcoming COVID and ensuring a healthier NYC - expanding access to vaccines and tests, secured funding for hospital upgrades, and addressed food insecurity Advocating for older adults - saved a senior center from closure, co-sponsors legislation to keep older adults in their homes, and delivered support for senior nourish programs Empowering our students - secured major investments in our schools, expanded access to CUNY, and increased funding for libraries Advocating for a progressive future - Eric continues to stand against Republican extremism and wealthy special interests to fight for our Democratic values Join Eric  JOIN THE CAMPAIGN  VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTE ISSUES ABOUT Eric Dinowitz A TEACHER FIGHTING FOR OUR RECOVERY Council Member Eric Dinowitz is proud to call the Northwest Bronx home — he's lived here his entire life, and now, he and his wife are raising their family right in the neighborhood where he grew up.
