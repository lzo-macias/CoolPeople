As a member of Community Board 8, I sat on the Land Use and Zoning Committees. I experienced first hand the important and grueling ULURP process and know what it is like to critically examine housing proposals. We are in the midst of an affordability and housing crisis.

There are five core strategies I will prioritize on the Council.   1. Protect current stock of affordable housing 1. Protect current stock of affordable housing   Reports show that NYC affordable housing saw a net loss of over 150,000 units, over 75% since 2019. In 2023 alone, there was an estimated net loss of over 4,000 rent-stabilized units. Units are being deregulated, often illegally.

Units are being deregulated, often illegally.   We must protect the affordable housing stock we have. We cannot accept a decline in the percentage of affordable units as street homelessness increases. Affordable housing is key to creating a just and safe city.

Hold HPD and DOB accountable for enforcing affordable housing requirements.   Agreements to develop new affordable housing units are great, but they’re worthless if they aren’t enforced.  We've seen numerous instances where development with permitted FAR increases under Mandatory Inclusionary Housing didn’t follow through and complete the promised affordable housing, especially when affordable housing was permitted to be off-site. Oversight is essential to tackling the housing challenge and the only way we can that ensure that the new Universal Affordability Preference program will succeed.

Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible 3. Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible   The current office vacancy rate in Midtown is 20 percent. Many of these empty spaces must be repurposed as residential housing as we seek to optimize our current spaces alongside the creation of new housing. We can build up to 85,000 new mixed-income units in Midtown Manhattan by increasing allowable density on sites where residential towers are already permitted.

Prioritize age in place housing for seniors 4 . Prioritize age in place housing for seniors   We need to ensure that seniors have access to rental assistance programs as well as accessibility upgrades and in-home care. We must ensure that they are protected against harassment and know their rights under the right to counsel law. We must build vibrant communities where seniors can age-in-place in the neighborhoods they built and sustained.

Build modern middle class housing   City of Yes is a start to the larger project of ensuring the middle-class can thrive in our city. But City of Yes, on its own, is only estimated to result in about 5,000 new units per year across the whole city. That’s not going to be enough, especially in District 4 where we’ve seen plenty of development, but not enough new housing to show for it.

That’s not going to be enough, especially in District 4 where we’ve seen plenty of development, but not enough new housing to show for it.   We must be vigilant in ensuring new construction meets affordability targets. For example, what we have seen, including right across the street from my apartment, are tenements with affordable housing being torn down so that towers with a relatively small number of enormous apartments can be built, meaning that even when developers participate in mandatory inclusionary housing and comply with their legal obligations, we end up with fewer affordable units than we had before. This isn’t acceptable, and it isn’t going to help solve the crisis. We must be vigilant in ensuring new construction meets affordability targets.

Safer Communities and Accessibility I am serious about public safety. We deserve to feel safe in our homes, on our streets and sidewalks, and in our subway stations. I will champion proven solutions to reduce crime and to combat antisemitism and other forms of bigotry. Our synagogues shouldn’t need to hire extra security guards to prevent vandalism, and our immigrant neighbors should feel safe going to work without the fear of being deported.

I’ve heard the concerns of residents about a range of street safety issues from e-bikes and scooters, from individuals riding mopeds on the sidewalks to careless behavior in bike lanes that leaves pedestrians feeling like they could be hit at any moment while trying to cross the street. I’ve spent the last four years pushing my children in strollers, so I know how it feels like you could be hit at any moment while trying to cross the street or even get on or off the bus.

I’ve spent the last four years pushing my children in strollers, so I know how it feels like you could be hit at any moment while trying to cross the street or even get on or off the bus.   We’ve made progress on pressing street safety issues with help from state-level officials. Mopeds, motorbikes and e-scooters will now be registered at point of sale. This is a huge win against the crisis of unlicensed vehicles endangering pedestrians. That said, we have more work to do.

We need to hold delivery services accountable for unsafe practices they’re forcing on workers, such as time targets that can’t be met  when following basic safety and legal rules. These companies are endangering our neighbors and hiding behind workers to avoid taking responsibility for the harm they’re causing.

Strong, Protected Public Education As a former public school teacher and current public school parent, I have both the context to understand the complex issues facing local schools and the commitment to deliver results for families and the future of our city. I served on Community Board 8, where I chaired the Youth, Education, & Libraries Committee and was a member of the UFT and AFSA.

Right now, the systems meant to provide care are fragmented, under-resourced, and burdened by bureaucracy leaving too many vulnerable New Yorkers without support.

Housing First Housing First We need a long-term, comprehensive approach to permanent housing and mental health care for low-income New Yorkers. I support Housing First policies that prioritize providing permanent housing without preconditions, a proven, cost-effective strategy used successfully in countries like Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Japan. This approach helps prevent recurring homelessness and addresses root causes early. We need a long-term, comprehensive approach to permanent housing and mental health care for low-income New Yorkers.

Improving Homeless Services Through Coordinated Data Systems Improving Homeless Services Through Coordinated Data Systems Roughly 2,500 unsheltered individuals regularly interact with City services, from law enforcement to hospitals to nonprofits. Yet outdated technology means these systems can’t share vital information. As a result, outreach workers and first responders often engage with people without knowing their history or existing supports. By integrating these systems—with strong privacy protections—we can make interventions safer, more effective, and more humane.

Protecting and Expanding Inpatient Mental Health Care Protecting and Expanding Inpatient Mental Health Care We must preserve and expand inpatient care for people with severe mental illness. I’m fighting to stop the closure of Mount Sinai Beth Israel and protect the 153 behavioral health beds at risk. I also support Borough President Mark Levine’s push to expand the Transition to Home program at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center, which could serve far more patients than it currently does. Additionally, I back his proposal for student loan forgiveness to help recruit and retain psychiatric care professionals at NYC Health + Hospitals.

Clean streets are not only important for the dignity of neighborhoods but a matter of public health. We’ve seen some progress on sanitation, including a reduction in the number of rats on our streets, but we have more work to do. We should be able to take pride in our streets.

We must also hold commercial spaces accountable for adhering to sanitation laws by ensuring proper and equal enforcement. Improperly containerized business waste is not only unpleasant but encourages rodents onto our sidewalks. I will work productively with local businesses to not only ensure compliance but that business owners have the support and information they need to remain in compliance.

End Pay-to-Play Politics Ban Contributions from City Contractors : Vanessa will work to ban campaign contributions, bundling, and Independent Expenditures from individuals or entities doing business with the city. This will prevent contractors from using political donations to buy influence. Extend Contribution Restrictions : Vanessa supports extending restrictions on contributions from contractors and lobbyists for at least one year after their city business concludes, to end “thank you” donations. Stop Big Donors Buying Elections : Vanessa advocates for lowering contribution limits for non-participants in the NYC Matching Funds Program at parity with current contribution limits for participants. This will give more power and influence to small donors resident in New York. Restrict Foreign Influence : Vanessa will advocate that NYC follow the lead of other U.S. cities in preventing corporations with 1% or more foreign ownership from contributing to political spending in city elections.

Prevent and Reduce Hate Crimes in NYC   Last year alone, 641 hate crimes were reported to police in New York City. After steady annual increases in hate crimes since 2016, this marks the highest rate yet. Reports show that these crimes targeted several minority groups including members of the LGBTQ+ community, Asian Americans, African Americans, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews, attacks against whom comprised more than 54% of the total hate crimes reported in 2024.

Establish a 24-hour Hate Crimes Hotline to improve reporting   The upward trend of hate crimes reporting in NYC is disturbing, but we know that many more instances remain unreported. In order to effectively reduce hate crimes, the City needs to make reporting easier, safer, and more effective to better understand the scope of the problem. Currently, NYC’s Hate Crimes Task Force can only be contacted (at 1-888-392-3644) Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Vanessa advocates for the establishment of an easy-to-remember hotline open 24/7 for victims and bystanders to accurately and efficiently report hate crimes.

Expand Hate Crimes Training to Prosecutors and Judges 2. Expand Hate Crimes Training to Prosecutors and Judges   In addition to training for law enforcement, prosecutors and judges should be required to undergo specialized training for how to identify and investigate possible hate crimes. Prosecutors should be trained to thoroughly examine the possibility that racial, homophobic or other hatred may have been a motivating factor in an attack, to order further investigative steps where necessary, and to put hate motivation forward as a factor in sentencing where appropriate. Judges should receive further training on how to identify and assess relevant evidence of hate motivation, and when to take it into account.

Expand local backing for specialized victim support organizations 3. Expand local backing for specialized victim support organizations   In New York City, there is an urgent need to expand local support for specialized victim support organizations, especially in light of recent funding cuts to Safe Horizon, which has traditionally relied on federal government funding. With these defunding efforts, it becomes even more critical to ensure the continued existence and growth of organizations that offer vital services to victims. These services—free-of-charge, confidential, pro-victim, and voluntary—are essential for those in need, particularly when they prefer to remain anonymous. Organizations like Safe Horizon provide crucial emotional support, information on legal options, guidance on financial assistance, and help with public relations. Additionally, they play a key role in accompanying victims to the police station or court, offering a sense of safety and advocacy. In a time when resources are shrinking, it is vital that we prioritize and strengthen these services, not diminish them, to ensure all victims in our community have access to the support they deserve.

Vibrant Aging in Place Our seniors deserve the dignity of aging in place with support for all they’ve contributed to the success of our city. We must invest in social programs and technology that allow seniors to remain in the homes that connect them to family, friends, and their communities.

Gaining access to critical city services feels increasingly unwieldy. Too often, following up on a city issue feels like shouting into a void, pointless and exhausting.

LGBTQ+ Inclusion and Safety New York City must be a place where LGBTQ+ individuals are not just protected, but empowered to live and thrive. That means standing firm against discrimination, investing in safety and opportunity, and ensuring that the protections under our state constitution are enforced with integrity and accountability.

Uphold the NY State Equal Rights Amendment 1. Uphold the NY State Equal Rights Amendment The New York State Equal Rights Amendment makes it unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. NYU Langone’s decision to deny medically necessary healthcare - specifically gender-affirming care for patients under 19 - is not only immoral, it’s illegal. I have proudly stood with advocates to demand those canceled appointments be reinstated immediately. As your Council Member, I will provide rigorous oversight and ensure healthcare providers in our district follow the law and deliver inclusive, affirming care.

Protect the Rights of Sex Workers Sex workers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I support the Sex Worker Protection Act and the removal of the NYPD VICE Squad, which has a documented history of violence and abuse towards sex workers. I will fight to uphold the rights and safety of sex workers, including trans women of color who are disproportionately impacted by criminalization, stigma, and police violence.

Local activist Vanessa Aronson (center) is the latest to throw her hat into the ring to succeed term-limited Keith Powers in Manhattanâs district four City Council race. At least four others have said they covet the seat as well with a primary sometime in June 2025. Photo: Courtesy Vanessa Aronson Elections come, elections go. Running for office seems like forever. And, with term limits, prospective candidates are always eyeing the next open seat. Some are praying. Others preying. Come November 2024, City Council District 5 incumbent Julie Menin is up for re-election. The highly regarded Council Member didnât have a primary and is running unopposed. So sheâs hoping to help other Dems win. But running for office and helping other Democrats get elected still requires funds. So Jerry Ferguson, president of Four Freedoms Democratic Club, hosted a fundraiser for Menin in his home to a packed crowd of the party faithful and supporters. In a short speech, Menin reported on what sheâs done and is doing on the Council, and her introduction of the âSafe Hotelâs Actâ which will require every NYC hotel to be licensed through the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Onward. And now for 2025. The City Council seat that will open in November 2025, when Keith Powersâ term-limited term is up, is generating lots and lots of interest. Powers said heâll be running for Manhattan Borough President. Up until a week or so ago, there were four candidates who were fund raisingâFaith Bondy, Rachel Storch, Ben Wetzler and Lukas Florczakâwhich I wrote about in an East Side Observer column in June âHeading to Hot 2025 Primary Battle.â We still have not hear from Lukas Florczak so weâre not sure of the status of his campaign. But now comes a fifth candidate, Vanessa Aronson who resides on the UES with her husband Reid Aronson, and two young sons, Levari and Tavi. Her background includes being president of the Lexington Democratic Club, Community Board 8 member, NYC public school teacher and working in nonprofit strategy. Aronsonâs an alum of U of Chicago, Harvard, and Relay Graduate School of Education. At a recent meet and greet, she thanked her supporters and said, âI am absolutely thrilled by the outpouring of community support weâre seeing for the campaign. Weâre building a winning coalition, and I canât wait to speak with voters throughout District 4 about the issues that matter to them.â Welcome to the race Vanishing Neighborhood NewsâWankelâs, the forever hardware store on Third Ave between E. 88th and E. 89th Sts, is forever gone. It occupied two storefronts and after it was sold, each storefront was going to be occupied by separate businesses. One was to be Taim. Not happening despite at least a yearâs worth of signage, all kinds of carpentry, fixing up, whatever. Remains empty. The second storefront is actually happening. Itâs Miaâs Brooklyn Bakery. Not yet open, it has a location in Times Square and, obviously, in Brooklyn, where it was founded in 2015 in the boroughâs Boerum Hill according to Patch.
