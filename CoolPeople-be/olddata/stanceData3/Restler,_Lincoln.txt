0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu District 33 Initiatives Climate Action Roadmap The climate crisis is not a far-off threat‚Äîit‚Äôs happening now. The livelihoods of New Yorkers are at risk when our homes flood, our apartments overheat, and our businesses are destroyed by extreme weather events. Today, we released a Climate Action Roadmap for the 33rd District. The goal is to drive down emissions using every tool the New York City Council has: pass legislation, fund initiatives, provide rigorous oversight & organize winning campaigns. üå± Learn more! Street Tree Plan for District 33 We‚Äôre planting 3,400 street trees in District 33 over the next 4 years -- filling every viable street tree pit. When I talk to experts about fighting back against climate change - a solution I hear most often is surprisingly simple: trees. This plan will get us one step closer to lowering the urban heat island effect & keeping our communities safer from the climate crisis Learn more! It‚Äôs Time to #CloseRikers Mass incarceration is an epic policy failure. Council Member Kevin Riley and I crafted an action plan of 19 policy initiatives, investments & legislation to end mass incarceration in NYC & #CloseRikers. We‚Äôve laid out actions & investments that the Council & Mayor can act on today to put us back on track to close Rikers by 2027. Closing Rikers is a moral imperative & it‚Äôs time to get serious about implementing the policies to make it happen. Learn more! Community Clean Up We launched a Community Cleanup Plan for the 33rd based on results of a survey of residents and a review of thousands of in-district 311 complaints from 2021. There‚Äôs a  demonstrated need for a renewed focus on improving the cleanliness of our streets & sidewalks and public spaces, including our neighborhood parks. Learn more! District 33‚Äôs Dog Runs üê∂ We launched our report for new & improved dog runs in District 33 & New York City! We're opening new dog runs, investing in existing ones, introducing new bills to ensure there are dog runs in every neighborhood & making New York City Parks maintain dog run conditions. More dog infrastructure means happier dogs who have their own spaces. It also means Park areas where dogs aren‚Äôt permitted are cleaner too. It's hard to be a dog in NYC. Our beloved pets deserve a place to run around & socialize. Let's make it happen in D33 & across NYC! Learn more!

Meet Me I have fought hard to ensure that City government delivers for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. I am a neighborhood kid born, raised, and always Brooklyn. I grew up in a tight knit community on Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn Heights in the 80s and 90s. I graduated from neighborhood schools, had my bar mitzvah in a local church with a famed abolitionist history, and reached my sporting peak at 7 years old playing tee-ball in Cadman Plaza Park. I was raised in a home that valued our community. A normal evening included tagging along with mom to a board meeting of the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society, which provides early childhood education for public housing residents, or having an early dinner with dad before he spent the evening volunteering with New Yorkers experiencing homelessness at our neighborhood synagogue on Remsen Street. Learning from my parents, my grandparents, and my big sister, led me to public service. Shortly after college, when I came home to Brooklyn, I learned about how corrupt and dysfunctional the Brooklyn Democratic Party was under the leadership of boss Vito Lopez and I decided to do something about it. I was a founding member of a group called New Kings Democrats. Ever since 2008, we have been a thorn in the side of the machine bosses and the status quo, working to bring transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics. I am a neighborhood kid Since 2008, we have been a thorn in the side of the machine bosses and the status quo, working to bring transparency, accountability and integrity to Brooklyn politics. Back then the corrupt party machine dominated Brooklyn politics and reformers had nowhere to go. Against all odds and the full power of the party machine, we ran an insurgent campaign and I won a tight election in 2010 to become the District Leader in Greenpoint and Williamsburg. I took on the machine in one of its strongholds, and started a people-powered movement that has continued electing reformers to this day. The position didn‚Äôt come with a salary, but it afforded a platform to advocate and solve problems. As District Leader, working with the community, I helped open a new supermarket in a food desert - and got 90% of the jobs to go to local public housing residents. We secured new open spaces and community gardens on Java Street and Myrtle Avenue, and we fought successfully to permanently extend the G train south into Park Slope and Kensington. Today, more progressives than ever before are active and voting in local democratic primaries and holding their leaders accountable. We need to keep that spark alive in order to turn political activism into a government that works for the people. I believe this so strongly because I have spent most of my career as a public servant in New York City government. For a decade, I was given opportunities to create changes I believed in and to challenge policies I opposed. I have seen the underbelly of government and I know that getting big things done requires tenacity, creativity, and unwavering values. I have fought hard to ensure that City government delivers for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. In 2014, I led the design and implementation of IDNYC , which can now be found in the wallets of over 1 million New Yorkers - providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city‚Äôs 600,000 undocumented residents. For ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù New Yorkers, I negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of people. I‚Äôve worked tirelessly to open shelters and supportive housing developments for people experiencing homelessness, and I have successfully advanced more protected bicycle lanes and busways. I love being a part of the organizations and institutions that make Brooklyn special. I have served as a board member of Community Board 2, the Brooklyn Public Library, IMPACCT (an affordable housing and tenant organizing group), and more. I most recently worked at St. Nicks Alliance, a 45-year-old community based organization in Williamsburg, where we run job training and placement programs, provide early childhood and afterschool programs, offer quality senior services, and organize and empower tenants. Since college, I have rented four different apartments over 11 years across Greenpoint. I currently live with my girlfriend in an apartment in one of our neighborhood‚Äôs quintessential clapboard buildings on Lorimer Street. I believe deeply in the DIY ethos of our community and I know that no problem, whether big or small, fixes itself - you have to roll up your sleeves and fight with everything you've got. This has been especially true since COVID hit. I‚Äôve set up multiple food distribution initiatives each week at public housing developments and joined regular park clean-ups across our community to work with others to respond to our new normal. Being your Council Member would be the most important job I ever hold. It would be my honor to lift up our community and fight like hell alongside you to realize the district we deserve.

We are committing to plant 3,400 new street trees, so that every viable street tree location is filled across our community, and we will strive to ensure street trees across our community are well cared for! Tackling the climate crisis at the local level is a top priority of our Council office. In May, we released our Climate Road Map , spelling out the actions we are taking to mitigate the climate crisis in District 33. One critical goal is to reduce the urban heat effect. With record breaking heat waves over the past few summers, we are no strangers to the increased prevalence of extreme weather -- which poses serious health risks for our most vulnerable community members. When I talk to experts about fighting back against climate change - the solution I hear most often is surprisingly simple: trees. Improving and stewarding our tree canopy is one of the most consequential ways we can lower urban heat and protect our health in the face of this climate crisis. Moreover, a healthy tree canopy has a huge number of other environmental, social, biodiversity and economic benefits. Here‚Äôs how we can realize these benefits together: Plant More Trees! We are going to plant 3,400 new street trees! In coordination with my office, the NYC Parks Department has committed to planting 2,200 trees over the next four years.

Here are some quick tips that you can share with neighbors to help ensure that the street trees in front of your home or business are being cared for. Remove refuse from the tree bed and weed. (Please be careful not to pull intentional plantings by neighbors.) Cultivate the soil by adding compost (only ¬Ω inch per year) and mulch, but please protect the tree roots. Loosen soil gently (max 1 inch deep) to alleviate compaction. Mix in a thin layer of compost (max ¬Ω inch deep). Add a layer of mulch (max 2 inches deep) to help keep the soil moist and reduce weeds. Keep compost and mulch at least 6 inches away from the trunk and major roots. Water your street trees once a week between May and October and water them slowly. (15-20 gallons or 3-4 large buckets, at 1 gallon per minute). Plant carefully around street trees. Choose small and shallow rooted annuals, perennials, and bulbs that require minimal watering and plant them at least a foot away from the tree trunk. Avoid digging large holes and planting large plants that may damage tree roots. Please be mindful not to raise the soil level around the tree roots. And, of course, only plant if you are going to water. District 33 Street Tree Plan! Our office is thrilled to announce an ambitious street tree plan for District 33!

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Council Members Kevin Riley & Lincoln Restler: A Pathway to Ending Mass Incarceration in New York City Prioritize Safely Moving People Off Rikers Expand Access to Housing Expedite Case Processing INTRODUCTION In 2019, the New York City Council took the long-overdue step of voting to close Rikers Island. By law, the jails must be closed by August 31, 2027. For decades, Rikers Island has been an inhumane jail complex that exposes vulnerable New Yorkers to trauma and instability and leaves people in worse condition than when they entered. 36 incarcerated people have died in the last two years. Violence threatens everyone inside the jails, and the City remains unable to consistently provide basic services or consistently deliver pre-trial detainees to court hearings. 90% of the people on Rikers are Black or Latinx. Black people are jailed at 11.6 times the rate of white people in our city. Beyond the humanitarian crisis Rikers represents, this treatment of people in jail decreases stability and pushes safety further away for New York City as a whole. Closing Rikers is an essential step to reforming our criminal justice system and delivering the safety New Yorkers deserve . However, our ability to close Rikers requires an incarcerated population of 3,600 or less ‚Äì the maximum capacity of the secure hospital beds and borough jail system that will replace Rikers. It is essential that our city have a comprehensive plan to safely and permanently reduce the jail population and end mass incarceration, while building a resilient system able to withstand potential future shocks that might drive up crime. This requires scaling up tried and tested policies and programs proven to increase safety and well-being. The Adams Administration has not presented any plan to achieve the mandate to Close Rikers by 2027. They have irresponsibly speculated about a rising jail population and rolled back previous initiatives that helped lower the population. So, the Council must lead. Rikers Island will not close if we do not act now. Together, we can take concrete, proven steps to safely reduce the population on Rikers and close the Island by focusing on the following three principles: Prioritize safely moving people off Rikers Island. Expand access to housing - especially supportive housing. Expedite case processing. These principles will take time to implement comprehensively‚Äîbut New Yorkers cannot afford to wait. The City Council must take the following immediate steps to get the closure of Rikers back on track: PRIORITIZE SAFELY MOVING PEOPLE OFF RIKERS New York City‚Äôs jails are full of people who should not be there. Almost 90% of those on Rikers Island are presumed innocent and awaiting trial, and one in every two people has a diagnosed mental illness. We need to divert people before they enter Rikers Island, connecting them to the community-based services they need instead of jail. In addition to diversion, judges, attorneys, and City agencies should identify and prioritize people already in jail who can safely be released with proper support. Immediately pass Council Member Carlina Rivera‚Äôs Population Review Team legislation (Intro. 806) and begin identifying people who can be safely released, as well as collaborating to resolve stalled cases. This should include early holistic assessments of people on Rikers to ensure their needs are fully considered. Increase Supervised Release program funding by $28 million (to a total of $100 million) and work with relevant stakeholders, including District Attorneys, Defenders, and the Office of Court Administration, to establish and build support for a more intensive supervised release model that connects people to mental health care, substance use, and other resources. By supporting higher-need program participants, the City will be able to decrease the number of people entering Rikers. Longer term, the Council should consider allocating funds for a fully staffed and resourced Pretrial Services Agency to manage this program. Enhance funding for Alternative to Incarceration (ATI) Programs and Alternative to Detention Programs (ATD) by $34 million . Half the nearly 6,000 people on Rikers Island have a mental health diagnosis. The city must fund ATI programs to levels adequate to meet the needs of this population, connecting people to the services they need rather than jail, and seek to address gaps in the current network to work with people facing a broader range of charges and higher levels of need. Urge the Adams administration to accelerate the construction of outposted therapeutic housing beds at Bellevue, Woodhull, and North Central Bronx . These are secure hospital beds that would be used for the most ill people currently at Rikers. The City has already allocated capital funds for 380 therapeutic beds and has the staff available to operate them ‚Äînow the Administration must follow through and bring them online as soon as possible. The sooner that happens, the sooner these people can avoid Rikers. In parallel, the City should fund additional therapeutic beds and invest in increased capacity to expand the population targeted for therapeutic beds, including people with mental illness. Call on the Mayor to immediately appoint two more members to the Local Conditional Release Commission , so it can start its work to safely reduce lengths of sentences. Demand DOC Commissioner Molina to greatly expand the use of the 6-A Early Release Program , which was successfully used during the pandemic to identify individuals for supervised release. Encourage the Adams administration to collaborate with the State to move remaining sentenced individuals to a New York State Correctional Facility in New York City, which will spare them the harm of Rikers and enable people to take part in established re-entry and work release programs, setting them up for success post-release. Pass legislation to require quarterly progress reports on the Administration‚Äôs efforts to reduce unnecessary incarceration , including staffing and budget resources dedicated to this. Reports should include anticipated resources required to reduce the jail population below 3,600. 2. EXPAND ACCESS TO HOUSING People experiencing homelessness need homes, not jail, but New York City incarcerates roughly 2,600 unhoused people whose behavioral needs should qualify them for supportive housing - permanent affordable housing with wrap-around services. Often, judges are reluctant to release people without homes, and the likelihood of rearrest is higher among people facing housing instability. To advance safety and justice, New York City must increase funding and access to housing options that connect vulnerable people with stable places to live and the services they need to thrive. Pass legislation or take executive action to amend the homeless eligibility requirement for the NYC 15/15 supportive housing program to include time in jail as time considered homeless . If a person enters jail or prison homeless, their time incarcerated should count towards being homeless. Currently incarceration does not count towards homeless eligibility criteria and much like shelters, jails and prisons are not meant for permanent or ongoing habitation. The 15/15 program also needs an additional $45 million investment to support rental subsidy increases and higher services rates to fill and operate the remaining units. Increase funding for Justice Involved Supportive Housing (JISH) by $26 million to serve more people with the highest jail and shelter use who have mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Although JISH has been proven effective, only 120 beds exist ‚Äì and even those are inadequately funded. The City must honor the commitment made in the Close Rikers plan to adequately fund and open 380 more beds immediately. The Council should also ensure funding is available to develop 500 additional new JISH beds per year for the next five years. Provide $46 million in additional funding for Rapid Reentry Housing, which provides immediate, temporary housing to people released from Rikers Island through MOCJ hotel contracts. This successful model provides barrier-free, stable housing and tailored onsite services, including mental health services and job placement assistance, to eliminate lack of housing as an impediment to release and directly reduce incarceration in New York City. 3. EXPEDITE CASE PROCESSING On average, people held pretrial at Rikers have been incarcerated for 280 days and counting. This keeps them and crime victims waiting for answers and accountability. The Mayor, Council, and other system actors must take action to speed up case processing to ensure people are not stuck on Rikers for months or years while they await trial and are presumed innocent. Increase funding for the City‚Äôs indigent defense legal services organizations by $135 million to allow for higher salaries that enable greater staff retention and more seamless case oversight. The high rates of turnover among defenders contributes to case delays, so this will allow people to have their cases resolved more quickly. Create an oversight system to hold DOC accountable for getting people on time to 100% of court dates . Prior to the pandemic, DOC got people to court on time 96% of the time. Currently, only 72% of people are on time. Urge OCA and DOC to maximize videoconferencing to facilitate appearances in court, including ensuring there are video booths easily accessible from each housing unit. DOC must also commit to getting people to 100% of video court appearances and ensure they can connect privately with their attorneys before appearances. Ensure the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has adequate staff and resources to eliminate delays in testing DNA and other evidence . Fund more paralegals and state-of-the-art technology to help district attorneys and public defenders implement discovery laws to facilitate required exchange of evidence. Ensure Correctional Health Services has the resources necessary to speed up 730 exams, which determine whether someone is mentally competent to stand trial by replicating and expanding successful pilots . Request that New York State and NYC Health+Hospitals provide additional hospital beds for people found incompetent, so that the ~400 people annually determined not to be competent to stand trial no longer languish at Rikers. Regularly convene key stakeholders from OCA to improve coordination between the City and judges to shorten case processing timelines . Call on the Mayor to¬†make all available judicial appointments expeditiously in order to ensure case delays are not due to court capacity issues. CONCLUSION Beyond getting the City on track to close Rikers by 2027, these investments and legislation will create a safer, more just New York, and provide stability, support, and care to vulnerable people and our communities.

Increase Supervised Release program funding by $28 million (to a total of $100 million) and work with relevant stakeholders, including District Attorneys, Defenders, and the Office of Court Administration, to establish and build support for a more intensive supervised release model that connects people to mental health care, substance use, and other resources.

Longer term, the Council should consider allocating funds for a fully staffed and resourced Pretrial Services Agency to manage this program. Enhance funding for Alternative to Incarceration (ATI) Programs and Alternative to Detention Programs (ATD) by $34 million . Half the nearly 6,000 people on Rikers Island have a mental health diagnosis. The city must fund ATI programs to levels adequate to meet the needs of this population, connecting people to the services they need rather than jail, and seek to address gaps in the current network to work with people facing a broader range of charges and higher levels of need.

Urge the Adams administration to accelerate the construction of outposted therapeutic housing beds at Bellevue, Woodhull, and North Central Bronx . These are secure hospital beds that would be used for the most ill people currently at Rikers. The City has already allocated capital funds for 380 therapeutic beds and has the staff available to operate them ‚Äînow the Administration must follow through and bring them online as soon as possible. The sooner that happens, the sooner these people can avoid Rikers. In parallel, the City should fund additional therapeutic beds and invest in increased capacity to expand the population targeted for therapeutic beds, including people with mental illness.

Reports should include anticipated resources required to reduce the jail population below 3,600. 2. EXPAND ACCESS TO HOUSING People experiencing homelessness need homes, not jail, but New York City incarcerates roughly 2,600 unhoused people whose behavioral needs should qualify them for supportive housing - permanent affordable housing with wrap-around services. Often, judges are reluctant to release people without homes, and the likelihood of rearrest is higher among people facing housing instability. To advance safety and justice, New York City must increase funding and access to housing options that connect vulnerable people with stable places to live and the services they need to thrive. Pass legislation or take executive action to amend the homeless eligibility requirement for the NYC 15/15 supportive housing program to include time in jail as time considered homeless . If a person enters jail or prison homeless, their time incarcerated should count towards being homeless. Currently incarceration does not count towards homeless eligibility criteria and much like shelters, jails and prisons are not meant for permanent or ongoing habitation. The 15/15 program also needs an additional $45 million investment to support rental subsidy increases and higher services rates to fill and operate the remaining units.

Increase funding for Justice Involved Supportive Housing (JISH) by $26 million to serve more people with the highest jail and shelter use who have mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Although JISH has been proven effective, only 120 beds exist ‚Äì and even those are inadequately funded. The City must honor the commitment made in the Close Rikers plan to adequately fund and open 380 more beds immediately. The Council should also ensure funding is available to develop 500 additional new JISH beds per year for the next five years.

Provide $46 million in additional funding for Rapid Reentry Housing, which provides immediate, temporary housing to people released from Rikers Island through MOCJ hotel contracts. This successful model provides barrier-free, stable housing and tailored onsite services, including mental health services and job placement assistance, to eliminate lack of housing as an impediment to release and directly reduce incarceration in New York City.

EXPEDITE CASE PROCESSING On average, people held pretrial at Rikers have been incarcerated for 280 days and counting. This keeps them and crime victims waiting for answers and accountability. The Mayor, Council, and other system actors must take action to speed up case processing to ensure people are not stuck on Rikers for months or years while they await trial and are presumed innocent. Increase funding for the City‚Äôs indigent defense legal services organizations by $135 million to allow for higher salaries that enable greater staff retention and more seamless case oversight. The high rates of turnover among defenders contributes to case delays, so this will allow people to have their cases resolved more quickly.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Air Quality Resource Guide Wildfire smoke from fires in Canada has been causing New Yorkers to experience poor air quality during the summer of 2023. Western states have been dealing with poor air quality from wildfires for years, but this is new for New Yorkers and there is a lot for us to learn to stay safe. As these events are likely to become more frequent, we‚Äôve put together the best government resources to help answer frequently asked questions. We are also continuing to advocate for the City to share clear and timely information when future poor air quality events occur. What is the Air Quality Index (AQI)? What level is bad? The New York State Department of Environmental protection explains: ‚ÄúThe AQI is a scale used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI correlates levels of different pollutants to one scale. The higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.‚Äù The scale ranges from 0 to 500. An AQI above 100 is ‚ÄúUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups.‚ÄùAt an AQI of 150 and higher, everyone may begin to experience health effects, members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. You can see the full scale and learn more about the index from the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation. Where can I check the Air Quality Index (AQI)? Air Now provides the current AQI level. Many phones also include air quality data in their weather applications. The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation provides air quality forecasts. Air quality is hard to predict and can vary significantly throughout the day. While wildfire smoke events are happening, please be aware that even if the air quality is within normal range in the morning, it can become unhealthy later in the day. How can I get alerts about poor air quality? You can sign up for Notify NYC Alerts or call 311. Notify NYC sends out alerts when the Air Quality Index is expected to be above 100 (‚ÄúUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups‚Äù) or higher. You can also sign up for customized daily air quality reports with Enviro Flash . What should I do to protect myself when there is poor air quality? Poor air quality can have significant health impacts, especially for children, older adults, and people with preexisting conditions. You should limit the time you spend outside when air quality is unhealthy. It is important to stay hydrated and monitor children and older adults for any symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and watery eyes. The NYC Department of Health has also provided additional guidance for child care programs, schools, and camps. Masks : High-quality (N95 or KN95 masks) can also reduce exposure to air pollution when worn correctly, but do not protect against all impacts. While cloth or surgical masks do provide protection from coronavirus, they provide negligible protection against wildfire pollutants. The Department of Health has provided the following recommendations for outdoor activity based on the AQI level : What can we do to help the air quality? While poor air quality in the summer of 2023 has largely been caused by smoke from wildfires in Canada, there are steps we can all take to reduce our own emissions and help to improve air quality locally. Some easy actions include choosing a cleaner commute by taking the subway or carpooling, complying with the City‚Äôs car idling law, and reducing your energy usage at home or work by lowering your AC and electricity usage. These are also all excellent choices we can make to play a role in tackling the climate crisis. Our office is working on legislation to mandate the City of New York to take aggressive policy actions to reduce emissions during hazardous air quality incidents. What are the health impacts? Exposure to wildfire smoke has been shown to lead to a variety of health effects. According to the EPA, the health effects of particle pollution exposure from wildfire smoke can range from relatively minor (e.g., eye and respiratory tract irritation) to more serious health effects (e.g., exacerbation of asthma and heart failure, and premature death). There are limited studies on the long term health effects of wildfire smoke exposure. You should consult with a medical professional about any concerns you have. Source . What should I do to protect the air inside my apartment/home? When air quality is poor, you should keep your windows closed. There are steps you can take to improve your indoor air quality, such as avoiding the following activities: using gas stoves, vacuuming, burning candles, smoking cigarettes, and spraying aerosol products. The EPA has more advice. It is also important to learn how to properly adjust your air conditioning or HVAC system to keep smoke out of your home. Learn more! Air purifiers or air cleaners can also be used to filter indoor air. The EPA has more information on factors to consider when deciding to purchase an air cleaner, and advice on how to make a DIY air cleaner.
