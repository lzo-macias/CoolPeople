New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room Wake Up, Mayor Adams: NYC Public Advocate Calls on Mayor to Release Involuntary Transport Data, Follow the Law April 24th, 2025 Press Release New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams urged the administration to release data on the outcomes of NYPD involuntary transports today, as the mayor and others push to expand the involuntary commitment of New Yorkers. While data was made available for the 661 clinician-initiated transports in 2024, no corresponding number is public for the 7060 initiated by the NYPD. The Public Advocate also released the following statement: “Wake up, Mayor Adams. The unintended consequences of passing this proposal to lowering standards could be dire, and lead to the criminalization of poverty, homelessness, and how it presents itself in our city. We have to be focused on helping people, not hiding them. If the mayor is committed to that goal, the least he can do is show us the data. Despite what the mayor and governor say, the choice is not between doing nothing and doing the wrong thing.” The Public Advocate sent a letter to the NYPD requesting this essential data be made public as the administration continues to double down on a strategy without showing evidence of its effectiveness and despite evidence to the contrary. He also held a press conference today to amplify this call, to ask that the mayor follow the existing law before pushing for new, harmful ones, and to highlight the need to strengthen and sustain support for New Yorkers in the greatest need.

A copy of the letter is below. April 24, 2025 Dear Commissioner Tisch, I recently wrote to Mayor Adams to express deep concern about the administration’s push to expand the use of involuntary commitment laws rather than following existing laws designed to support New Yorkers in need. A January report to the City Council [ 2024 Involuntary Transports Annual Report ] from the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health tracked involuntary transports across city agencies in 2024. According to that report, the NYPD initiated 7,060 of these transports. In that communication, I raised a critical and still unaddressed issue: The data provided shows that clinician-initiated transports—661 in total—resulted in hospital admissions 58% of the time. However, there is no comparable data regarding the outcomes of the NYPD-initiated transports. What were the outcomes of the 7,060 individuals transported to hospitals by the NYPD? This information is not just a matter of public transparency—it is essential for policymaking. As conversations continue in Albany around potentially expanding the use of involuntary commitment through the state budget, we must have a clear, data-driven understanding of how these transports are currently being used, and with what outcomes. Without that, we risk shaping policy without fully grasping its real-world implications. My office is requesting this information from the department, and urges you to release the data publicly to engage in good-faith collaboration with oversight bodies and community stakeholders to ensure practices align with public health priorities, civil liberties, and accountability. Please direct follow-up correspondence to my office through Chief Deputy Public Advocate for Policy Veronica Aveis at vaveis@advocate.nyc.gov . Sincerely,

Jumaane D. Williams

No. 416 Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.3103-B/A.6058-A, to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Restler, Cabán and Hanif Whereas, Incarcerated individuals are housed in jails and prisons where they experience overcrowding, solitary confinement, routine exposure to violence, and mental trauma while disconnected from support systems such as family, friends, and other communities; and Whereas, According to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit organization advocating against mass criminalization, exposure of incarcerated individuals to violence and other common conditions in jails and prisons can exacerbate their existing mental health disorders and lead to their development of post-traumatic stress symptoms such as anxiety, depression, hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, suicidality, flashbacks, and difficulty with emotional regulation; and Whereas, The Prison Policy Initiative theorizes that incarceration can lead to post-incarceration syndrome, a syndrome similar to post-traumatic stress disorder whereby individuals continue to suffer mental health effects related to their incarceration after serving their official sentences; and Whereas, The Urban Institute, a non-profit research organization advocating for upward mobility and equity, posits that women are the fastest-growing incarcerated population in the United States and that many will experience violence, abuse, and trauma during their term of incarceration; and Whereas, According to a study conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice and Black and Pink National from 2019 to 2022 involving transgender individuals incarcerated in state prisons, transgender people are especially at risk for contact with the criminal justice system and half of the individuals surveyed reported that their mental health deteriorated during their period of incarceration; and Whereas, The Vera Institute of Justice argues that resources and treatment options within jails and prisons to help incarcerated individuals manage their mental health after release are woefully inadequate, even though according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services more than 600,000 incarcerated individuals are released from state and federal prisons each year while another 9 million incarcerated individuals cycle through local jails; and Whereas, The Prison Policy Initiative reported in 2022, based on a survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the United States Department of Justice in 2016, that over 50 percent of individuals incarcerated in state prisons reported mental health problems but only 26 percent of these individuals received mental health treatment since entering prison; and Whereas, The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) manages two prisons within New York City, Edgecombe Residential Treatment Facility in Manhattan and Queensboro Correctional Facility in Long Island City; and Whereas, S.3103-B, introduced by New York State Senator Jabari Brisport and pending in the New York State Senate, and A.6058-A, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Michaelle C. Solages and pending in the New York State Assembly, seek to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals in DOCCS custody with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration, in part involving inclusion by DOCCS of mental health reentry services in the transitional accountability plan for each person within DOCCS custody and provision by DOCCS of supportive services for incarcerated individuals upon release who received trauma intervention while in DOCCS custody; and Whereas, The New York City Council believes that the provision of adequate mental health services to individuals who have endured the traumas of incarceration is essential during and after incarceration, particularly supporting S.3103-B/A.6058-A because there are incarcerated individuals in DOCCS custody residing in state prisons located within New York City; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.3103-B/A.6058-A, to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration.

No. 333-A Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S. 28A /A. 1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Brannan, Louis, Rivera and Banks Whereas, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a Federal law that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local government; and Whereas, To prevent employers from not hiring certain individuals based on certain characteristics, such as being a student learner or having a disability, including disabilities related to age and injury, the FLSA provides for the employment of such individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum, if an employer is issued a subminimum wage certificate by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the United States Department of Labor; and Whereas, Although the intent of the FLSA is to prevent certain workers from not receiving a job, as employers may not hire these workers if regular minimum wage laws applied, certain workers have nevertheless been unfairly treated and paid fractions of what others are paid; and Whereas, The FLSA impacts individuals with disabilities in particular, as section 14(c) of the law authorizes employers that have been issued a subminimum wage certificate to pay subminimum wages to workers who have physical or mental disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, that may affect earning or productive capacity for the job being performed; and Whereas, Wages paid by these employers are required to be commensurate with a disabled workers’ individual productivity as compared to the wage and productivity of workers who do not have disabilities performing the same type, quality, and quantity of work, but some argue that these standards are arbitrary and, oftentimes, may be skewed by an employer looking to cut costs; and Whereas, This means that workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, can be paid significantly less than other workers if an employer shows that the worker with disabilities is not as productive or efficient; and Whereas, Notably, there have been a number of instances of this happening to an extreme, including in 2013, when NBC News reported that GoodWill Industries paid their workers with disabilities as little as 22 cents an hour, and in 2018, when Vox Media reported an Illinois nonprofit paid workers with disabilities in gift cards; and Whereas , According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of May 1, 2024, 801 employers across 38 states paid subminimum wages to 40,579 workers, and a 2022-2023 report by the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations found that approximately 1,400 individuals in New York State were paid subminimum wages; and Whereas, Thus, as a result of a legal loophole in the FLSA, individuals with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, are being undervalued and unfairly compensated by employers; and Whereas, In order to ensure that these workers are protected in New York State, S. 28-A/A. 1006 have been introduced in the New York State Legislature; and Whereas, S. 28A, introduced by State Senator James Skoufis, and A.1006, introduced by State Assembly Member Phil Steck, would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age; and Whereas, This legislation would have a large impact on New York State and New York City, as both have a significant population of individuals with disabilities, with the New York State Department of Health estimating that 1 in 4 or 27% of adults in New York State have some type of disability, and the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities estimating that roughly 11% of the City’s total population have some type of disability; and Whereas, Due to the large number of individuals with disabilities, and New York State’s General Municipal Law requiring that all public bidding for contracts be awarded to the lowest possible bidder, there is incentive for employers in New York State to reduce costs and thus, contract bids, by applying for a subminimum wage certificate and paying workers with disabilities a subminimum wage; and Whereas, S. 28-A /A. 1006 would ensure that New York State workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, receive the pay they deserve and are treated fairly; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S. 28A /A. 1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age.

No. 333-A   Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S. 28A /A. 1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age. Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.  28A /A.  1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age.   By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Brannan, Louis, Rivera and Banks By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Brannan, Louis, Rivera and Banks   Whereas, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a Federal law that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local government; and  Whereas, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a Federal law that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local government; and Whereas, To prevent employers from not hiring certain individuals based on certain characteristics, such as being a student learner or having a disability, including disabilities related to age and injury, the FLSA provides for the employment of such individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum, if an employer is issued a subminimum wage certificate by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the United States Department of Labor; and  Whereas, To prevent employers from not hiring certain individuals based on certain characteristics, such as being a student learner or having a disability, including disabilities related to age and injury, the FLSA provides for the employment of such individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum, if an employer is issued a subminimum wage certificate by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the United States Department of Labor; and Whereas, Although the intent of the FLSA is to prevent certain workers from not receiving a job, as employers may not hire these workers if regular minimum wage laws applied, certain workers have nevertheless been unfairly treated and paid fractions of what others are paid; and  Whereas, Although the intent of the FLSA is to prevent certain workers from not receiving a job, as employers may not hire these workers if regular minimum wage laws applied, certain workers have nevertheless been unfairly treated and paid fractions of what others are paid; and Whereas, The FLSA impacts individuals with disabilities in particular, as section 14(c) of the law authorizes employers that have been issued a subminimum wage certificate to pay subminimum wages to workers who have physical or mental disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, that may affect earning or productive capacity for the job being performed; and  Whereas, The FLSA impacts individuals with disabilities in particular, as section 14(c) of the law authorizes employers that have been issued a subminimum wage certificate to pay subminimum wages to workers who have physical or mental disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, that may affect earning or productive capacity for the job being performed; and Whereas, Wages paid by these employers are required to be commensurate with a disabled workers’ individual productivity as compared to the wage and productivity of workers who do not have disabilities performing the same type, quality, and quantity of work, but some argue that these standards are arbitrary and, oftentimes, may be skewed by an employer looking to cut costs; and  Whereas, Wages paid by these employers are required to be commensurate with a disabled workers’ individual productivity as compared to the wage and productivity of workers who do not have disabilities performing the same type, quality, and quantity of work, but some argue that these standards are arbitrary and, oftentimes, may be skewed by an employer looking to cut costs; and Whereas, This means that workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, can be paid significantly less than other workers if an employer shows that the worker with disabilities is not as productive or efficient; and  Whereas, This means that workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, can be paid significantly less than other workers if an employer shows that the worker with disabilities is not as productive or efficient; and Whereas, Notably, there have been a number of instances of this happening to an extreme, including in 2013, when NBC News reported that GoodWill Industries paid their workers with disabilities as little as 22 cents an hour, and in 2018, when Vox Media reported an Illinois nonprofit paid workers with disabilities in gift cards;

and Whereas , According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of May 1, 2024, 801 employers across 38 states paid subminimum wages to 40,579 workers, and a 2022-2023 report by the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations found that approximately 1,400 individuals in New York State were paid subminimum wages;

and Whereas, Thus, as a result of a legal loophole in the FLSA, individuals with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, are being undervalued and unfairly compensated by employers; and  Whereas, Thus, as a result of a legal loophole in the FLSA, individuals with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, are being undervalued and unfairly compensated by employers; and Whereas, In order to ensure that these workers are protected in New York State, S. 28-A/A. 1006 have been introduced in the New York State Legislature; and  Whereas, In order to ensure that these workers are protected in New York State, S.  28-A/A.  1006 have been introduced in the New York State Legislature; and Whereas, S. 28A, introduced by State Senator James Skoufis, and A.1006, introduced by State Assembly Member Phil Steck, would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age; and Whereas, S. 28A, introduced by State Senator James Skoufis, and A.1006, introduced by State Assembly Member Phil Steck, would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age; and Whereas, This legislation would have a large impact on New York State and New York City, as both have a significant population of individuals with disabilities, with the New York State Department of Health estimating that 1 in 4 or 27% of adults in New York State have some type of disability, and the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities estimating that roughly 11% of the City’s total population have some type of disability;

and Whereas, Due to the large number of individuals with disabilities, and New York State’s General Municipal Law requiring that all public bidding for contracts be awarded to the lowest possible bidder, there is incentive for employers in New York State to reduce costs and thus, contract bids, by applying for a subminimum wage certificate and paying workers with disabilities a subminimum wage;

No. 245 Resolution calling on the United States Senate to pass and the President to sign the Women’s Health Protection Act By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Cabán, Hanif, Louis, Narcisse, Avilés, Joseph, Farías, Ossé, De La Rosa, Dinowitz, Marte, Krishnan, Ayala, Sanchez, Lee, Won, Powers, Richardson Jordan and The Speaker (Council Member Adams) Whereas, A citizen’s rights to make decisions about their own bodies, their families, and their lives are basic human rights; and Whereas, Reproductive rights and abortion services are essential health care and the cornerstone of a sound public health system; and Whereas, Ensuring access to abortion care is central to the pursuit of reproductive justice; and Whereas, According to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 1 in 4 women in America will have an abortion by age 45; and Whereas, The 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade was a landmark decision in which the Court ruled that a person may choose to have an abortion until a fetus becomes viable (usually between 24 and 28 weeks after conception), based on the right to privacy contained in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and Whereas, Nonetheless, access to abortion services has been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities, restrictions on insurance coverage, medically unnecessary regulations and many more that neither confer any health benefit nor further the safety of abortion services; and Whereas, According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 500 state laws restricting abortion have been enacted since 2011, nearly 90 percent of American counties are without a single abortion provider and five states are down to their last abortion clinic; and Whereas, The harms of abortion restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low-income, immigrants, women of color, those in the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and other marginalized or multi-marginalized groups; and Whereas, According to a study by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), individuals who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy are more likely to experience intimate partner violence, health problems, poverty, and ongoing financial distress and eviction than those who are able to access wanted abortion care; and Whereas, With a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggesting that Roe v. Wade is on the brink of being overturned in the highest court in the land, it is essential to enshrine the right to abortion access into federal law; and Whereas, S.1975, sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, and H.R. 3755, sponsored by Representative Judy Chu, also known as the Women Health Protection Act (WHPA), would protect the federal right to abortion and would block the barrage of state bans and restrictions on abortion intended to impede or outright deny access; and Whereas, The House of Representatives passed WHPA on September 24, 2021, yet the Senate has failed to move forward with the bill; and Whereas, WHPA would protect a person’s freedom to make decisions about their own reproductive health care and a health care provider’s ability to provide the full range of reproductive health services, including abortion; and Whereas, Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people regardless of race, color, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, age, or disability status, have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities; now, therefore, be it Resolved That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Senate to pass and the President to sign the Women’s Health Protection Act .

Type: Introduction Status: Enacted Committee: Committee on Civil and Human Rights On agenda: 12/20/2018 Enactment date: 1/10/2021 Law number: 2021/004 Title: A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting discrimination based on one's arrest record, pending criminal accusations or criminal convictions Sponsors: Public Advocate Jumaane Williams , Adrienne E. Adams , Brad S. Lander , Daniel Dromm , Helen K. Rosenthal , Ben Kallos , Carlos Menchaca , Antonio Reynoso , Diana I. Ayala , James G. Van Bramer , Carlina Rivera , (by request of the Mayor) Council Member Sponsors: 11 Summary: This bill would extend employment protections for individuals with pending adjournments in contemplation of dismissal (ACDs) and convictions for violations prior to sealing by adding unsealed violations and ACDs to the category of dispositions that may never be considered for the purpose of making employment-related decisions. The bill also prohibits discrimination in licensing against applicants with convictions for violations, even prior to sealing. Additionally, this bill would clarify protections for applicants and employees with pending criminal cases by explicitly requiring an employer to make an individualized assessment of the relationship between the charged conduct and the job, much like what is required for consideration of an individual’s conviction history.

The results of a medical exam as permitted by the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §12112; or 3. Other information the employer could not have reasonably known before making the conditional offer if the employer can show as an affirmative defense that, based on the information, it would not have made the offer regardless of the results of the criminal background check.

The bill also prohibits discrimination in licensing against applicants with convictions for violations, even prior to sealing. Additionally, this bill would clarify protections for applicants and employees with pending criminal cases by explicitly requiring an employer to make an individualized assessment of the relationship between the charged conduct and the job, much like what is required for consideration of an individual’s conviction history.

No. 41 Resolution calling on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation that allows service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to use the United States Department of Veteran Affairs home loans to purchase cooperative apartments. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Hanif, Yeger, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Dinowitz, Menin and Holden Whereas, The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) helps service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to become homeowners by offering a home loan; and Whereas, Home loans offered by the VA, known as VA loans, are provided by private lenders such as banks and mortgage companies; and Whereas, The VA guarantees a portion of the home loan, which enables the lender to provide favorable terms; and Whereas, The New York Times published an article titled, “A Loan Program for Veterans Comes Wrapped in Red Tape”, on June 10, 2013, which identified obstacles to using the VA loan to purchase a condominium or cooperative apartment in New York; and Whereas, The New York Times article highlights three challenges: 1) New York real estate firms have no experience with VA loans, 2) VA loans can only be used to purchase a condominium if the entire building applies to the VA for approval and 3) cooperative buildings are excluded from the VA loan program; and Whereas, According to the National Association of Housing Cooperatives,  more than 1.2 million families in the United States live in homes owned and operated through a cooperative association and most of these units are located in major urban areas such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York City; and Whereas, Cooperative units are often a less expensive housing option when compared to condominium units or single-family houses; and Whereas, Veterans seeking to find a home in New York City or other major urban areas should have similar home buying support as veterans who purchase homes in suburban or rural areas; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation that allows service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to use the United States Department of Veteran Affairs home loans to purchase cooperative apartments.

No. 415-A Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2240/A.5414, which would remove the lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons and postpone jury service for any person currently incarcerated for a felony By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Restler, Cabán, Hanif, Joseph, Banks, Louis and Rivera Whereas, Pursuant to section 510 of the New York State Judiciary Law, individuals convicted of felonies are permanently disqualified from serving on a jury within the New York State Unified Court System, including courts in New York City, regardless of the seriousness of the felony or how long ago it occurred, resulting in jury disenfranchisement; and Whereas, There are constitutional bases for the responsibility of serving on a jury, such as the right to a trial by jury enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in section 2 of article I of the New York State Constitution; and Whereas, Jury service provides an opportunity for citizens to participate in the process of governing by giving them a voice in the justice system; and Whereas, Section 509 of the New York State Judiciary Law requires individualized screening of all prospective jurors to determine their qualification for jury service in the New York State Unified Court System; and Whereas, New York State law does not impose a ban on jury service relating to conduct that bears more directly than the commission of a felony on fitness to participate in a jury, like tampering with a juror in the first degree, which is a misdemeanor pursuant to section 215.25 of the New York State Penal Law; and Whereas, New York State’s lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons has a disproportionate impact on minorities, as according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2022, for example, in New York State, 45 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 51 percent of prison sentences involved Black individuals, compared to just 25 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 28 percent of prison sentences involving White individuals; and Whereas, The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the National Center for Health Statistics also reported that in 2022 in New York City, Black individuals were involved in 52 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 61 percent of prison sentences, compared to White individuals who accounted for only 9 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 5 percent of prison sentences; and Whereas, The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), a not-for-profit organization focused on advancing civil rights for New Yorkers, filed a lawsuit in December 2022 challenging the exclusion of convicted felons from Manhattan jury service and reported that between 2002 and 2019, Black individuals in Manhattan were convicted of felonies at a rate more than 21 times greater than the felony conviction rate for White individuals; and Whereas, The NYCLU additionally found in connection with filing such lawsuit that approximately 25 percent of Manhattan’s Black residents, which is approximately 38,000 people, would be otherwise eligible to serve on a jury but are instead disqualified due to a prior felony conviction; and Whereas, It is essential for New York City to safeguard its residents’ ability to participate in civic society and make the justice system fairer by reducing jury disenfranchisement that has a disproportionate impact on Black individuals in New York City, through advocating for removal of the New York State legislative ban on jury service on the basis of a previous felony conviction; and Whereas, S.2240, introduced by New York State Senator Cordell Cleare and pending in the New York State Senate, and A.5414, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Edward Gibbs and pending in the New York State Assembly, seek to remove such ban and postpone the jury service of any person serving a term of incarceration for a felony during the period of such incarceration; and Whereas, In May 2021, former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law S.830-B/A.4448-A, to grant voting rights to formerly incarcerated individuals convicted of a felony, and the enactment of S.2240/A.5414 would be a logical next step in promoting justice and the rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals after release from custody; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2240/A.5414, which would remove the lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons and postpone jury service for any person currently incarcerated for a felony.

Our Solutions for Addressing Maternal Health Disparities Latest Press April 22nd, 2025 Press Release April 22nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Mayor's Lies on Immigration “For months, the mayor has lied to New Yorkers about what sanctuary cities are, claiming it is impossible to advance public safety under our current sanctuary laws. Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It seems that the real joint effort between the mayor and the White House is to lie about public safety for political gain, demonize immigrants, and weaponize fear to justify the worst of their actions.” Get Help!

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room April 24th, 2025 Press Release April 24th, 2025 Press Release Wake Up, Mayor Adams: NYC Public Advocate Calls on Mayor to Release Involuntary Transport Data, Follow the Law New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams urged the administration to release data on the outcomes of NYPD involuntary transports today, as the mayor and others push to expand the involuntary commitment of New Yorkers. While data was made available for the 661 clinician-initiated transports in 2024, no corresponding number is public for the 7060 initiated by the NYPD. The Public Advocate also released the following statement: “Wake up, Mayor Adams. The unintended consequences of passing this proposal to lowering standards could be dire, and lead to the criminalization of poverty, homelessness, and how it presents itself in our city. We have to be focused on helping people, not hiding them. If the mayor is committed to that goal, the least he can do is show us the data. Despite what the mayor and governor say, the choice is not between doing nothing and doing the wrong thing.” The Public Advocate sent a letter to the NYPD requesting this essential data be made public as the administration continues to double down on a strategy without showing evidence of its effectiveness and despite evidence to the contrary. He also held a press conference today to amplify this call, to ask that the mayor follow the existing law before pushing for new, harmful ones, and to highlight the need to strengthen and sustain support for New Yorkers in the greatest need.

A copy of the letter is below. April 24, 2025 Dear Commissioner Tisch, I recently wrote to Mayor Adams to express deep concern about the administration’s push to expand the use of involuntary commitment laws rather than following existing laws designed to support New Yorkers in need. A January report to the City Council [ 2024 Involuntary Transports Annual Report ] from the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health tracked involuntary transports across city agencies in 2024. According to that report, the NYPD initiated 7,060 of these transports. In that communication, I raised a critical and still unaddressed issue: The data provided shows that clinician-initiated transports—661 in total—resulted in hospital admissions 58% of the time. However, there is no comparable data regarding the outcomes of the NYPD-initiated transports. What were the outcomes of the 7,060 individuals transported to hospitals by the NYPD? This information is not just a matter of public transparency—it is essential for policymaking. As conversations continue in Albany around potentially expanding the use of involuntary commitment through the state budget, we must have a clear, data-driven understanding of how these transports are currently being used, and with what outcomes. Without that, we risk shaping policy without fully grasping its real-world implications. My office is requesting this information from the department, and urges you to release the data publicly to engage in good-faith collaboration with oversight bodies and community stakeholders to ensure practices align with public health priorities, civil liberties, and accountability. Please direct follow-up correspondence to my office through Chief Deputy Public Advocate for Policy Veronica Aveis at vaveis@advocate.nyc.gov . Sincerely,

Jumaane D. Williams
Public Advocate for the City of New York April 22nd, 2025 Press Release April 22nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Mayor's Lies on Immigration “For months, the mayor has lied to New Yorkers about what sanctuary cities are, claiming it is impossible to advance public safety under our current sanctuary laws. Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It seems that the real joint effort between the mayor and the White House is to lie about public safety for political gain, demonize immigrants, and weaponize fear to justify the worst of their actions.” April 21st, 2025 Press Release April 21st, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate's Statement on the Passing of Pope Francis "I join in mourning the loss of Pope Francis, who led one billion Catholics and was a model of faithful, loving service for many more, regardless of creed. "I was privileged to see him speak during his visit to our city, where his humility was palpable and his message memorable. Through his life, his leadership, and into his final days he put his faith forward through his words and works, seeking to lift up the people pushed to the margins of society. Like Jesus, peace be unto his name, he was a passionate voice for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, the sick, the imprisoned, the immigrant, the outsider. He brought mercy and love from the pulpit into the world. "It is my hope and fervent prayer that we extend his legacy by continuing the path he walked, working as he did for progress, for inclusivity, for understanding, for true and lasting peace and justice." April 21st, 2025 Press Release April 21st, 2025 Press Release IN CASE HE MISSED IT: NYC Public Advocate Renews Call for Mayor to Follow Public Safety Laws that Support New Yorkers in Need Last week, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams called for the city and state to make use of mental health incident review panels, following the laws in place rather than pushing for new ones which could do more harm than good. Comments from the mayor over the weekend appear to make it clear that the mayor did not understand the request or the law, so the Public Advocate issued the following statement in response. “I have to assume that the mayor did not understand the practice or purpose of mental health incident review panels – it is the only explanation for his response. I know that this mayor has a long history of ignoring laws (and the truth) when not politically beneficial to him, but it is negligent of him not to use all the tools available to help people in need before demanding new, harmful ones. These panels – which again, have never been used despite over a decade of the state law –  are intended to review circumstances, address missteps, and prevent future harm. This isn’t solely about individual incidents like last week’s shooting –it's about understanding how one gets to the point of crisis. To suggest that it is not helpful to trace the cause of mental health incidents is like arguing against autopsies because they can’t prevent the death that took place. “We have to examine the spaces where people get left behind in order to make the changes that will actually help people get the services they need and protect public health and safety. The mayor has never used the power to request this review. Willful ignorance is not an option – either of the gaps in our systems which allow New Yorkers in need to suffer, or of the laws on books to help correct them.” Under Mental Hygiene Law § 31.37 , the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health has the power to establish a mental health incident review panel, either by their own initiative or at the request of a local government unit following a serious incident involving a person with mental illness. However, as affirmed in a February 5 hearing in Albany, these panels have never been requested. The Public Advocate sent letters to both City Hall and Albany, questioning the mayor on why the city has not asked for these reviews in the past and asking the state’s mental health commissioner to convene one for a recent incident.

April 20th, 2025 Press Release April 20th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate's Statement on the Celebration of Easter "Happy Easter to all Christians celebrating the resurrection this morning in the city and around the world. My family and I join this celebration and amplify Jesus Christ’s powerful message of righteousness and redemption that can be applied to our own lives thousands of years later. "The story of Holy Week that culminates in Easter Sunday is one of an immigrant refugee, of revolutionary leader who sought to free the oppressed and persecuted, was targeted by a frightened, tyrannical regime because of his message, was imprisoned and killed, but ultimately emerged triumphant. The death and resurrection of Jesus is a story we can identify with and ultimately draw hope from today. "Easter evokes themes of rebirth, of rising from sorrow and looking toward joy. The example of Jesus’ bold call for justice and willingness to suffer asks us to stand up for those who cannot, to humble ourselves, even to undergo sacrifice for the good of others. "Driven by the joy of the work we do for one another, the conviction that we are on the right side of history and morality, and the hope of what we can achieve, I wish all who celebrate a blessed and joyful Easter." April 18th, 2025 Press Release April 18th, 2025 Press Release Williams Asks State, Mayor To Use Public Health And Safety Tools They Have, Not Demand Harmful Laws As the governor and mayor delay the budget in order to involuntarily commit more New Yorkers, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams is questioning why they refuse to use tools they already have available. Under a decade-old law, the state has the ability to convene mental health incident review panels in the event of certain encounters involving individuals in a mental health crisis. These panels, intended to identify systemic failures and ensure services are adequately rendered, can be convened following a request from a municipality, but have never been used. Under Mental Hygiene Law § 31.37 , the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health has the power to establish a mental health incident review panel, either by their own initiative or at the request of a local government unit following a serious incident involving a person with mental illness. However, as affirmed in a February 5 hearing in Albany, these panels have never been requested. The Public Advocate sent letters to both City Hall and Albany , questioning the mayor on why the city has not asked for these reviews in the past and asking the state’s mental health commissioner to convene one for a recent incident in Queens involving an individual in mental health crisis. “Monday's incident in Queens presents us with a clear example to review if any gaps in services contributed to this tragic loss of life,” Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams wrote in his request to the state. “...People with mental illness are far more likely to be the victim of a crime than to perpetrate one, and we must be careful that the state itself is not persecuting this vulnerable population who need services, not detention. Convening a panel now would mean we actually are serious about doing all we can to prevent incidents like this from taking place. ” This request comes as the state considers language to broaden the ability of law enforcement and other government actors to engage with and involuntarily commit people perceived as unable to meet their basic needs due to their mental health, an overly-expansive definition which threatens to criminalize homelessness, mental health issues, and poverty without providing meaningful aid. Rather than adopting this ineffective and harmful tool, the state can utilize the panels and implement the recommendations put forward by a state task force recommending a health-centered approach. The Public Advocate also questioned the mayor’s approach, saying in a letter “Often we see from your administration a rush to respond in the immediate aftermath of tragedy or crisis with more officers and fewer civil liberties. From homelessness to mental illness, your administration’s solution is police presence often budgetarily at the expense of the services aimed at preventing tragedies such as this." Read the letters to city and state leaders here. “As leaders, we are duty bound to use the resources we have at our disposal to protect individuals with serious mental illnesses. With mechanisms for transparency and accountability in place, like incident review panels, we can lessen the gaps in our mental health delivery system to enhance the safety of individuals and our larger community. By drawing upon the recommendations from incident review panels, we can address the broader failures in our mental health systems and services to ensure that fewer individuals in crisis fall through the cracks and receive the dignity and care they deserve,” said State Senator Samra G. Brouk, Chair of the Senate Mental Health Committee. "Too often, tragedies point to gaps in our mental health system. Incident review panels are a woefully underutilized tool that can reveal systemic gaps in the continuum of care and inform policy makers how to improve treatment. By doing so, we will improve accountability and safety. When an incident occurs, we too often find out the individual had been previously involuntarily hospitalized. If expanding involuntary commitment were the answer, such incidents would not happen post discharge. We should focus on proactive, collaborative, and evidence-based solutions to the problems presented. Convening an incident review panel would show a commitment to learning from this tragedy and preventing future harm. I’m grateful to Public Advocate Williams for elevating this important resource and calling for action," Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, Mental Health Committee Chair . “Connecting our most vulnerable New Yorkers to a full continuum of care including supportive housing and the clubhouse model, will ensure individuals are placed on the path to recovery and rehabilitation,” said Council Member Linda Lee , Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addiction . “The Administration has continuously relied on involuntary removals as a catch-all solution without providing funding for the necessary treatment measures for people in need of long-term services. The City Council previously passed my legislation to provide data on the Administration’s involuntary removal directive to provide our city the crucial insight for policy creation for our most vulnerable communities. I remain committed to working with my City and State colleagues to create better solutions for New Yorkers experiencing severe mental illness.” Search Media Inquiries: Categories: All Press Release Statement Our Office David N.

Williams Office of the New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams View all 54 employees View all 54 employees Report this company About us The public advocate is a non-voting member of the New York City Council with the right to introduce and co-sponsor legislation. Prior to a 2002 charter revision, the Public Advocate was also the presiding officer of the Council. The public advocate also serves as an ombudsman for city government, providing oversight for city agencies, investigating citizens' complaints about city services and making proposals to address perceived shortcomings or failures of those services. These duties, worded somewhat ambiguously, are laid out in Section 24 of the City Charter. The public advocate serves on the committee which selects the director of the New York City Independent Budget Office and appoints members to several boards and commissions, including one member of the New York City Planning Commission. The public advocate also serves as chair of the Commission of Public Information and Communication established by Section 1061 of the New York City Charter. Along with the Mayor and the Comptroller, the public advocate is one of three municipal offices elected by all the city's voters. In the event of a vacancy or incapacity of the mayor, the public advocate is first in line to become mayor.

It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person engaged in any activity to which this chapter applies to retaliate or discriminate in any manner against any person because such person has (i) opposed any practice forbidden under this chapter, (ii) filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under this chapter, (iii) commenced a civil action alleging the commission of an act which would be an unlawful discriminatory practice under this chapter, (iv) assisted the commission or the corporation counsel in an investigation commenced pursuant to this title, (v) requested a reasonable accommodation under this chapter, or ([v] vi ) provided any information to the commission pursuant to the terms of a conciliation agreement made pursuant to section 8-115 of this chapter. The retaliation or discrimination complained of under this subdivision need not result in an ultimate action with respect to employment, housing or a public accommodation or in a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment, housing, or a public accommodation, provided, however, that the retaliatory or discriminatory act or acts complained of must be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity. § 2.

No. 641 Resolution calling on the coordination of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), the New York State Office of Court Administration, and New York City District Attorneys to expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Levin, Cumbo, Ayala, Lander, Kallos, Treyger, Rivera and Miller Whereas, In recent years many jurisdictions around the country have sought to correct the wrongs of the war on drugs and collateral consequences of marijuana-related convictions; and Whereas, In New York City, enforcement policies have been amended to move further away from criminalizing the low-level possession and use of marijuana; and Whereas, As of September 2018, the New York City Police Department committed to issuing criminal summons in lieu of arrests for the majority of persons found smoking marijuana in public; and Whereas, Arrests will only be made if persons are on probation or parole, have an existing criminal warrant, a recent history of violence, does not possess a form of identification, or if their smoking poses an immediate public safety risk, such as while driving a car; and Whereas, While the City has taken steps to improve enforcement, a legacy of unduly harsh policies has had significantly negative adverse consequences on those with convictions for marijuana possession, hindering access to housing, education, and employment prospects for persons with decades-old convictions; and Whereas, Due to racial disparities in policing strategies, research shows that poor communities of color are disproportionately affected by marijuana convictions; and Whereas, According to the Misdemeanor Project at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, between 1993 and 2016, arrestees for marijuana-related charges were overwhelmingly Black and Latino men, despite there being no difference in usage across race; and Whereas, As many states have now legalized marijuana for recreational use, some jurisdictions, including San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle have automatically cleared prior misdemeanor convictions for possession; and Whereas, New York should follow in the footsteps of these jurisdictions; therefore be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the coordination of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), the New York State Office of Court Administration, and New York City District Attorneys to expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions LS 7034/7208 10/18/2018 CMA Legislation Text Legislation Details Legislation Details (With Text) Details Details Details Details Reports Reports Reports Reports File #: File #: Res 0641-2018 Version: * Res 0641-2018 Version: * Name: Name: Expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions.

Silenced Crisis: Black Maternal Mortality and the Birthing Center Solution April 17th, 2025 This report focuses on the benefits of birthing centers and midwifery-led practices  throughout the childbirth process, from prenatal to postpartum. It details the dangers and barriers that lead to high rates of maternal mortality, as well as efforts the city and state can take to better support maternal health. Our office is calings for a birthing center to be available in every borough, and focused on the importance of access to often-overlooked resources such as midwifery care – before, during, and after birth. Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries December 23rd, 2024 This report comes during the 2024 Holiday Season—a time when the influx of visitors and cold weather exerts more stress on the city’s electric grid and prompts an increase in delivery services. In addition to the surge in business, it is likely that the holiday season will also correspond with a surge in purchased e-bikes, which may be sold through discounted prices and holiday deals. "Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries," emphasizes the key policy recommendations that will mitigate this issue, allowing for a market that safely and responsibly benefits from this growing technology. Welcoming Our Newest New Yorkers: A Review February 29th, 2024 In the summer of 2022, the first bus of people seeking asylum at the southern border arrived in our city. Since then, the Office of the Public Advocate has worked to be on the ground in this effort, both welcoming and supporting migrants and asylum seekers directly and in our advocacy to the state and federal government. This review documents some of those efforts over the last year and a half, and attempts to chart a course for the next phase of the effort to provide support and safety to people in dire need, upholding both our governing and moral mandate. Out of Service: Creating an Equitable Transit System for New York City November 1st, 2023 This report seeks to outline the inequities disabled New Yorkers experience while using public transit in New York City and recommend how the city can make this system fully accessible and inclusive. It is, simply put, the right thing to do: people with disabilities have the same right to fully access city services as people without disabilities. The law also increasingly demands that barriers to full integration and engagement in public life be remedied and addressed. Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC July 11th, 2023 Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC finds shortcomings in the city’s response to the air quality emergency, and particularly with the speed and scope of public notification and harm mitigation efforts. It notes that while some alerts about potential air quality concerns were available in the days prior to the worst of the crisis, the information about health risks was neither comprehensive nor circulated widely. Additionally, measures such as the postponing of outdoor activities and the shift to remote education were announced long after the crisis was underway, rather than sufficiently in advance or shortly after the crisis started, given the warnings and risk. Improving New York City’s Responses To Individuals In Mental Health Crisis: 2022 Update November 16th, 2022 In October of 2019, the Office of the Public Advocate released "Improving New York City’s Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis,” a report outlining the state of mental health response in the city and a guide for restructuring and reforming those systems. Now in 2022, it is time to see how the City has fared in implementing our recommendations and start the conversation on further changes that are needed. Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety For New York City September 12th, 2022 Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety In New York City focuses on the numerous factors that are correlated to the increasing number of shootings in New York City. The recommendations are divided by each level of government: effective tactics from other municipalities outside of New York, the public safety 2.0 platform previously released by this office, and existing legislations at the city, state and federal level. How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing September 1st, 2022 How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing shows the striking evidence of unresolved issues that impact the lives of NYCHA residents everyday. The report focuses on various problems that all five NYCHA developments face. Towards the end of the report, our office provides recommendations that we urge are taken into consideration. Committee To End Homelessness By The Year 2026 July 28th, 2022 In winter 2020, there were nearly 80,000 people unhoused in New York City, the highest number in the city’s history. This situation is an unnecessary tragedy, and is the result of an economic system that does not support the needs of the general population of New York City residents. The system as it exists today is inhumane, flawed, wasteful, and self-perpetuating. Redefining Public Safety 2.0: Gun Violence Updates May 20th, 2022 Gun violence in our communities is a public health crisis that has been exacerbated amid the compounding public health crisis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, New York City had worked over the previous decade to bring levels of violence to historic lows, in part due to a slow transition toward holistic, community centered solutions. Disrupting The Exploitation Economy: A White Paper On Protecting Workers Classified As Independent Contractors April 21st, 2022 Independent contractors face multiple issues, from wage theft to misclassification, in their jobs. As this industry grows, risks remain for these workers. Elected officials must offer assistance and protections for these workers in light of their challenges. White Paper 2.0: Invest In Education February 17th, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic sent New York City into an unprecedented crisis, with a unique impact on students, families, educators, and school staff. Students have struggled, experienced trauma and isolation, and had their learning disrupted. As students go back to school, the city has an opportunity and a duty to ensure that its schools are equitable, safe, and supportive for every student. Reviewing The Mayor’s Housing Plan To Bolster Affordability And Equity December 3rd, 2021 When Mayor Bill De Blasio released his comprehensive housing report in 2014, I expressed my disapproval during my tenure as a Council Member, as I knew it did not go far enough. Following the Mayor’s Housing 2.0 plan, my opinion remained the same. White Paper: Equitable Pregnancy Outcomes For  Black And Brown New Yorkers November 10th, 2021 The maternal health crisis in the United States disproportionately impacts Black, and Indigenous pregnant persons, with stark disparities at the local level in New York City. This problem has significantly affected Black women, who have been more likely to die during childbirth than white women for more than a century. Why New York City Needs A Racial Equity Report To Be Part Of The Land Rezoning Process June 16th, 2021 In 1968, the Fair Housing Act was passed to protect people from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. If a person is renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities, they are protected from discrimination because of this federal law. A Renewed Deal For New York City March 11th, 2021 COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the inequities that have long plagued New York City. When we break down the data demographically, we see that while all New Yorkers have been impacted in some way, those coming from traditionally marginalized communities have been hit the hardest. White Paper: On Reimagining School Safety February 25th, 2021 The Office of the Public Advocate sees a vision for schools and community safety that centers New York City’s children and families—schools that heal and address trauma, and center on de-escalation and supportive resources. We know the main drivers of safety in communities are access to quality and well-resourced education, healthcare, and housing. Schools need to address the ways those are accessed to reimagine public safety in our schools. White Paper: In The Event Of A Second Wave November 5th, 2020 When the first reported case of COVID-19 appeared in New York, action was taken too slowly, and in some cases did not go far enough. Knowing little about how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted, how it manifested in people, and how to protect communities, New York City and New York State were slow to enforce a shutdown. A lack of preparation for an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic led to an almost immediate shortage of medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not advise all Americans to wear face masks or coverings until April.

No. 296 Resolution calling on the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth and fifth degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses,” and stop considering these offenses as grounds for termination of tenancy. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Ampry-Samuel, Reynoso, Lander, Kallos, Rivera, Ayala and Miller Whereas, Scientific and medical studies have shown that marijuana is less harmful than legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco; and Whereas, A 2015 study published in Scientific Reports found that marijuana is 114 times less deadly than alcohol; and Whereas, That study also found that marijuana presented the lowest mortality risk of the drugs it examined, which also included tobacco, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, and methamphetamines; and Whereas, Marijuana has a well-documented history of health benefits; and Whereas, In January of 2017, the United States National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a report that analyzed more than 10,000 studies and found strong evidence that marijuana lessened chronic pain in adults as well as various side effects of multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy; and Whereas, Moreover, experimentation with cannabis has become common in the United States; and Whereas, A Marist poll released in January found that 52 percent of American adults have tried marijuana and that 56 percent believed the drug to be “socially acceptable;” and Whereas, Even though cannabis poses no unique harms, offers medical benefits, and has been used by millions, prospective residents of public housing in New York City can face up to three years of ineligibility if they are convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession, under federal law and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations; and Whereas, These directives also burden the relatives of those who have been convicted, as NYCHA can deny admission to family members of individuals convicted of Class A or B misdemeanors; and Whereas, In recent years, both federal and local agencies have sought to mitigate these collateral consequences; and Whereas, In June of 2011, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan advised executive directors of public housing authorities across the country to consider “second chances,” and examine “all factors that might suggest favorable future conduct” in reviewing applications from potential tenants; and Whereas, In November of 2014, the New York Police Department (NYPD) announced that it would stop arresting those found to be in possession of up to 25 grams of marijuana, and begin issuing court summonses and fines instead; and Whereas, It is worth noting that New York is one of sixteen states that does not ban individuals from receiving public assistance due to a prior drug conviction; and Whereas, New York state law still treats possession of marijuana in a public place, which can include transportation facilities, parks, and places of amusement, as a crime, for which one can spend as many as three months in jail; and Whereas, This means that an applicant for public housing who was found in possession of a small amount of marijuana in a public park, a class B misdemeanor, could not only spend time in jail but also make his or her family ineligible for public housing for three years; and Whereas, NYCHA has the discretion to determine which offenses it overlooks and which it considers for prospective applicants; and Whereas, In accordance with existing medical consensus, and consistent with prior federal and local policy shifts, adding fourth and fifth degree marijuana possession to NYCHA’s list of overlooked offenses would not only preserve access to public housing for thousands but also prevent families from adverse circumstances in the event of a minor drug infraction; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon NYCHA to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth and fifth degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses,” and stop considering these offenses as grounds for termination of tenancy MK LS# 9704/Res.1784/2017 LS # 690 1/2/18 Legislation Text Legislation Details Legislation Details (With Text) Details Details Details Details Reports Reports Reports Reports File #: File #: Res 0296-2018 Version: * Res 0296-2018 Version: * Name: Name: NYCHA to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the 4th & 5th degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses.

Our Solutions for Addressing Maternal Health Disparities Latest Press April 22nd, 2025 Press Release April 22nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Mayor's Lies on Immigration “For months, the mayor has lied to New Yorkers about what sanctuary cities are, claiming it is impossible to advance public safety under our current sanctuary laws. Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It seems that the real joint effort between the mayor and the White House is to lie about public safety for political gain, demonize immigrants, and weaponize fear to justify the worst of their actions.” Get Help!

Rosenthal in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill, S.568, introduced by State Senator Brian Kavanagh in the New York State Senate, would require the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to implement a rental assistance program in the form of housing vouchers, known as the Housing Access Voucher Program, for eligible individuals and families who are homeless or are on the verge of losing their home; and Whereas, A.4021/S.568A, would create a pathway for people who are homeless and reduce the number of people without housing in New York State; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.4021/S.568A, in relation to establishing a housing access voucher program JLC/AS LS 4754, 8287 3/29/2023 Legislation Text Legislation Details Legislation Details (With Text) Details Details Details Details Reports Reports Reports Reports File #: File #: Res 0344-2022 Version: * A Res 0344-2022 Version: Name: Name: Establishing a housing access voucher program.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room NYC Public Advocate Defends Immigrant Communities At Hearing After Mayor Refuses To Before Congress March 6th, 2025 Press Release After Mayor Adams failed to defend vulnerable New Yorkers from lies and hate while testifying before Congress on Wednesday, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams spoke out in defense of immigrant communities. At a budget hearing of the City Council’s Committee on Immigration, the Public Advocate called for a rejection of false narratives and support for key services for our city of immigrants, regardless of when one arrived in New York. “I would like to make one thing very clear,” declared Public Advocate Williams. “The funding of services for our newest New Yorkers has been wielded by our mayor and now the President as a political weapon that seeks to distort a simple reality: even in the face of the billions of dollars the city has spent on asylum seeker services, this number pales in comparison to the cost of Trump’s immigration agenda… The answer is simple. The resources we devote to our most vulnerable New Yorkers is a fraction of the cost of what the Mayor-President, sorry, the mayor AND president, are proposing.” The Public Advocate emphasized both the moral and legal right to fund housing – and to maintain baseline capacity for this shelter infrastructure even after some emergency shelters have closed as the number of arrivals ebbs. He also emphasized the importance of legal services, saying “During times of heightened exclusion, federally-sponsored racism, and scapegoating, our lawyers are our frontline workers. They deserve to have funding that is adequate and flexible enough to make sure that long term legal care for individuals in need can be funded.” “To the detriment of our city and its goods and services, the Mayor has continuously overbudgeted for asylum seeker services, and often make cuts to city goods and services based on that…” continued the Public Advocate. “... His tactics to scapegoat our vulnerable communities and manufacture a fraudulent picture of the use of tax payer dollars is both regrettable and misleading. This is the same overbudgeting scheme that blames the closure of libraries, crucial programs, and now childcare facilities on our newest New Yorkers. In fact, we should be blaming the Mayor.” Read the Public Advocate’s full comments below. Video is available here. STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS
TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON
IMMIGRATION
MARCH 6, 2025 Thank you very much Madame Chair. As mentioned, My name is Jumaane D. Williams and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. Thank you very much Chair Aviles for holding today’s hearing and allowing me the opportunity to provide a statement. First I just want to say the mayor was in D.C. yesterday. I think he’s now a national embarrassment, as he had the opportunity to step up and lead but became the face of capitulation. I’m saying that, not you. But I want to make sure that you know that we understand that we don’t have the mayor that we need at this moment in time. So I just want to thank the Commissioner, Director, and hopefully, you’ll continue to do what you can, under some very difficult circumstances. But also I think there are some things the City Council is asking that can help that go a little easier. I just wanted to acknowledge that you’re working under a mayor that I think has oppositional views to most of us, including yourselves, and I acknowledge that. In advance of the discussions being held at today’s hearing, I would like to make one thing very clear. The funding of services for our newest New Yorkers has been wielded by our mayor and now the President as a political weapon that seeks to distort a simple reality: even in the face of the billions of dollars the city has spent on asylum seeker services, this number pales in comparison to the cost of Trump’s immigration agenda. For everyone who might object to the expenditure of city and state resources to welcome our newest New Yorkers, please think about the cost of chartered planes, or private detention facilities, and of ever-expanding law enforcement. Thank you for the contributions that our immigrant communities make to our city’s economy and what a loss of labor, goods, and tax dollars will cost our city. Just to be clear, seeking asylum is perfectly legal in this country, at least it is today. The answer is simple. The resources we devote to our most vulnerable New Yorkers is a fraction of the cost of what the Mayor-President, sorry, the mayor AND president, are proposing. The conservative estimate put forth by pro-Trump think tanks estimates the national cost at $500 billion, more than two-hundred times the cost of our city’s budget this year. In fact, peer-reviewed economists have predicted that the true cost of Trump’s immigration agenda, combined with the loss of labor and tax payer dollars, is over $6 trillion. To the detriment of our city and its goods and services, the Mayor has continuously overbudgeted for asylum seeker services, and often make cuts to city goods and services based on that. You will hear him boast about saving more than $2 billion dollars in this year’s budget. This is money that was allocated for asylum seekers and never properly spent, yet, the Mayor is still insisting that we require more State funds for these operations. His tactics to scapegoat our vulnerable communities and manufacture a fraudulent picture of the use of tax payer dollars is both regrettable and misleading. This is the same overbudgeting scheme that blames the closure of libraries, crucial programs, and now childcare facilities on our newest New Yorkers. In fact, we should be blaming the Mayor. And I do want to have a message to long-term New Yorkers who have not gotten what they needed and they’ve been here for decades and decades. I just want to be clear that the money that has been spent thus far has always been here. We have always had the money to provide everything that everyone needed. Please do not allow people who chose not to spend that money on people who were in crisis long before the migrants were here to now blame the migrants for decisions that they haven’t made. As the number of asylum seekers in our shelters continues to decrease, we must now become intentional about retaining our baseline of necessary asylum seeking services while also addressing the increased danger being imposed on our communities. We must ensure that NYC’s Department of Homeless Services can fill the void left by closing emergency facilities for those still in need of shelter. Besides housing - which I believe is a right and not an optional service - the most critical lifeline for our non-citizen communities are our rapid legal services, something that the city should have paid attention to a long time ago, and we would have had some folks here seeking asylum legally have more ability to work. I am calling on the Mayor and the Council to answer the call of the Rapid Response Legal Collaborative for an additional $33 million, just over $11 million per organization. During times of heightened exclusion, federally-sponsored racism, and scapegoating, our lawyers are our frontline workers. They deserve to have funding that is adequate and flexible enough to make sure that long term legal care for individuals in need can be funded. New York City is, and always will be, a city of immigrants. I focused my testimony today mostly on asylum seekers and migrants as they are at heightened risk, but we are a city of immigrants, all immigrants, and newest New Yorkers are no different from our city’s many grandparents and great-grandparents who landed on Ellis Island. We have a fiduciary responsibility as public servants, family members, and humans to continue to care for our vulnerable communities and that means putting our money where our heart is – and to be clear this was never about criminals or crimes. Sanctuary cities are safer than other cities, and we already have laws that help deal with people who are convicted of particular crimes. It was never about being legal  or illegal. They are now turning people over who were here legally like Haitian brothers and sisters, our Venezuelan brothers and sisters, who were here legally on TPS taking away that status and sometimes always left out, Black immigrants are the highest percentage to be deported based on their presence here and once again we see anti-Blackness rear its head. Lastly, I just want to remind folks that the mayor himself practically dared people to send the buses here, saying that he’d be able to handle the problem. So I’m just very disappointed with where we are, but I’m thankful to the chair, the Speaker, to this City Council and for so many others trying to stand in the gap where this mayor is not. And I’m thankful to the public servants who are doing the best they can in some very difficult situations. With that, I yield back Thank you so much.

Lastly, I just want to remind folks that the mayor himself practically dared people to send the buses here, saying that he’d be able to handle the problem. So I’m just very disappointed with where we are, but I’m thankful to the chair, the Speaker, to this City Council and for so many others trying to stand in the gap where this mayor is not. And I’m thankful to the public servants who are doing the best they can in some very difficult situations. With that, I yield back Thank you so much.

meet jumaane THE PEOPLE’S ADVOCATE.  Jumaane Williams has served as New York City’s Public Advocate since 2019. Since becoming Public Advocate, the second-highest ranking office in New York City, Jumaane has restructured the office to empower staff to prioritize community engagement, outreach, and service. He has also passed more legislation in office than all previous Public Advocates combined, including key bills that protect New Yorkers in the workplace and those looking for work, shield struggling homeowners from undue tax burdens, increase public safety, and fight discrimination in our housing systems. Prior to serving as Public Advocate, he represented Brooklyn’s 45th District in the New York City Council from 2009-2019. Jumaane is a first-generation Brooklynite of Grenadian heritage. He was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome and ADHD as a teenager, persevering as he came up through the public school system from pre-school to Master’s. After graduating, Jumaane began his career as a community organizer by serving as the assistant director for the Greater Flatbush Beacon School, then later as the executive director of New York State Tenants & Neighbors, where he fought for truly affordable, income targeted housing across the city and state. In 2009, he defeated an incumbent to begin his career as an activist elected official in the New York City Council. During his time at City Hall, Jumaane has championed landmark legislation to create transformational change. In his first term, Jumaane aimed to end the abuse of the NYPD’s use of stop, question and frisk by sponsoring the Community Safety Act. The legislation was enacted despite a veto from then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and helped put an end to unlawful policing practices typically used in communities of more color, while creating the NYPD’s Office of Inspector General to investigate unlawful or unethical practices within the department. As Co-Chair of the Council’s Task Force to Combat Gun Violence, he helped launch New York’s Crisis Management System, which funds Cure Violence Groups that work to reduce shootings through a multi-pronged, community-centered approach. As Chairman of the Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, he challenged the de Blasio administration’s inadequate affordable housing plan by advocating for more deeply affordable housing to help prevent communities from being priced out of the five boroughs.. Throughout his over decade of service in government, Jumaane never stopped standing with marginalized communities to fight for justice and equity for all, and has never been afraid to put his body on the line. He has been arrested more than any other sitting elected official in New York, standing up for women’s rights, immigration rights, housing rights, and more.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room April 24th, 2025 Press Release April 24th, 2025 Press Release Wake Up, Mayor Adams: NYC Public Advocate Calls on Mayor to Release Involuntary Transport Data, Follow the Law New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams urged the administration to release data on the outcomes of NYPD involuntary transports today, as the mayor and others push to expand the involuntary commitment of New Yorkers. While data was made available for the 661 clinician-initiated transports in 2024, no corresponding number is public for the 7060 initiated by the NYPD. The Public Advocate also released the following statement: “Wake up, Mayor Adams. The unintended consequences of passing this proposal to lowering standards could be dire, and lead to the criminalization of poverty, homelessness, and how it presents itself in our city. We have to be focused on helping people, not hiding them. If the mayor is committed to that goal, the least he can do is show us the data. Despite what the mayor and governor say, the choice is not between doing nothing and doing the wrong thing.” The Public Advocate sent a letter to the NYPD requesting this essential data be made public as the administration continues to double down on a strategy without showing evidence of its effectiveness and despite evidence to the contrary. He also held a press conference today to amplify this call, to ask that the mayor follow the existing law before pushing for new, harmful ones, and to highlight the need to strengthen and sustain support for New Yorkers in the greatest need.

A copy of the letter is below. April 24, 2025 Dear Commissioner Tisch, I recently wrote to Mayor Adams to express deep concern about the administration’s push to expand the use of involuntary commitment laws rather than following existing laws designed to support New Yorkers in need. A January report to the City Council [ 2024 Involuntary Transports Annual Report ] from the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health tracked involuntary transports across city agencies in 2024. According to that report, the NYPD initiated 7,060 of these transports. In that communication, I raised a critical and still unaddressed issue: The data provided shows that clinician-initiated transports—661 in total—resulted in hospital admissions 58% of the time. However, there is no comparable data regarding the outcomes of the NYPD-initiated transports. What were the outcomes of the 7,060 individuals transported to hospitals by the NYPD? This information is not just a matter of public transparency—it is essential for policymaking. As conversations continue in Albany around potentially expanding the use of involuntary commitment through the state budget, we must have a clear, data-driven understanding of how these transports are currently being used, and with what outcomes. Without that, we risk shaping policy without fully grasping its real-world implications. My office is requesting this information from the department, and urges you to release the data publicly to engage in good-faith collaboration with oversight bodies and community stakeholders to ensure practices align with public health priorities, civil liberties, and accountability. Please direct follow-up correspondence to my office through Chief Deputy Public Advocate for Policy Veronica Aveis at vaveis@advocate.nyc.gov . Sincerely,

Jumaane D. Williams
Public Advocate for the City of New York April 22nd, 2025 Press Release April 22nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Mayor's Lies on Immigration “For months, the mayor has lied to New Yorkers about what sanctuary cities are, claiming it is impossible to advance public safety under our current sanctuary laws. Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It seems that the real joint effort between the mayor and the White House is to lie about public safety for political gain, demonize immigrants, and weaponize fear to justify the worst of their actions.” April 21st, 2025 Press Release April 21st, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate's Statement on the Passing of Pope Francis "I join in mourning the loss of Pope Francis, who led one billion Catholics and was a model of faithful, loving service for many more, regardless of creed. "I was privileged to see him speak during his visit to our city, where his humility was palpable and his message memorable. Through his life, his leadership, and into his final days he put his faith forward through his words and works, seeking to lift up the people pushed to the margins of society. Like Jesus, peace be unto his name, he was a passionate voice for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, the sick, the imprisoned, the immigrant, the outsider. He brought mercy and love from the pulpit into the world. "It is my hope and fervent prayer that we extend his legacy by continuing the path he walked, working as he did for progress, for inclusivity, for understanding, for true and lasting peace and justice." April 21st, 2025 Press Release April 21st, 2025 Press Release IN CASE HE MISSED IT: NYC Public Advocate Renews Call for Mayor to Follow Public Safety Laws that Support New Yorkers in Need Last week, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams called for the city and state to make use of mental health incident review panels, following the laws in place rather than pushing for new ones which could do more harm than good. Comments from the mayor over the weekend appear to make it clear that the mayor did not understand the request or the law, so the Public Advocate issued the following statement in response. “I have to assume that the mayor did not understand the practice or purpose of mental health incident review panels – it is the only explanation for his response. I know that this mayor has a long history of ignoring laws (and the truth) when not politically beneficial to him, but it is negligent of him not to use all the tools available to help people in need before demanding new, harmful ones. These panels – which again, have never been used despite over a decade of the state law –  are intended to review circumstances, address missteps, and prevent future harm. This isn’t solely about individual incidents like last week’s shooting –it's about understanding how one gets to the point of crisis. To suggest that it is not helpful to trace the cause of mental health incidents is like arguing against autopsies because they can’t prevent the death that took place. “We have to examine the spaces where people get left behind in order to make the changes that will actually help people get the services they need and protect public health and safety. The mayor has never used the power to request this review. Willful ignorance is not an option – either of the gaps in our systems which allow New Yorkers in need to suffer, or of the laws on books to help correct them.” Under Mental Hygiene Law § 31.37 , the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health has the power to establish a mental health incident review panel, either by their own initiative or at the request of a local government unit following a serious incident involving a person with mental illness. However, as affirmed in a February 5 hearing in Albany, these panels have never been requested. The Public Advocate sent letters to both City Hall and Albany, questioning the mayor on why the city has not asked for these reviews in the past and asking the state’s mental health commissioner to convene one for a recent incident.

April 20th, 2025 Press Release April 20th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate's Statement on the Celebration of Easter "Happy Easter to all Christians celebrating the resurrection this morning in the city and around the world. My family and I join this celebration and amplify Jesus Christ’s powerful message of righteousness and redemption that can be applied to our own lives thousands of years later. "The story of Holy Week that culminates in Easter Sunday is one of an immigrant refugee, of revolutionary leader who sought to free the oppressed and persecuted, was targeted by a frightened, tyrannical regime because of his message, was imprisoned and killed, but ultimately emerged triumphant. The death and resurrection of Jesus is a story we can identify with and ultimately draw hope from today. "Easter evokes themes of rebirth, of rising from sorrow and looking toward joy. The example of Jesus’ bold call for justice and willingness to suffer asks us to stand up for those who cannot, to humble ourselves, even to undergo sacrifice for the good of others. "Driven by the joy of the work we do for one another, the conviction that we are on the right side of history and morality, and the hope of what we can achieve, I wish all who celebrate a blessed and joyful Easter." April 18th, 2025 Press Release April 18th, 2025 Press Release Williams Asks State, Mayor To Use Public Health And Safety Tools They Have, Not Demand Harmful Laws As the governor and mayor delay the budget in order to involuntarily commit more New Yorkers, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams is questioning why they refuse to use tools they already have available. Under a decade-old law, the state has the ability to convene mental health incident review panels in the event of certain encounters involving individuals in a mental health crisis. These panels, intended to identify systemic failures and ensure services are adequately rendered, can be convened following a request from a municipality, but have never been used. Under Mental Hygiene Law § 31.37 , the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health has the power to establish a mental health incident review panel, either by their own initiative or at the request of a local government unit following a serious incident involving a person with mental illness. However, as affirmed in a February 5 hearing in Albany, these panels have never been requested. The Public Advocate sent letters to both City Hall and Albany , questioning the mayor on why the city has not asked for these reviews in the past and asking the state’s mental health commissioner to convene one for a recent incident in Queens involving an individual in mental health crisis. “Monday's incident in Queens presents us with a clear example to review if any gaps in services contributed to this tragic loss of life,” Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams wrote in his request to the state. “...People with mental illness are far more likely to be the victim of a crime than to perpetrate one, and we must be careful that the state itself is not persecuting this vulnerable population who need services, not detention. Convening a panel now would mean we actually are serious about doing all we can to prevent incidents like this from taking place. ” This request comes as the state considers language to broaden the ability of law enforcement and other government actors to engage with and involuntarily commit people perceived as unable to meet their basic needs due to their mental health, an overly-expansive definition which threatens to criminalize homelessness, mental health issues, and poverty without providing meaningful aid. Rather than adopting this ineffective and harmful tool, the state can utilize the panels and implement the recommendations put forward by a state task force recommending a health-centered approach. The Public Advocate also questioned the mayor’s approach, saying in a letter “Often we see from your administration a rush to respond in the immediate aftermath of tragedy or crisis with more officers and fewer civil liberties. From homelessness to mental illness, your administration’s solution is police presence often budgetarily at the expense of the services aimed at preventing tragedies such as this." Read the letters to city and state leaders here. “As leaders, we are duty bound to use the resources we have at our disposal to protect individuals with serious mental illnesses. With mechanisms for transparency and accountability in place, like incident review panels, we can lessen the gaps in our mental health delivery system to enhance the safety of individuals and our larger community. By drawing upon the recommendations from incident review panels, we can address the broader failures in our mental health systems and services to ensure that fewer individuals in crisis fall through the cracks and receive the dignity and care they deserve,” said State Senator Samra G. Brouk, Chair of the Senate Mental Health Committee. "Too often, tragedies point to gaps in our mental health system. Incident review panels are a woefully underutilized tool that can reveal systemic gaps in the continuum of care and inform policy makers how to improve treatment. By doing so, we will improve accountability and safety. When an incident occurs, we too often find out the individual had been previously involuntarily hospitalized. If expanding involuntary commitment were the answer, such incidents would not happen post discharge. We should focus on proactive, collaborative, and evidence-based solutions to the problems presented. Convening an incident review panel would show a commitment to learning from this tragedy and preventing future harm. I’m grateful to Public Advocate Williams for elevating this important resource and calling for action," Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, Mental Health Committee Chair . “Connecting our most vulnerable New Yorkers to a full continuum of care including supportive housing and the clubhouse model, will ensure individuals are placed on the path to recovery and rehabilitation,” said Council Member Linda Lee , Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addiction . “The Administration has continuously relied on involuntary removals as a catch-all solution without providing funding for the necessary treatment measures for people in need of long-term services. The City Council previously passed my legislation to provide data on the Administration’s involuntary removal directive to provide our city the crucial insight for policy creation for our most vulnerable communities. I remain committed to working with my City and State colleagues to create better solutions for New Yorkers experiencing severe mental illness.” Search Media Inquiries: Categories: All Press Release Statement Our Office David N.

Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

On January 5, 2025, after a decades long fight by street safety, public transit, and environmental advocates, New York City put into place a new policy designed to raise funds for public transit improvements, decrease pollution, and incentivize greener modes of transportation. January 3rd, 2025 | Housing & Health Equity What Is Bird Flu and How to Protect Yourself People can get infected if body fluids from an animal with bird flu get into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or are breathed in. Farm workers, backyard bird owners, and wild bird handlers may be at higher risk of getting bird flu.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Reports The Policy Department is responsible for developing progressive policy recommendations for city-wide issues such as pay equity, education, and affordable housing. The department monitors and evaluates the services of city agencies and forms actionable solutions to improve their functioning for the benefit of all New Yorkers. The Policy Department is responsible for developing progressive policy recommendations for city-wide issues such as pay equity, education, and affordable housing. The department monitors and evaluates the services of city agencies and forms actionable solutions to improve their functioning for the benefit of all New Yorkers. Silenced Crisis: Black Maternal Mortality and the Birthing Center Solution April 17th, 2025 This report focuses on the benefits of birthing centers and midwifery-led practices  throughout the childbirth process, from prenatal to postpartum. It details the dangers and barriers that lead to high rates of maternal mortality, as well as efforts the city and state can take to better support maternal health. Our office is calings for a birthing center to be available in every borough, and focused on the importance of access to often-overlooked resources such as midwifery care – before, during, and after birth. Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries December 23rd, 2024 This report comes during the 2024 Holiday Season—a time when the influx of visitors and cold weather exerts more stress on the city’s electric grid and prompts an increase in delivery services. In addition to the surge in business, it is likely that the holiday season will also correspond with a surge in purchased e-bikes, which may be sold through discounted prices and holiday deals. "Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries," emphasizes the key policy recommendations that will mitigate this issue, allowing for a market that safely and responsibly benefits from this growing technology. Welcoming Our Newest New Yorkers: A Review February 29th, 2024 In the summer of 2022, the first bus of people seeking asylum at the southern border arrived in our city. Since then, the Office of the Public Advocate has worked to be on the ground in this effort, both welcoming and supporting migrants and asylum seekers directly and in our advocacy to the state and federal government. This review documents some of those efforts over the last year and a half, and attempts to chart a course for the next phase of the effort to provide support and safety to people in dire need, upholding both our governing and moral mandate. Out of Service: Creating an Equitable Transit System for New York City November 1st, 2023 This report seeks to outline the inequities disabled New Yorkers experience while using public transit in New York City and recommend how the city can make this system fully accessible and inclusive. It is, simply put, the right thing to do: people with disabilities have the same right to fully access city services as people without disabilities. The law also increasingly demands that barriers to full integration and engagement in public life be remedied and addressed. Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC July 11th, 2023 Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC finds shortcomings in the city’s response to the air quality emergency, and particularly with the speed and scope of public notification and harm mitigation efforts. It notes that while some alerts about potential air quality concerns were available in the days prior to the worst of the crisis, the information about health risks was neither comprehensive nor circulated widely. Additionally, measures such as the postponing of outdoor activities and the shift to remote education were announced long after the crisis was underway, rather than sufficiently in advance or shortly after the crisis started, given the warnings and risk. Improving New York City’s Responses To Individuals In Mental Health Crisis: 2022 Update November 16th, 2022 In October of 2019, the Office of the Public Advocate released "Improving New York City’s Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis,” a report outlining the state of mental health response in the city and a guide for restructuring and reforming those systems. Now in 2022, it is time to see how the City has fared in implementing our recommendations and start the conversation on further changes that are needed. Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety For New York City September 12th, 2022 Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety In New York City focuses on the numerous factors that are correlated to the increasing number of shootings in New York City. The recommendations are divided by each level of government: effective tactics from other municipalities outside of New York, the public safety 2.0 platform previously released by this office, and existing legislations at the city, state and federal level. How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing September 1st, 2022 How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing shows the striking evidence of unresolved issues that impact the lives of NYCHA residents everyday. The report focuses on various problems that all five NYCHA developments face. Towards the end of the report, our office provides recommendations that we urge are taken into consideration. Committee To End Homelessness By The Year 2026 July 28th, 2022 In winter 2020, there were nearly 80,000 people unhoused in New York City, the highest number in the city’s history. This situation is an unnecessary tragedy, and is the result of an economic system that does not support the needs of the general population of New York City residents. The system as it exists today is inhumane, flawed, wasteful, and self-perpetuating. Redefining Public Safety 2.0: Gun Violence Updates May 20th, 2022 Gun violence in our communities is a public health crisis that has been exacerbated amid the compounding public health crisis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, New York City had worked over the previous decade to bring levels of violence to historic lows, in part due to a slow transition toward holistic, community centered solutions. Disrupting The Exploitation Economy: A White Paper On Protecting Workers Classified As Independent Contractors April 21st, 2022 Independent contractors face multiple issues, from wage theft to misclassification, in their jobs. As this industry grows, risks remain for these workers. Elected officials must offer assistance and protections for these workers in light of their challenges. White Paper 2.0: Invest In Education February 17th, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic sent New York City into an unprecedented crisis, with a unique impact on students, families, educators, and school staff. Students have struggled, experienced trauma and isolation, and had their learning disrupted. As students go back to school, the city has an opportunity and a duty to ensure that its schools are equitable, safe, and supportive for every student. Reviewing The Mayor’s Housing Plan To Bolster Affordability And Equity December 3rd, 2021 When Mayor Bill De Blasio released his comprehensive housing report in 2014, I expressed my disapproval during my tenure as a Council Member, as I knew it did not go far enough. Following the Mayor’s Housing 2.0 plan, my opinion remained the same. White Paper: Equitable Pregnancy Outcomes For  Black And Brown New Yorkers November 10th, 2021 The maternal health crisis in the United States disproportionately impacts Black, and Indigenous pregnant persons, with stark disparities at the local level in New York City. This problem has significantly affected Black women, who have been more likely to die during childbirth than white women for more than a century. Why New York City Needs A Racial Equity Report To Be Part Of The Land Rezoning Process June 16th, 2021 In 1968, the Fair Housing Act was passed to protect people from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. If a person is renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities, they are protected from discrimination because of this federal law. A Renewed Deal For New York City March 11th, 2021 COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the inequities that have long plagued New York City. When we break down the data demographically, we see that while all New Yorkers have been impacted in some way, those coming from traditionally marginalized communities have been hit the hardest. White Paper: On Reimagining School Safety February 25th, 2021 The Office of the Public Advocate sees a vision for schools and community safety that centers New York City’s children and families—schools that heal and address trauma, and center on de-escalation and supportive resources. We know the main drivers of safety in communities are access to quality and well-resourced education, healthcare, and housing. Schools need to address the ways those are accessed to reimagine public safety in our schools. White Paper: In The Event Of A Second Wave November 5th, 2020 When the first reported case of COVID-19 appeared in New York, action was taken too slowly, and in some cases did not go far enough. Knowing little about how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted, how it manifested in people, and how to protect communities, New York City and New York State were slow to enforce a shutdown. A lack of preparation for an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic led to an almost immediate shortage of medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not advise all Americans to wear face masks or coverings until April. Municipalizing New York City's Electric Grid August 7th, 2020 Although Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) have been the norm in New York City for the entire history of electrification, they pose some serious disadvantages compared with municipal utilities. Continued deferral of necessary repairs, a near complete lack of transparency, and little to no true accountability has made them a liability to the people of New York City... Addressing The Underfunding of CUNY, New York's Engine of Mobility, Innovation, and Economic Support December 6th, 2019 Funding challenges threaten to stall a major engine of mobility, innovation, and economic support that the City University of New York (CUNY) represents for its students and the city of New York. For decades, New York State and New York City have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support CUNY’s mission to be a vehicle of social mobility that provides a high quality of education to all New Yorkers, regardless of their economic status, race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or ability status.... Improving New York City's Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis September 25th, 2019 This report investigates how New York City responds to individuals experiencing mental health crisis. Examining the flaws in current protocols and the best practices of approaches applied in other cities, it presents a framework for an improved response system that would provide those in crisis with the services that they need and minimize the negative outcomes that are currently far too common.
