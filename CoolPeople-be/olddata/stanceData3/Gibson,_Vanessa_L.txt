Gibson Bronx Borough President     Vanessa L. Gibson was elected as the 14th Bronx Borough President on November 2, 2021, entrusted with serving the borough’s vibrant and diverse population of over 1.4 million residents. A proud native New Yorker, Ms. Gibson has dedicated her career to serving the people of the West Bronx. Her journey began in January 2001, when she joined the New York State Assembly Intern Program while a student at the University of Albany. She was assigned to work with then-Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene, where she gained invaluable experience engaging in legislative work, attending meetings, and connecting with constituents and community groups. After graduating, Ms. Gibson transitioned into the role of Legislative Aide and later District Manager, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Assembly office. She managed staff and ensured effective constituent services. Following Assemblywoman Greene’s resignation in May 2009 after 28 years in office, Ms. Gibson ran for the New York State Assembly, winning a special election on June 2, 2009, to represent the 77th District. During her two terms in the Assembly, Ms. Gibson advocated for crucial issues affecting her community. In 2013, she ran for an open seat in the New York City Council, succeeding the term-limited Council Member Helen Diane Foster. She was elected to the Council in November 2013. As a Council Member, Ms. Gibson became a leading voice in key areas such as education, affordable housing, public safety, and criminal justice reform. She championed alternatives to incarceration, tenant protections, and enhanced police training. She made history as the first African American woman to chair the New York City Council Public Safety Committee. In 2017, Ms. Gibson worked with then-Council Member Mark Levine to pass the landmark Right to Counsel legislation, providing free legal representation for low-income tenants facing eviction in Housing Court. She also led efforts to establish a comprehensive, ten-year food strategy for New York City, focusing on improving access to healthy food, supporting community gardens, and addressing food deserts. In 2020, Ms. Gibson announced her candidacy for Bronx Borough President, bringing forward a vision to tackle pressing issues including public safety, food equity, housing insecurity, health and wellness, gender equity, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community. After securing victories in both the primary and general elections, she made history again as the first woman and the first African American to hold the office of Bronx Borough President. Since taking office, Borough President Gibson has launched numerous initiatives to improve the lives of Bronx residents. She spearheaded a campaign to combat hunger and improve nutrition, working in partnership with local farmers’ markets. Recognizing the importance of bridging the digital divide, she secured over $50 million in capital funding to enhance technology in Bronx schools, ensuring students have access to modern learning tools. She has also championed efforts to reimagine the historic Kingsbridge Armory, with plans to transform it into an economic powerhouse for the borough. Borough President Gibson has been a staunch advocate for public safety. She works closely with the New York City Police Department, anti-gun violence organizations, and violence interrupters to reduce crime and create safer communities. Her initiatives include securing funding for security cameras and advocating for stronger fire safety laws following the devastating Twin Parks fire. Additionally, she hosts fire safety workshops to raise awareness about prevention. Borough President Gibson is also working closely with the New York State Department of Labor to create pathways to employment for job seekers across the borough. By connecting residents with job opportunities and providing workforce development resources, she aims to reduce unemployment and help individuals build sustainable careers. She also collaborates with the Bronx Economic Development Corporation to offer financial support to struggling businesses, helping them recover and flourish in a post-pandemic economy. Through her leadership and tireless commitment to the Bronx, Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson continues to shape a brighter future for the borough and its residents.

Born and raised in the vibrant West Bronx, he discovered his passion for the arts early on, propelling him through his academic journey. He graduated from The High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, followed by an Associate degree from Borough of Manhattan Community College and a Bachelor of Arts from CUNY City College of New York. Justin’s path to success was not a linear one. Along the way, he actively sought opportunities to give back to his community, volunteering at local food pantries, participating in missionary trips, and engaging with his local community board and precinct. His interest in political science grew, fueling his desire to create real change at the grassroots level and bring resources to the Bronx. After completing his Associate’s degree, Justin gained valuable experience as the Director of Operations at Norwegian Cruise Line, overseeing a team and living at sea. Later, he joined Citibank as a financial advisor, assisting residents and businesses in accessing loan opportunities, managing credit, and understanding the importance of saving and investing. In 2015, Justin started volunteering for then-Council Member Vanessa L. Gibson, eventually joining her staff as a Community Constituent Liaison. Recognized for his exceptional skills, he was promoted to Director of Budget, advocating for marginalized groups and providing them with access to capital and programmatic opportunities. Impressed by his dedication and abilities, Council Member Gibson promoted him to Chief of Staff, where he oversaw a team committed to addressing the needs of the Bronx. Now, as Chief of Staff to the Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson, Justin takes pride in fostering positive relationships with non-profits and corporations to bring essential resources to the Bronx. He views his role as an opportunity to empower underrepresented communities and drive meaningful change, preserving institutional knowledge while embracing new ideas and development. Inspired by Borough President Gibson’s exceptional guidance, Justin embodies a transformative brand of leadership. Always accessible and devoted to serving the Office and the Bronx community, his unwavering commitment fuels positive impact. Justin credits his remarkable character to the Borough President Gibson’s mentorship and support. His dedication to public service and unwavering integrity stands as a testament to Justin’s own transformative leadership. He tirelessly strives to drive progress and prosperity in the Bronx, inspiring others to make a difference. With Borough President Gibson’s guidance and Justin’s enthusiasm, their shared vision continues to propel the borough forward, creating a brighter future for all.

Mayoral Executive Orders Executive Orders 34 & 41 Executive Orders 34 and 41 act as a policy that allows all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status, to access important City services without inquiry or disclosure of their immigration status (with several exceptions). Read Executive Order 34 of 2003 Read Executive Order 41 of 2003 Executive Order 120 Executive Order 120 requires that all City agencies that provide services to the public create a “language access plan” to ensure that those that do not speak English can still access city services. Read Executive Order 120 of 2008 Executive Order 128 Executive Order 128 officially creates Immigrant Heritage Week, an annual Citywide program of outreach and education that celebrates the histories and traditions of the City's diverse immigrant communities. Immigrant Heritage Week is held every April. You can learn more on the Immigrant Heritage Celebration page . Local Laws Local Law 30 Local Law 30 (LL 30) is the City’s language access law, which improves access to City services for all individuals. ‎LL 30 requires covered agencies to appoint language access coordinators, translate commonly distributed documents into the top ten languages most widely spoken in the City, provide telephonic interpretation in at least 100 languages, and develop and implement language access implementation plans, among other requirements.

The law places requirements on the Human Resources Administration (HRA), the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS), the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS). Read Local Law 73 of 2003 Local Law 228 Local Law 228, which is sometimes called New York City’s “sanctuary city law,” prohibits the use of city resources and time in furtherance of federal immigration enforcement. The law also requires recordkeeping of any requests to the City asking to assist with immigration enforcement. Read Local Law 228 of 2017 New York City Administrative Code Sometimes called “the NYC Detainer Laws,” these three laws are meant to balance public safety with the City's commitment to being a welcoming and safe place for immigrant families. These laws impose certain limitations on the City’s criminal legal system to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These laws apply to the NYC Department of Correction (DOC), Department of Probation (DOP), and Police Department (NYPD). Read the Detainer Law for the Department of Correction (DOC): Title 9, Chapter 1, § 9-131 Read the Detainer Law for the Department of Probation (DOP): Title 9, Chapter 2, § 9-205 Read the Detainer Law for the Police Department (NYPD): Title 14, Chapter 1, § 14-154 If you have been convicted of certain “violent or serious crimes” or if your name is a possible match on a terrorist screening database, then the DOC, DOP, or NYPD may be permitted to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The types of criminal convictions that are considered “violent or serious crimes” for the purpose of honoring an immigration detainer are found in Local Law 58 of 2014 and Local Law 59 of 2014 . View a list of "covered crimes" under which the City will cooperate with detainer requests . New York City Human Rights Law The City's Human Rights Law protects against illegal discrimination, including discrimination based on immigration status. All New Yorkers deserve fairness and respect, regardless of immigration status. In New York City, it is illegal for employers, landlords, and others to discriminate against you based on your race, religious beliefs, color, age, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, and other grounds. The New York City Human Rights law protects you from discrimination in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodation. It also protects you from retaliation, bias-related harassment, and bias-based profiling by law enforcement. For more information about unlawful discrimination and how you can make a complaint, visit the New York City Commission on Human Rights or call 311.

Land Use and Zoning : Community Boards must be consulted on placement of most municipal facilities in the community and on other land use issues. They may also initiate their own plans for the growth and well being of their communities. Also, any application for a change in or variance from the zoning resolution must come before the Board for review, and the Board’s position is considered in the final determination of these applications. City Budget : Community Boards assess the needs of their own neighborhoods, meet with city agencies and make recommendations in the City’s budget process to address them. Other Community Concerns : Any problems that affect part or all of the community, from a traffic problem to deteriorating housing, are proper concerns of a Community Board. Limitations : The Community Board, its District Manager, and its office staff serve as advocates and service coordinators for the community and its residents. They cannot order any city agency or official to perform any task, but Boards are usually successful in resolving the problems they address.

For a summary of FY2025 budget priorities, click here . In making a request to the Office of the Bronx Borough President, please note that the office will only communicate with representatives who work for the organization applying.  There will be no communication with consultants, lobbyists or other external representatives regarding the request. The Office of the Bronx Borough President is mandated by Sections 211 and 249 of the New York City Charter to receive and disburse a discretionary capital allocation every fiscal year. The amount of funds available to the Borough President is determined by the physical size and population of the borough, as well as the City’s capital budget for that fiscal year. The Borough President’s discretionary capital funds are not allocated directly from the Borough President’s Office. Instead, any allocation made by the Borough President is placed as a line item in the budget of the appropriate agency’s budget [i.e. any monies for a Housing project would fall under the purview of the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development (HPD). After the city’s budget process is completed, Awardees are notified in writing when the Fiscal Year begins on July 1st.

This unit, along with the office’s appointees to the Community Education Councils (CEC) and the Panel for Educational Policy, reviews educational policy issues and concerns regarding Bronx School Districts 7 through 12. EDU works closely with agency and nonprofit partners to direct resources, amplify services available to youth and families, and create opportunities for youth throughout the Office of the Bronx Borough President through internships and initiatives.     Ways to Serve: Borough President Appointees: Community Education Councils Community Education Councils (or CECs) are like school boards and act as the governing structure of New York City Public Schools. CECs are made up of elected parent members whose children attend school in the District as well as two members appointed by the Borough President. CECs advocate and provide support for parents through their work with District Support staff and conducting school visits, as well as provide feedback on the Superintendent, and host town halls and public hearings. https://www.schools.nyc.gov/get-involved/families/Community-and-citywide-education-councils-cecs Application: https://www.schools.nyc.gov/get-involved/families/current-education-councils-cecs/currently-available-council-seats To be considered as a Borough Appointee, contact our Education & Youth Services Unit https://nycdoe.eballot.com/BPPA/en-BPApplicationForm     Current Appointees Current Appointees  CEC First Name Last Name 7 7  VACANT VACANT    7 7  Lisa Lisa  RIVERA RIVERA  8 8  Aurora Aurora  Ronda Ronda  8 8  Austin Austin  Rodriguez Rodriguez  9 9  Aracelis Aracelis  Figueroa Figueroa  9 9  Jamel Jamel  Allah Allah  10 10  Emma Emma  Green Allotta Green Allotta  10 10  Amy Ming Amy Ming  Tsai Tsai  11 11  Adeyemi Adeyemi  Oloruntoba Oloruntoba  11 11  Danielle Danielle  Vera Vera  12 12  Joscelyn Joscelyn  Mahon Mahon  12 12  Sharon Sharon  Rowell Rowell      Neighborhood Advisory Boards (NAB) Neighborhood Advisory Boards are made up of 7-12 community members who reside in low-income neighborhoods where additional resources and supports have been identified for community development.

Annual Develpment Report 2024 Annual Development Report Download 2023 Annual Development Report Download 2022 Annual Development Report Download Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) Proposals Greater Morris Park Download Harlem River Gateway District Download ULURP The overall intent of New York City’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) is to provide citizens and elected officials an opportunity to comment on pending land use matters.  In 1975 and again in 1989, the City Charter was amended and Section 197-c established ULURP.  It is administered by the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the City Planning Commission (CPC).  ULURP is also one of the specifically noted Charter mandated responsibilities of the Borough President, who under the City Charter must maintain a Bureau of Planning. In the context of ULURP the Borough President (BP) offers recommendations and commentary pursuant to the specific application only after the Community Board in which the matter is located has taken action on the proposal.  The BP may recommend approving the application, approve it with modifications, or disapprove the application.  Like the Community Board, the Borough President tenders a recommendation to the City Planning Commission which may concur with the Community Board or may not.  Likewise, the City Planning Commission may concur or not with either the Community Board or the Borough President.

How to Avoid Fraud If you need immigration legal advice, only go to a lawyer or someone who is accredited by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) or an organization recognized by the DOJ. Immigration assistance service providers are people or businesses that charge fees for any kind of immigration-related services. They are sometimes known as notarios públicos in Spanish-speaking communities, immigration "brokers," immigration "consultants," or "accountants" providing immigration assistance. Many immigration assistance service providers are not lawyers nor accredited/recognized by the DOJ and cannot give you legal advice . Learn more about what immigration assistance service providers can and cannot do for you . Immigration law is complicated. Beware of fraudulent providers who may indicate otherwise and make false promises, such as: An easy way to obtain a green card A way to get a work permit or visa immediately Statements indicating that there are no risks or consequences Claims of special influence with immigration authorities What Not to Do Do not pay for government application forms – forms are free and can be downloaded online at www.uscis.gov/forms Do not give original documents – give copies instead Do not sign any blank or incomplete forms Do not sign papers, immigration forms, or contracts that you do not fully understand What to Do Always ask questions – even if the provider was recommended by a family member or friend; you should feel confident about the provider Ask for proof that the provider is a licensed attorney or accredited/recognized by the DOJ Get a second opinion Only go to providers that have a physical location Ask for a written agreement that describes the services to be provided and is signed by the provider – read the agreement before signing it, and keep the signed copy for your records Get copies of documents prepared for you Ask for a written receipt that includes the name and address of the provider Filing a Complaint To file a complaint about immigration assistance service providers, call 311 and say "immigration service provider" or visit the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection website at nyc.gov/dca to file a complaint in your language. You do not have to give your name or immigration status to make a complaint.

Call 888-NYC-WELL, text "WELL" to 65173, or go online to NYC.gov/NYCWell . Common Scams "10-Year Visa" Scam In the "10-Year Visa" scam, unscrupulous attorneys and immigration assistance service providers tell immigrants that they can obtain a visa or green card if they have lived in the United States for 10 years. These scammers typically fail to adequately explain that to pursue this, individuals must enter deportation proceedings and prove "extreme, unusual, and exceptional hardship" to a qualifying family member. Phone Scam Targeting Chinese Speakers Scammers are calling and leaving voicemails in Mandarin from numbers appearing to originate from mainland China and claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy, Chinese Consulates, or Chinese law enforcement agencies. These callers request that you pick up a package or, alternatively, provide personal financial information, such as bank account or credit card information, to avoid issues with your legal status, or to avoid arrest the next time you travel to China. Scammers are reportedly targeting Chinese immigrants or people with Chinese last names. The incoming phone number for these scams is often similar to the recipient's own number or to the Chinese Embassy's real number, 212-244-XXXX. The scammers are also using email and WeChat in their attempts to defraud people. If you think you’ve been scammed, you can call 311 and ask to connect with your local police precinct to file a police report. The NYPD does not ask about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or other people who ask for help. Services are available in Chinese and other languages.

Menu   Text Size   Search Search  Primary Navigation The official website of NYC Home NYC Resources NYC311 Office of the Mayor Events Connect Jobs NYC.gov Privacy Policy     Print Collection of Information by NYC.gov In order to improve the content and usability of this website,  the City of New York (the "City") automatically collects several categories  of information from users. This information includes the following: The apparent Internet  Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service Provider  ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address  assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully  Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of your Internet Service  Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain  name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example Internet Explorer,  Opera, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a  user's computer. The date and time a user  visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications  used and forms data. The Uniform Resource  Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to NYC.gov (if  detectable), if such user did not connect directly to NYC.gov, or use it as a  homepage or "Portal". The City uses this information to identify site performance  needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors,  and to generally add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. In order to  accomplish those goals, from time to time, the City may conduct statistical  analysis of the data it collects. The City does not collect data for commercial or marketing  purposes, 3 and the City does  not sell,  exchange, or otherwise distribute the data collected by NYC.gov for commercial  or marketing purposes. Information Submitted to NYC.gov During a session on  NYC.gov, a user may affirmatively submit information to the City by, among  other means, electronic mail ("e-mail"), filling in and submitting an  on-line form, screening for benefits and services, or electing to personalize  NYC.gov and use it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted  information is stored in a secure environment, and will be used by the City in  furtherance of its duties and/or obligations to its citizenry (i.e.,  "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes to which your affirmatively submitted  information may include, but are not limited to, the following: Helping the City respond to  a request for information not readily available from NYC.gov Investigating a problem  reported to the City via NYC.gov 5 Keeping lists of parties  interested in some particular issue or facet of New York City life about which  the City anticipates issuing further information in the future. Sending informational updates and conducting outreach on topics such as, but  not limited to, public benefits and services and upcoming City events. Sharing information with other City agencies or offices or other government  agencies for the limited purpose of facilitating services and benefits, in  accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Disclosure of such information  pursuant to a request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL")  or court order, if such information is not protected by federal, or state, or  local law. 6 The City does not rent or sell personally identifiable  information (e.g., information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail,  etc., or other information that identifies or could lead to the identification  of a user as a particular person), nor would the City exchange or trade such  information with third-parties without a user's explicit permission. The City  does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable financial  information other than as necessary to complete a credit card or other  financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user. If a NYC.gov user has elected not to receive further information  from the City, NYC.gov will not send such information. If a NYC.gov user has  elected to receive further communication from the City, NYC.gov will only send  information in categories that are authorized by the user. If NYC.gov sends  electronic mail ("e-mail") to a user, such e-mail is NOT confidentia l, 7 and is identical in  nature to that information generally available to the public and news media. Security and Monitoring In  certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a  password to access or submit personally identifiable information. One should  not divulge a password to anyone, and the City will never ask a user for a  password in a telephone call, fax, e-mail or other form of unsolicited  communication. When a user is finished with an application or applications that  are password protected, such user should exit the relevant page(s). If the  browser used to access said password protected pages is a publicly-accessible  browser, users should close down the entire session and, if applicable or  possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password might  be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The City has integrated industry standard or better security measures  and systems into the design, implementation and day to day operation of NYC.gov  and its underlying servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the City maintains ongoing efforts to identify and/or block  unauthorized intrusions into or onto NYC.gov, and to upload to or change  information on or otherwise cause damage to NYC.gov or the information resident  hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The  act of using NYC.gov constitutes the User’s express consent to the City’s monitoring  of all uses of the system. If such monitoring reveals possible evidence of  criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration  personnel may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials,  as authorized or required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or  entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website,  and to track information during multiple visits to a website. The City uses  "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of NYC.gov,  and such temporary cookies expire upon the end of the browsing session. This  website and NYC.gov generally, do not use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use NYC.gov as a customized  portal, the City uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The  City may also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and  patterns of unique and repeat visitors for 311 Online and other sites on  NYC.gov to enhance their accessibility.  Web Bugs (a/k/a Web Beacons) NYC.gov does not use web  bugs 12 on its web pages or in any  html e-mail generated by use of the portal, or otherwise sent from NYC.gov, for  any purpose other than to identify site performance needs; to ensure  compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors, and to generally  add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. Children No applications on NYC.gov specifically solicit information from minors or seek  to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such  information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of  NYC.gov should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to  NYC.gov by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as  information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City strongly believes that parental supervision is an  important factor in Internet use by minors. Therefore, NYC.gov asks parents to  guide their minor children when children are asked to provide any personal  information online. NYC.gov further asks that children ask for and receive  their parent's permission before providing any information online. Health Care Information Any agency  subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and  its regulations (collectively, "HIPAA") that creates, receives,  maintains, or transmits via NYC.gov any Protected Health Information  (“PHI”), as that term is defined by HIPAA,  must comply with HIPAA’s Privacy and Security Rules.  The agency must also  require its Business Associates, as that term is defined by HIPAA, to comply  with HIPAA when, on behalf of the agency, each such Business Associate creates,  receives, maintains, or transmits PHI hosted by NYC.gov.   Nothing stated herein shall be interpreted  to diminish the compliance requirements imposed by any other applicable law or  City policy. Third Party Links NYC.gov provides links to,  and may be linked from, local, State and federal government agencies, and from,  or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links neither  constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)  or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s),  accessibility or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s).  Nor does any link between NYC.gov and a third-party website imply sponsorship  of such website, or the creator of such website Some content on portions of  NYC.gov resides on servers run by third parties. 13 Each agency providing  content for NYC.gov is bound by NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Any agency using a  third-party host, ISP, ASP or other combination of third-party transport,  storage, content or application provision services shall require such third  party  to comply with NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Intellectual Property The content of NYC.gov's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party  images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are notified, therefore,  that one should presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder  before reproducing or otherwise using images/graphics from this website. NYC.gov may change this policy from time to time, and reserves  the right to do so without notice.  Privacy Statement Footnotes 1 An IP address is a numeric  value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer network, an  individual computer or router, or a firewall (collectively, "users")  so that other computers on the Internet may direct Internet message or other  traffic to such users. Until the IP addressing system is changed, an IP address  will take the form of XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, where the X's are numbers between 1 and  9, and 0 for some positions. The term “user” may also refer to an individual  who has created an account on NYC.gov and any of its subpages. Go Back 2 A Domain Name is an alphanumeric value that represents the plain language (English or such other local language as is relevant) translation of the IP address assigned to a specific user or collection of users. For example, if a user had an IP address of 123.123.123.123, the Domain Name that represented that address might be WWW.HOME.COM. Go Back 3 Commercial and non-commercial marketing purposes include, for the purposes of this policy, Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail (colloquially known as "SPAM" e-mail), targeted e-mail for the purpose of selling products, or the sale or exchange of personally identifiable information between parties that anticipate receiving value in exchange for such information. Go Back 4 The City of New York's duties and obligations toward its citizens are set forth in the City Charter and in all applicable and relevant federal, state, and local law. Go Back 5 When  the City is investigating a problem reported to NYC.gov, the information you have  submitted through NYC.gov may be seen by various people. Among other City  actions, we may enter the information you send into our electronic database to  share it with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or  public policy development. We may also share it with a variety of other  government agencies enforcing consumer protection, competition, and other laws.  You may be contacted by any of those agencies. Go Back 6 Pursuant to Article 6 of  NYS Public Officers Law 87, certain categories of information may be exempt  from such disclosure under FOIL including, but not limited to, records whose  disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under  89(2) of Article 6, or might endanger the life or safety of any person. Go Back 7 E-mail is generally not secure against interception. If a communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information like a bank account, charge card, or other personal information, it is more prudent to send such communication by postal mail instead. Go Back 8 The City maintains user registration information behind a "firewall" and limits accessibility to such information to only those few employees that have special access rights to production systems. Sensitive information submitted by users is transmitted by Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology and encrypted. Go Back 9 For site security purposes  and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the City  employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.  Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this  service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud  and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection  Act, and such other federal, state or local law as is applicable. Go Back 10 Temporary or "Session  Cookies" are cookie files that last or are valid only during an active  communications connection, measured from beginning to end, between computer or  applications (or some combination thereof) over a network. Go Back 11 Persistent cookies are cookie files that remain upon a user's hard drive until affirmatively removed, or until expired as provided for by a pre-set expiration date. Go Back 12 A web bug is a clear, camouflaged or otherwise invisible graphics image format ("GIF") file placed upon a web page or in hypertext markup language ("HTML") e-mail and used to monitor who is reading a web page or the relevant email. Web bugs can also be used for other monitoring purposes such a profiling of the affected party. Go Back 13 These third parties are  computers, computer networks, ISPs, or application service providers  ("ASPs") that are non-governmental in nature and have direct control  of what information is automatically gathered, whether cookies are used, and  how voluntarily provided information is used.

Choose an emergency contact and memorize their phone number. This should be someone you trust or even your lawyer. Choose a standby guardian for your children. LawHelpNY and ILRC also have suggestions for how to plan for possible immigration enforcement. What is a standby guardian? Immigrant caregivers can appoint a “standby guardian” to take care of their child, in case they are separated from their child through immigration arrest, detention, or deportation. A “standby guardian” is a person who is acts as a “backup” caregiver in case the primary caregiver is unable to take care of the child because they are arrested or detained by immigration authorities or deported. Designating a standby guardian is not the same as giving up parental rights. Standby guardianship only goes into effect if a parent is separated from their child. not Standby guardians have the power to make important decisions for a child in their care, including medical decisions and decisions about where the child goes to school. There are no immigration status requirements to be a standby guardian. However, there are certain other requirements, so interested caregivers should consult with a lawyer to see if designating a standby guardian can help them plan for their children’s future. Immigrant caregivers may have additional options to help plan for the future, and should consult with a lawyer to discuss further. For free, safe immigration legal help, including help designating a standby guardian, you can call 1-800-354-0365 between 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday to Friday and say, "Immigration Legal."

Gibson’s reelection campaign, I can personally speak to her commitment to our community. She is actively engaged with every neighborhood, consistently responsive to concerns and dedicated to delivering tangible results. That’s one of the reasons I chose to volunteer collecting signatures for her campaign. Ms. Gibson works tirelessly across the borough to bring vital resources and services to our neighborhoods. Whether addressing housing, education or senior care, she is focused on the issues that impact our daily lives. She has been a strong advocate for public housing residents, bringing together leaders from different developments like Tracy Towers, where I reside, to address concerns, improve living conditions, repair infrastructure and secure much-needed resources. Ms. Gibson has also championed safer streets by supporting funding to our local police precincts, schools and housing by installing CCTV security cameras -- strengthening efforts to prevent crime and enhance public safety. She has advocated for equitable tree planting in underserved neighborhoods including Norwood and addresses critical climate justice issues, including the disproportionate environmental burdens we face in our neighborhood every day. Her efforts to improve our lives are wide-ranging. She worked to support economic development by organizing job fairs, helping local businesses access funding, promoting first-time homeownership programs and expanding affordable childcare options. She is also spearheading the creation of a birthing center to address the maternal health disparities affecting the expectant mothers in our community. Vanessa is always helping those in most need and helped distribute hundreds of turkeys to individuals and families at the Tracy Towers complex during Thanksgiving. What sets Ms. Gibson apart is her hands-on leadership. She and her incredible team are out there every day, working directly with the people she serves. She doesn’t just sit behind a desk, she shows up to our local community meetings, listens and takes action to make our neighborhood a better place for every family.

Phil Stern, the school’s associate vice president for athletics and recreation, was excited to launch the new facility which is open to all UMSV students, faculty and staff. It features four games played competitively by four university ESPORTS rosters — Street Fighter, Tekken, Super Smash and NBA 2K teams. “This space will provide a common area for competition to make new friends and to learn more about the gaming industry,” Stern said. The four ESPORTS teams at UMSV compete in the NCAA’s Division III Skyline Conference, along with the university’s other sports teams. “This state-of-the-art facility represents a significant step forward for our university, providing our students with cutting edge resources to explore the rapidly growing world of gaming,” Susan Burns said, president of USMV. Burns views ESPORTS as a dynamic field fostering teamwork, strategic thinking and technological proficiency, with the new facility serving as a hub for competitive play, learning, innovation and community building. “ESPORTS is more than just a game,” she added. “As we cut this ribbon, we open the door to new opportunities and experiences for our students.” Construction of the university’s ESPORTS facility broke ground last summer and the school refused to disclose the cost of the facility which features an extensive variety of gaming equipment, including a PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Gaming PC and a 90-inch screen. The setup includes the “center stage” which allows for a team of up to six players. In total, the space features 18 gaming stations in a dimly-lit, arcade-like setting “We’ve come a long way from playing ping pong and Atari,” Stern added. UMSV’s NBA2K roster, led by team captains Logan Phillips and Jackson Showalter, is currently ranked number one in the Unified Pro-Am Association (UPA) College League, a worldwide NBA 2K platform, with an overall record of 21-1. The ESPORTS Team is housed under the umbrella of the Athletic Department and will enjoy all the resources UMSV’s 15 other varsity sports teams benefit from, including access to the Athletic Department’s recruiting software and athletic training room, according to UMSV. The university’s ESPORTS head coach, Jadd Schmeltzer, who was drafted by the MLB’s Boston Red Sox in 2011 as a pitcher and later played minor league baseball, said it has been a thrill to be a part of the evolution of ESPORTS at Mount Saint Vincent. “It seems like everything is coming together now,” Schmeltzer said. “We started this program from scratch and now ESPORTS is part of the school’s athletic department.” Schmeltzer was named the school’s ESPORTS inaugural head coach in July, and has a roster of under ten students across four teams, each of whom he recruited from high schools in NYC and as far as Kansas City and Ohio. “Jadd [Schmeltzer] told me about this opportunity for me to go back to school and be a part of this new team he’s building,” Joel Lopez said, ESPORTS player and freshman at UMSV, who has a job in the 2K Games industry as an Esports Curriculum Specialist at the Center for Educational Innovation (CEI.) At CEI, Lopez designs and delivers daytime and after-school Esports programs for schools across the city, while he also helps build thriving gaming communities within schools. “I love gaming so it made sense to be a part of this process,” Lopez added. Schmeltzer thinks participation at the new facility will increase as more and more students get acquainted with it. In the future, the school’s ESPORTS facility has plans to host events for middle school, high school and professional gamers. As part of the university’s 2022-2025 strategic plan, the school looked to expand athletic programs based on student interest and cost-benefit analysis to enhance its liberal arts, professional academics and co-curricular programs. With the launch of this cutting-edge ESPORTS facility, UMSV has not just built a space for gaming – it has also contributed to the future of collegiate athletics.

The New York Police Department arrested about 170 people last week at City College of New York protest encampments, which included students, and some faculty, from Lehman College. Following the arrests, police blocked off the campus, and school officials announced a transition to virtual classes, citing “contentious and violent” protests as the impetus. But that description was not accurate according to Lehman College professor and program coordinator Stuart Chen-Hayes, who participated at the encampments three different times in two days, including delivering food to protesters from Riverdale businesses. “These are peaceful protests,” Chen-Hayes told The Press. “There is absolutely no need for anybody to be going after peaceful protesters the way (our elected officials), have. And if there is non-violence stuff going on, there is no reason for any administrator bring in outside police forces to violently repress peaceful action.” NYPD officials pointed the finger at “outside agitators,” saying 60 percent of protesters arrested were unaffiliated with the school. In published reports, a CCNY spokesperson said those figures applied to protesters both on and off campus. Arrests were met with dozens of CUNY faculty on Monday calling for Chancellor Matos Rodriguez to get the charges dropped. Hundreds of CUNY faculty, including Chen-Hayes, also signed a pledge last week to participate in an unauthorized sick-out day in support of the Palestinian people. Following the blocking of CCNY, several protesters set up encampments inside a campus building at Fordham University, a private college. “I have no doubt that something will return to CCNY,” Chen-Hayes said. “I suspect that you’re going to start seeing actions on all the CUNY campuses. Why limit it to just one that is now cut off? Why not do it at all the CUNY campuses?” Manhattan College’s director of the Holocaust, Genocide & Interfaith Education Center, Mehnaz Afridi, told The Press students have a right to protest, but criticized how they’ve delivered their message. “I believe we have the freedom of speech, but not the freedom of hate,” Afridi said. “To make Jews uncomfortable or to use antisemetic slogans or be anti-Zionist without understanding the majority of Jews are Zionists, even if they don’t support Israel in the government, it’s really disheartening to see.” Afridi cited a lack of leadership at Columbia University for the current state of encampment protests there. She compared the university unfavorably to Brown, where dialog about why students wanted divestment from Israel prevailed. “I believe we should be sitting and dialoguing, even with people who say, ‘Oh, we don’t believe in the State of Israel,’” Afridi said. “Let’s talk about that. Let’s have a conversation instead of making so many people feel uncomfortable, including non-Jews.” Councilman Eric Dinowitz, who visited Columbia University last month, told The Press he spoke to several rabbis and students who spoke about transferring or leaving permanently. He said one student told him she received a death threat following the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. “I think most every institution failed to meet the moment after Oct. 7,” Dinowitz said. “That was a moment where college administrators should have been keenly aware that emotions were going to run high and should have done more to give students the tools to have dialog.” Dinowitz was critical of a “citywide day of rage” at Hunter College held on Holocaust Remembrance Day. He said it was disturbing for those wanting peace . “There are some people there who just want to see peace, but that’s not at the core what they’re about, whether they know it or not,” he said. “At the core, it’s using the same language as Iran and Hamas, ‘day of rage.’” Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a consistently outspoken supporter of Israel, introduced legislation that would install a third-party antisemitism monitor on any college or university campus that receives federal funding. Torres did not respond to a request for comment at press time. Chen-Hayes said politicians are not listening to constituents, and not understanding violence by both the NYPD and in Rafuh is only making the protesters’ cause stronger. “We are sick and tired of all of our money going toward endless wars abroad when it should be going national healthcare at home, it should be fully funding free college for students,” Chen-Hayes said. More than 34,000 people in Gaza have been killed since Oct. 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Before bombing, Israeli defense officials said leaflets were dropped in eastern Rafah asking 100,000 people sheltering there to evacuate. Keywords Israel Rafah conflict

Under current New York law, someone accused of rape or sexual assault can use the victim’s voluntary intoxication as a defense. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz and state Sen. Nathalia Fernandez, prime sponsors of legislation to eliminate the loophole, were two of several panelists at the Kelly Commons room discussing the issue. “Whether you’re voluntarily intoxicated or involuntarily intoxicated, to me I don’t see the difference,” Dinowitz said. “Being drunk, being wasted and being high is not an invitation to be sexually assaulted, period. You don’t give somebody the right to rape you or do something else horrible simply because you’ve taken bad chemicals in your body.” Lizzie Asher, president of Macchu Pisco, a woman owned and operated wine company, moderated the panel, which included Chris Lake, executive director of Community for a Cause, and Angelina Perez, a Manhattan College student and president of the college’s chapter Its On Us, an organization that informs and educates students about domestic and sexual assault on campuses. Perez, a survivor of sexual assault, shared an experience from her freshmen year in which a male friend trying to lose his virginity fed her drinks and tried to have sex with her despite her rejecting his advances. The male friend took her into his bedroom, but a female friend luckily saved her, Perez said. My friend “proceeded to confront him and ask ‘What exactly were you planning on doing that night while Angelina was not able to give consent or even talk to you,’” Perez said. “And he says ‘Honestly, I don’t know. I was just kind of looking forward to see what happened.’” Lake, whose non-profit is dedicated to collaborating with communities and agencies to provide for those in need, said no one is trying to criminalize drunk sex. Rather they are focused on someone who is preying on someone else who will not remember drinking. The law already has a precedent for what is considered “too intoxicated.” “Bartenders are required to identify when someone is in need of being cut off,” Lake told The Press. “There are telltale signs: blurry eyes, glazed eyes, slurred speech, stumbling, incoherent speech, erratic behavior. There’s a certain point, if a bartender keeps serving them, they are liable for what that person does next.” The loophole dates back to the 1990s, when there was an increase in date rape drugs being used at bars and college campuses. “What may have made sense 30 years ago doesn’t really make sense now,” Dinowitz said. “We have to address a larger problem than that. And that problem is the people who aren’t necessarily being drugged.” Legislation sponsored by Dinowitz and Hernandez is not new. Former state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi drafted the law in 2019 and put it to the floor in 2020. Dinowitz, who was a co-sponsor of the Rape is Rape Act, said he knew immediately he wanted to deal with the loophole in the law. But, the Biaggi bill hit several bumps, preventing it from passing. The Press reported in 2021 that codes committee chair Dinowitz declined to bring the Biaggi bill up for a vote because of concerns from colleagues it wouldn’t protect those falsely accused of sexual misconduct. Last year, Dinowitz told The Press he didn’t want to see the new bill stymied due to a small percentage of fake accusations. In 2022, the Biaggi bill failed to pass at the end of the legislative session as a result of the language in the Assembly version of the bill and Senate version not mirroring each other. Biaggi claimed Dinowitz amended the bill without consulting her, the community, advocates or district attorneys. Dinowitz told The Press last year he believed both houses changed the languages somewhat. The tweak in the Assembly was in hopes of getting it passed more easily, he said. When asked what lessons Dinowitz took in moving forward with the bill, he referenced some of the 200 laws he’s passed, some of which passed quickly and some which took some time. “Some things just take a ridiculously long time, for whatever reason,” Dinowitz told The Press. “I’m not making any excuses, I’m just saying that’s a reality. And some things happen more quickly but my way of doing things is that I keep going and going until we get the job done. It’s really that simple … I never give it up.” Dinowitz said he’s committed to trying to get the new bill onto the agenda before the end of the session. The current Assembly version of the bill matches the Senate’s version. It has more than 30 sponsors, as well as support from district attorneys, and community and advocacy organizations. The voluntary intoxication loophole has already been eliminated in several states, including Minnesota in 2021, which saw the rate of rape decrease by about six percent the following year, Lake said. “It needs to be passed,” Perez told The Press. “It’s something that will affect future generations. Whether or not people believe that it affects them, it definitely does. Whether it’s by somebody you know, or it happening to you personally or even you just hearing stories and being impacted.”  Keywords New York rape loophole, legislation, sexual assault, voluntary intoxication defense, Manhattan College panel, legal reform, advocacy efforts Comments Other items that may interest you UMSV unveils new ESPORTS facility Seton College launches at University of Mount Saint Vincent to support underrepresented students LGBTQ+ Lehman students enjoy safe, inclusive campus College protests rage as bombs rain in Gaza 50 Years on the Job Building relationships simply by repairing one kitchen at a time Felix Lam has been the superintendent at 2465 Palisade Ave., in Spuyten Duyvil for 50 years.

The Press provides comprehensive coverage of the Northwest Bronx, including Riverdale, Kingsbridge, Kingsbridge Heights, Marble Hill, Spuyten Duyvil, and Van Cortlandt Village. Each week it reaches 10,000 families with hard-hitting reporting, lively features, action-packed photographs, and crusading editorials. A proud tradition of community journalism The paper is written for and about the people who live in these Bronx communities. It brings them news they otherwise couldn’t get at all, or could learn only on the grapevine. And it offers advertisers a way to reach Bronxites where they live, in a newspaper they depend on and trust. The Press reports news that residents need to know to make their lives better—news about schools, crime, parks, housing, hospitals, transportation, and politics. It carries stories every week about events and organizations that binds communities together, from the Boy Scouts to church suppers to civic associations. And it includes guides to entertainment, shopping, and eating out. In 1989, the paper became world famous when its office was firebombed, apparently in retaliation for an editorial defending the right to read Salman Rushdie’s controversial novel The Satanic Verses. For their courage in continuing to publish without missing an issue, the Steins , former owners of The Riverdale Press, were given the prestigious First Amendment Award of the Society of Professional Journalist. Later in 1998, Bernard Stein was awarded the Pultizer Prize for his editorials. In 2008 The Riverdale Press was bought by another award-winning group of newspapers, Herald Community Newspapers, owned by Clifford and Stuart Richner.    50 Years on the Job Building relationships simply by repairing one kitchen at a time Felix Lam has been the superintendent at 2465 Palisade Ave., in Spuyten Duyvil for 50 years.

But last week, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon came to Lehman College with an upbeat message, exhorting young audience members to believe in the power of their voices. “I as secretary-general have some constraints sometimes, political constraints, to raise [my voice] as high as I want to,” he said inside the college’s Lovinger Theater on March 17. “But young people, you don’t have any limit. Just raise your voice… We need you to rise up for civil rights, for social justice, for equal opportunity and fair play here in the United States and all around the world.” “I as secretary-general have some constraints sometimes, political constraints, to raise [my voice] as high as I want to,” he said inside the college’s Lovinger Theater on March 17. “But young people, you don’t have any limit. Just raise your voice… We need you to rise up for civil rights, for social justice, for equal opportunity and fair play here in the United States and all around the world.” Much of Mr. Ban’s speech focused on crises around the world and the U.N.’s efforts to alleviate them. “That flag, which you see here, is still the beacon of hope to millions, millions of people around the world,” he said, pointing to a blue U.N. flag behind him on the stage. Much of Mr. Ban’s speech focused on crises around the world and the U.N.’s efforts to alleviate them. “That flag, which you see here, is still the beacon of hope to millions, millions of people around the world,” he said, pointing to a blue U.N. flag behind him on the stage. He interspersed his comments about refugees from Syria, apparent provocations from North Korea and other crises with calls for young people to support the work and spirit of the U.N. “Over the years, the United States has been a very generous contributor of humanitarian aid, development aid and a leader in the fight against hunger and terrorism,” he said. “I hope that the students, as emerging global citizens, will make the case for even stronger global engagement.” He continued that students from immigrant backgrounds are in a position to sympathize with people who are migrating due to conflicts around the world. Lehman College says its student body includes people with roots in about 80 different countries. “Many immigrants’ families know the sacrifices your loved ones have made, including for those of you who are the first in your family to go to college,” Mr. Ban said. “Many of you may have a special window of understanding on the plights of those escaping from insecurity, inequality and injustice and bigotry.” “Many immigrants’ families know the sacrifices your loved ones have made, including for those of you who are the first in your family to go to college,” Mr. Ban said. “Many of you may have a special window of understanding on the plights of those escaping from insecurity, inequality and injustice and bigotry.” The secretary-general’s speech was the 47th annual Herbert H. Lehman Memorial Lecture. Mr. Ban noted that the college has a unique place in the U.N.’s history, since the campus was the site of the U.N. prior to the creation of its current headquarters in Manhattan. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted at Lehman. After a brief question-and-answer period, in which an educator read student-submitted questions to Mr. Ban, a number of students trekked to the faculty cafeteria steps away from the Lovinger Theater. Many said the secretary-general’s emphasis on the power of youth resonated with them, though some found the speech highly idealistic. “I know so many people on social media, they’ll say we don’t want something, but they don’t go out there and vote,” said Idowu Kehinde, 18, an exercise science student. “It’s really important that we act as citizens.” Sitting next to her, Malikka Wilson reacted to statements like Mr. Ban’s call to end poverty by 2030. “He wasn’t very specific… in terms of what we can do in the general population,” said Ms. Wilson, 24, a sociology major. “We all have those ideals, but you as the U.N. representative, you’re supposed to tell us, okay, this is what you can do.” Keywords Ban Ki-moon, Lehman College, United Nations, Shant Shahrigian Comments Other items that may interest you Blanche Morganstern, better known as 'The Jewelry Lady.' 96 Kelly O'Connor, mother of two, and a true lover of animals, 50 Sol Solomon, former features reporter for Riverdale Press, 74 Doris Redmond, always ready to help others, 92 50 Years on the Job Building relationships simply by repairing one kitchen at a time Felix Lam has been the superintendent at 2465 Palisade Ave., in Spuyten Duyvil for 50 years.

At the Bronx EdTech Showcase Friday, May 3, Lehman College provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and student success, Jorge Silva-Puras, delivered a keynote speech on the use of artificial intelligence to increase student engagement. Silva-Puras framed his speech around whether or not AI should be allowed in classrooms based on its functionality and potential educational uses. Silva-Puras framed his speech around whether or not AI should be allowed in classrooms based on its functionality and potential educational uses. His conclusion: absolutely, it should, he said. His conclusion: absolutely, it should, he said. Prompting AI is part of the learning process for students. OpenAI, the software used by most systems like ChatGPT, draws information from the internet to compile the best answer it can find. It studies data to deliver an answer, meaning it also must be asked a deliberate question in order to provide a meaningful response. Prompting AI is part of the learning process for students.

Silva-Puras said there is an extensive academic integrity policy upheld by the City University of New York network, in which cheating is the unauthorized use of material, while the definition of plagiarism is the use of content without acknowledging where it came from. Silva-Puras said he has no problem with students using AI, so long as they are following the academic code, professor decisions, and properly citing sources.

Lehman lecturer Ryan Miller teaches an Introduction to Philosophy course and an interdisciplinary capstone course on the philosophy of AI in which students are encouraged to learn and use intelligence programs as part of the coursework. Lehman lecturer Ryan Miller teaches an Introduction to Philosophy course and an interdisciplinary capstone course on the philosophy of AI in which students are encouraged to learn and use intelligence programs as part of the coursework. Miller said he finds, in both of his classrooms, students can benefit from using AI to check things like grammar and citations. He wants to teach his students to use AI in a manner that is both helpful and productive. In his introductory class, Miller said he finds the occasional misuse of AI, and it’s quite obvious when students have used artificial intelligence to do their homework. Papers turned in that incorporate off-topic literature or different texts from the same author are obvious signs of AI misuse. However, in Miller’s Philosophy of AI course, he is passionate about encouraging students to use AI because he believes it’s a tool that will benefit students in the world beyond college.

If you want to use a tool that can be used ethically rather than unethically, you should have some ethical principles in mind,” Miller said, adding there is an overlap between philosophy and artificial intelligence, as philosophy can dictate the ethical portion of creating a program with ethical principles. “If you want to build a tool that uses intelligence, it’s important to know what intelligence is.

Silva-Puras built his own virtual teaching assistant with ChatGPT and has been using the tool in his classroom with students.

Silva-Puras built his own virtual teaching assistant with ChatGPT and has been using the tool in his classroom with students. He created the assistant by inputting relevant data he wanted the AI to understand and draw from and he is now testing it within his classroom. A problem Silva-Puras said he sees in this process though is, in order to create his AI, he had to pay to use the ChatGPT services and anyone who wants to test the tool must also be paying for the service. That causes the dilemma, he said, of whether students should have to pay for the program for his class. While Silva-Puras does not require his students to pay for the platform, he hopes the future holds funding for schools like CUNY to invest in AI software that can become accessible to teaching staff and students at no charge.

Students visited various tables set up on the quad, danced to music and grabbed a pride flag to celebrate. The NoH8 campaign, known for its headshot photos with tape over the subject’s mouth to indicate how LGBTQ+ people are often silenced, also attended the event. The group took its 8 from Proposition 8, a 2008 law passed in California that, at the time, banned same-sex marriage. Since then, a lot has changed. Lehman students attending the May 8 pride event told The Press they safe and protected on campus, a reaction not often heard from LGBTQ+ people similarly situated at other schools. Junior Andre Vasquezii, for example, said they have always felt safe on campus, and there is a safe space for queer students at Lehman, even at night or while traveling alone. Dalila Turcios Orellana is a student member of the executive board for Crystal Queer, Lehman’s LGBTQ+ club. Orellana said the club currently has 55 registered members, a big jump from the last few of years. She said pride events like the one held May 8 help get the club’s name known to other students, which is good because Crystal Queer’s role at public events is to let the LGBTQ+ community know it is supported. The group also helps bring allies into the conversation. Ben Holtzman is a history professor and the faculty co-advisor for Crystal Queer. He said his time working with the club has been some of the most rewarding work he’s done at the college. So much so, he said, his work with the club made his younger self feel seen. “Visibility is important,” Holtzman said. “(So is) showing queer and trans students there are people on campus supporting them.” He said creating a open and out-loud space for queer and transgender people also helps straight and cis-gendered people understand them better. Student response to The Press May 8 made it clear Lehman has succeeded in achieving a safe space in a manner many other places have not. Graduate Professor Stuart Chen-Hayes has his thoughts on the matter. Chen-Hayes has worked at the college for 24 years, and was a former leader of Crystal Queer. As an out-and-proud gay man, Chen-Hayes said he finds his role in the lives of his students helps them feel supported and listened to. “Students really come to rely most on faculty they can relate to, who share one or more of their identities,” Chen-Hayes said, adding when his students speak up he listens and acts on their contributions because he feels it’s important to honor their voices. The professor said he wears many hats, including being the program coordinator for the school’s counselor education program, which means he gets to oversee some faculty too. In that capacity, he said he has made a concerted effort to fill his classrooms and faculty with teachers from all backgrounds and identities. For example, students expressed to him wanting teachers who speak their language, so he made sure to hire bilingual professors. “The institution as a whole has become much more diverse in terms of administrative staff, student affairs staff and in terms of faculty. I think our students continue to be super diverse,” Chen-Hayes said. He said a campus climate survey from a few years ago provided data saying transgender students at Lehman did not feel like they were supported or had visibility at the school, in general. This troubled Chen-Hayes, he said, because he wants the campus to feel safe for all and his department is just one of many. Still, he said he is grateful students feel seen with the help of the work he and his colleagues have put into the space, but there is still plenty of work to do. For example, Chen-Hayes said he has been fighting for a connection for LGBTQ+ faculty members. He said he has expressed on multiple occasions to faculty that he has felt isolated and alone on campus and, despite having found queer and transgender people within the faculty on his own, he wants the college to make an intentional effort to connect them.

The journey of Seton College began nearly two years ago when the Mount was invited to by the Come to Believe Network to participate in its Design Grant, in which higher education institutions explore the possibility of bringing secondary schooling opportunities to underrepresented students with an inclusive and accessible model.  University of Mount Saint Vincent president Susan Burns said she’s excited about the opportunity the institution has created, and for the incredible things she knows Seton College students will do.  One year ago, the school began serious planning for the creation of Seton College, an associate’s degree program designed for students with high financial needs who need a higher level of academic support.  According to Burns, the vision was to remove the life barriers that too often get in the way of a student’s success.  Despite Come to Believe drawing in colleges and universities with a hypothetical of creating a degree program, Burns said she knew immediately upon being invited for the grant she was going to make Seton College happen.  The year of preparation was spent determining if the Mount had the space, the resources and the goals that aligned with the Come to Believe Network to make a project this big come to life.  The college’s name came directly from the Sisters of Charity, the founders of the school. In 1817, Elizabeth Ann Seton — patron saint of Catholic schools and founder of America’s first Catholic schools — sent a group of Sisters of Charity to New York, where they founded the Academy of Mount Saint Vincent, the first higher education institution in New York for women. The Academy of Mount Saint Vincent later moved to Riverdale and became the Mount Saint Vincent that stands today. When the sisters heard of the plan for the associate’s program, they proposed the school be named for the woman who started it all, Elizabeth Ann Seton.  The sisters believed in the mission of Seton College so deeply they provided the seed money the university used to get the ball rolling on the program.  “The institutional goal is to provide access to excellent education for those who would not necessarily have access otherwise,” Burns said.  Students attending the school are provided with all necessary technology, lessening the barriers they may face to attend. All students attend college with the federal and state aid they are given, no costs or financial burden is placed on the students, another barrier to entry the university wanted to overcome on behalf of its students.   The 60-credit associate’s degree gives students a pathway into business, social sciences or liberal arts with the potential to graduate and matriculate directly into their junior year at the four-year program available at the university. For example, students could take courses on a pre-health path and continue their education in the Mount’s nursing program.  For students who don’t choose to pursue a four-year bachelor’s degree, the college is partnered with Coursera, an organization that offers professional certificates for students so that they can take college classes while taking Coursera classes to graduate and head into the career field of their choosing.  “They could do their associate’s degree toward business and a certificate in project management at no additional cost,” Burns said.  The metaphorical building of Seton College also required the literal renovation of Founders Hall to make room for the incoming students. All 20,000 square feet of the fifth floor was redone to make way for seven classrooms, 14 offices, a kitchen and dining space and a student lounge.  “That space was just sitting, waiting for this opportunity,” Burns said, adding that giving Seton College students their own space felt like a necessary addition to the ability to attend the program. Last week, the university campus welcomed 85 incoming Seton College students for their first day of classes. For the future, Burns does not anticipate more than 300 students being educated within the college because she and other school officials care deeply about ensuring the new college’s students are wholly supported.  The school was intentionally designed with four deans, a new space, no financial debt and free technology offerings in order to set students up for success. Burns said the Mount wished to design a program that left students feeling like they could get to know each other and the members of their support community.

Ritchie Torres has written a letter to Harvard University interim president Alan Garber asking the school to address campus antisemitism and do something about a Jewish student from Riverdale who Torres said faced “antisemitic harassment and intimidation” from an employee. Shabbos “Alexander” Kestenbaum, one of six Jewish students who filed a lawsuit against Harvard earlier this year, received an email, acquired by The Press, from a financial and systems coordinator at the school, Gustavo Espada, who asked him to debate the “Israeli role in 9/11.” Espada later posted a video, posted on TikTok, in which he held up a plastic machete and said in Spanish, “we’re ready to fight,” followed by images of members of the Jewish community, as well as a screenshot of a post from Kestenbaum’s social media. Torres wrote the incident was far from isolated; pointing out the Anti-Defamation League’s inaugural Campus antisemitism Report Card recently gave Harvard an F. Espada is “not a psychiatric patient, he’s an employee of Harvard University, which is supposed to be the flagship of higher education in the United States,” Torres told The Press. “Harvard University has a culture of impunity that enables antisemitism, antisemtic harassment and intimidation against Jewish students like Mr. Kestenbaum. My message is ‘enough is enough.’” Torres said Harvard is normalizing a “hostile environment” for Jewish students and has violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal assistance. This act is at the center of Harvard students’ lawsuit, which argued the university has become a “bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment.” “I fully support the lawsuit,” Torres said. “I think there’s clear evidence that there is a pattern and practice of antisemitism at Harvard University that’s too glaring to ignore. The fact that Shabbos Kestenbaum is the only orthodox Jew at the Harvard divinity school is itself evidence of a discriminatory problem.” Kestenbaum, who is studying religion and public policy, filed the lawsuit with fellow students and law firms Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar and Kasowitz Benson Torres — unrelated to the congressman — in January. Kestenbaum described the suit as seeking to hold Harvard accountable for its “systemic and pervasive antsemitism” on campus. The lawsuit was not something that gave him comfort or joy to do, he said, but rather something he felt a responsibility to both himself and other Jewish students. “We tried working with the administration to no avail, and we view this lawsuit as our last resort,” Kestenbaum, 25, told The Press. “Jews do not want to be treated with special treatment at Harvard. We simply want to be treated with equal treatment and it is abundantly clear that Harvard has not taken our concerns seriously.” Those acts of antisemitism, according to Kestenbaum, were students bullying and harassing Jewish students, disrupting classrooms to yell “globalize the Intifada,” and physically accosting a Jewish classmate, which he said was caught on video. Those acts, Kestenbaum said, have not received an appropriate disciplinary response, which, he said, Harvard has previously given to students engaged in other forms of violations. The night before the spring semester started, Kestenbaum said he was walking through Harvard Yard and found several Israeli hostage posters covered with antisemitic vandalism, including on Kfir Bibas, who was only 10 months old when he was abducted. Kestenbaum shared what he saw both on social media and national media. The next morning, he received an email from Espada, someone he said he had never heard of, asking to debate the “Israeli role in 9/11.” Espada, a Harvard graduate from 1996, asked Kestenbaum to issue a public correction of the “false claims” he made about the posters on social media and apologize. He also rejected claims he was antisemitic, adding he only hated Israel and Zionism. “I was so disturbed and caught off guard that I, of course, did not respond,” Kestenbaum said. Later that day, Espada posted the video with the machete, which included Kestenbaum’s tweet. Kestenbaum reported the incident to both campus and city police, who he said recommended he file a restraining order against Espada. Harvard never had an open dialogue in any capacity with Kestenbaum to take action, he said. “In consultation with my legal team, I had to have private armed security outside my house for a number of days because Harvard refused to condemn this,” he said. “To this day, they have not told me (Espada’s) whereabouts or whether he’s employed, so it’s a little frightening.” Harvard did not respond to a request for comment. Espada was still listed as an employee on the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations staff page at press time. The Espada incident and lack of accountability prove the point of the lawsuit, Kestenbaum said, adding the plaintiffs been trying for months to show Harvard campus antisemitism is real. Those allegations led the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to launch a congressional investigation into the institution. However, the Harvard Crismon, a student-run daily newspaper at the school, reported Harvard filed a motion in federal court to dismiss the lawsuit on April 12. A 38-page memorandum outlined “tangible steps” the administration has taken to look into and address campus antisemitism, the Crimson reported. In addition to Kestenbaum’s lawsuit, a complaint filed in February by several students alleged Harvard failed to protect students from anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab harassment and intimidation. The Muslim Legal Fund of America filed the complaint and argued Harvard failed to uphold Title VI. The February complaint said some students faced verbal abuse or had things thrown at them for wearing a keffiyeh, experienced racial profiling from professors and students, as well as a doxxing truck that went around campus with the names of students who allegedly signed an anti-Israel letter following Oct. 7. Torres told The Press he was not aware of the February complaint but said all students should be protected from intimidation and harassment. Keywords Harvard antisemitism

On top of a name change, the school will also introduce three new Division 1 sports to their legacy athletic program.  Currently, Manhattan University is home to 19 Division 1 sports teams including baseball, basketball, softball, soccer, rugby, tennis and lacrosse. This fall, the university will be adding men’s volleyball, women’s golf, and women’s acrobatics and tumbling teams.  Keith Prokop is currently the head coach of the men’s golf team and will take over as the head coach of the women’s team as well. Prokop said this will be his second time starting a women’s program from the ground up and he’s excited to be able to do it again.  After completing his own degree at Dominican University, Prokop became the head coach for the men’s and women’s golf teams with near immediate results. Upon his arrival, the team was ranked 203 in the nation, fourth to last. But after two years under his leadership, the team found itself winning regionals and competing at the national championships.  “It’s an honor to have them think so highly of me to be able to start this woman’s program and be able to tell these women’s stories. This is just page one,” Prokop said.  Prokop said life led him to his own professional career, but now he’s solely focused on coaching. He says watching his student athletes grow every year is the best part, and he’s looking forward to being able to witness that growth for the women coming in. Already working with the men’s golf team has given him a strong foundation he believes will benefit the incoming team, and he said he’s looking forward to watching how the program builds out.  In addition to the golf team, a men’s volleyball team will be gracing the courts at Manhattan University.  The funding for the volleyball team comes from First Point Volleyball Foundation, which is dedicated to expanding the opportunities for men looking to play volleyball. Wade Garard, First Point president, said the foundation began after he called friend John Speraw, inquisitive on the matter of men’s volleyball teams and why there seemed to be very few. At the time, Garard’s daughter was on a volleyball team and he saw the number of higher-level teams available to her, while men were offered few and far between. Garard and Speraw decided to change this, so they began the foundation in the hopes of providing opportunities for boys in high school, college, and boys from communities of color or underrepresented communities.  “When we first started, there were only 24 Division 1 colleges that sponsored men’s volleyball, and Manhattan will now be the 31st Division 1 to start,” Garard said.  The foundation provided the university with a grant that will not only help fund the team but also assist in providing scholarships for men who may not otherwise afford the opportunity to attend Manhattan University. Garard said he is excited to see the growth of another Division 1 program, especially at a school like Manhattan, “which has a storied athletic tradition.”  Prokop said part of his excitement stems from the support system in place at Manhattan: With the school, alumni and donors backing the new teams, he’s certain they won’t fail.
