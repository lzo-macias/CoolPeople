Contribute Contribute Contribute Contribute Privacy Policy Contribute (“Contribute”) is an online credit and debit card contributions
platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (“the Website”) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically
collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the
following: The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a user’s Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,
Internet Explorer, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer. The date and time a user visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to
Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address

Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The CFB uses this information to identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility
with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New York’s Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFB’s work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFB’s work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

To the extent these records contain information that is not considered confidential, such information may be disclosed to the public, posted on the CFB website, or made available on the Website as part of the contribution information. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact Candidate Services at contribute@nyccfb.info. The Website does not store credit card information. Credit card transaction information may be stored by the payment processor, Stripe. Security To process contributions securely, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a security protocol that provides data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity for connections to the Internet, to ensure that bank account numbers and personal data you provide by using the Website are not transmitted over the Internet unencrypted, and cannot be viewed by unauthorized individuals. Using the Website The Website is an Internet-based service that allows a Campaign to collect contributions via the Internet from contributors using their credit or debit cards. To use the Website, you must have an account with Stripe. For questions about Stripe, you may contact Stripe at https://support.stripe.com.

We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to Contribute, where, in the CFB's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you.

Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections? Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results? The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day. However, these results will not include any absentee ballot votes. After they receive all absentee ballots, they will finish counting and release certified final results. You can find election results at the NYC Board of Elections website. Visit the Board of Elections website Vote by Mail Back to Top Can I still vote in person if I request or submit an absentee ballot? If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Learn more about voting by mail Can I drop off my absentee ballot at my poll site? Yes!

Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions.

For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute.

The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account.

Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?

Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. How can we help you?

It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections?  Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results?  The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day.

For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help .

In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database.

To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute.

How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART?  In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time?  Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States?  Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?  Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law.

Who We Are In this Section: Contact Us NYC Votes is an initiative of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, the independent city agency that ensures local elections are fair, inclusive, and open.

NYC Votes partners with community organizations, volunteers, and other city agencies to register, educate, and engage voters across the city. We aim to build a greater understanding of the electoral process for all New Yorkers by having an honest dialogue about how our elections work and why they matter . Established in 1988, the agency also equips New Yorkers with information about the candidates on their ballot and how their campaigns are funded. Our matching funds program matches every $1 from a local donor with up to $8 of city funding, encouraging city candidates to focus on their communities instead of special interests.

For Volunteers and Interns The Vote-USA project relies heavily on the efforts of volunteers.  
    To get involved, all you need is an internet connection and the desire. 
    Here are some of ways you can contribute. Become an Intern Each year we host undergraduate and graduate interns with a focus in political science, 
      public policy, social sciences, and other related majors. We post internships with universities 
      throughout the country usually near the beginning of each semester. If your university does 
      not have an internship announcement please fill out the contact information below and an 
      administrator will contact you. Become a Volunteer Volunteers are folks who still want to make significant contributions to their political 
      process, but are not currently enrolled in school. Volunteers share some of the same duties 
      as interns, but play a more physical role in their communities i.e. speaking with local 
      party groups, chambers of commerce, etc. to help spread the work we do at Vote-USA. Contacting Candidates During larger election cycles there are thousands of candidates running throughout the 
      country. While we do scrape information from candidate websites and social media, we would 
      like to give the candidates the opportunity to fill out their Vote-USA profile themselves and 
      provide videos, so they can feel they are speaking directly to the voters. So we need 
      volunteers willing to go into the field to meet and interview the candidates, and to record 
      videos of the candidates expressing their views on issues of their choice. These videos 
      will be posted to YouTube and linked to from pages on our site. Upload Candidate Pictures and Obtain Videos, Website and Social Media Links Candidate pictures, videos and website and social media links are the most important 
      data we provide to voters. We present this data in our ballots 
      and reports to help voters compare candidates. We need help in capturing this information 
      and provide the tools to make it easy to do. Obtain Biographical Information and Candidates’ Views on the Issues This information is also very important but can be easily ferreted out by voters with 
      the links we provide to their website and social media pages. When there is a state election 
      or primary of particular importance, like presidential primaries or state general elections 
      we believe it is worth the effort to dig out this information to make it easily available 
      for voters to make comparisons. Enter State Election Rosters for Upcoming Elections Each state provides us with its election roster prior to each election. These rosters 
      must be loaded into our platform as quickly as possible so that we can provide timely 
      information to the voters. Here again we could use help. If you are interested in helping Vote-USA, please use to form below to 
    provide us with the information we need to communicate with you. If you would like, please 
    use the Message text box to tell us a little bit about yourself and/or how you would like 
    to become involved with our project.

About Us Organization and History Vote-USA.org was developed, maintained and is the sole endeavor of Vote USA Inc.  
      Vote USA Inc., established in 2004, is a Washington DC corporation with a 501(c)(3) IRS 
      non-profit, non-partisan, tax deductible classification. Vote-USA.org began because in 2003, the founder of this project, Ron Kahlow , 
      went to the polls to vote for the Virginia State Senate and State House offices. He found 
      that he didn’t have the slightest idea who any of the candidates were, or anything about 
      their positions and views, or any knowledge about the ballot measures. Some candidate 
      names, found on the clutter of street and lawn posters, seemed familiar. He questioned 
      the value of voting if voters knew nothing about who or what they were voting for. 
      This seemed like a major flaw in our representative democracy. To address the problem, 
      he launched Vote-USA.org. 2004 was the first year Vote-USA.org provided election coverage 
      on its website. Since that time, Vote-USA.org  has researched over 20,000 candidates and over 500 issues. 
      We have covered all general elections in all states and most off-year, special and primary 
      elections since 2004. We have provided voters with over 20 million candidate comparison pages. 
      In the elections of 2016 and 2018 we provided nearly 3 million voters with over 
      9 million pages of information. Philosophy and Mission We believe that American government should be “of the people, by the people, and for 
      the people” and that an informed electorate is essential for a thriving democracy.
      We therefore seek to inform and educate voters by producing and posting comprehensive 
      non-partisan voter information covering national and state elections and some local 
      elections. Our funding limited the depth of candidate information which we have been 
      able to provide and the number of local elections which we have been able to cover. Our Products 1. Information to Help You Vote More Informed: After you enter your postal address, your specific office contests, candidates and 
      ballot measures are presented. Candidate comparisons make it easy 
      to compare choices. These candidate comparisons include pictures, bios, websites, 
      social media links, objectives, and positions on many issues. Our goal is to make the 
      delivery of our information effective and your learning experience satisfying. All election contests and ballot measures on this site are obtained from various state and 
      local election authorities. 
      We invite every candidate to upload information to 
      promote his or her candidacy. For candidates who provide no information, we use volunteers 
      and interns to compile information from their websites, their social media, and other sources. 2. Your Current Elected Officials: You can see your currently elected officials via a button on our home page, once your 
      postal address has been entered. 3. Historical Information and Reports: By clicking the Historical Voter Information link, you can obtain 
      access to all our data from 2004 to the present. We also offer special reports, such as all the contests in a particular state election 
      or all the Governor, US Senate or House contests in an election. Staffing We operate with a small number of full-time and part-time staff, volunteers and interns. Funding We are funded primarily through contributions from private citizens, typically 
      100% tax-deductible. Home About Us Contact Us Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Donate For Candidates For Volunteers For Political Parties For Election Authorities Digital Ads Historical Voter Information
