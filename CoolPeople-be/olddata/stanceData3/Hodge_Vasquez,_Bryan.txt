Too often, crime goes unreported because people don’t believe they are protected, and Bryan is determined to change that. His plan focuses on both immediate action and long-term strategies to ensure safer streets now and for future generations. Increasing Police Presence to Deter Crime. Bryan is clear: The West Bronx needs more policing to immediately reduce and deter crime. He will advocate for an increased and visible police presence in areas with high crime rates to address immediate safety concerns . Bryan’s goal is to create a lasting sense of security by ensuring there are enough officers on the streets to prevent crime before it happens. At the same time, he will work to ensure that this increase in policing is paired with community engagement, better training, and accountability, so that law enforcement is seen as a partner in building safer neighborhoods. Addressing Small Crimes to Prevent Major Decline. Bryan understands that when small crimes go unchecked, they create the conditions for more serious offenses to thrive. Over the years, laws were made that limited the ability of courts to fully address these smaller crimes, leading to the very safety concerns we see in our community today. Bryan’s legal education and experience have shown him the value of maintaining strong judicial discretion to effectively combat crime at all levels. While previous leadership prioritized different approaches, these choices have contributed to the challenges we now face. Bryan is committed to reversing this trend by advocating for policies that give courts the tools they need to deal with crime comprehensively , ensuring that the West Bronx becomes a safer place where even the smallest offenses are addressed before they escalate. Community-Driven Crime Prevention That Lasts. Bryan’s approach to crime prevention is about more than just reacting to incidents—it’s about preventing them from happening in the first place. He will prioritize long-term investments in violence prevention programs that work, focusing on community-led initiatives and proven strategies that interrupt cycles of violence before they escalate. By expanding local violence interruption programs and integrating mental health resources, Bryan aims to create a sustainable model for public safety, one that protects the community today and reduces crime for future generations. Youth Engagement and Diversion Programs. At the heart of Bryan's vision is a strong belief in the potential of our youth. By introducing comprehensive mentorship and after-school programs, coupled with career training and educational opportunities, we're investing in a brighter future. These programs aren't just about keeping kids off the streets; they're about opening doors to new possibilities and guiding our young people towards a path of success and community leadership.

Bryan’s is committed to offering real solutions that will expand access to affordable and reliable transportation, ensuring that every Bronx resident can get where they need to go, safely and efficiently. Expand "Fair Fares" to All Minimum Wage Workers. Bryan understands the financial burden that rising transportation costs place on working families, especially those earning minimum wage. That’s why he will push to expand the Fair Fares NYC program to cover all minimum-wage workers, providing them with a 50% discount on subway and bus fares. This initiative will reduce transportation costs for those who need it most, allowing low-income workers to keep more of their hard-earned money. Expand Express & Select Bus Service. Overcrowded buses continue to create long wait times and inequity for Bronx residents. Bryan’s plan includes expanding express and select bus service to increase transportation availability in underserved areas. By enhancing these services, we can reduce congestion, improve reliability, and provide faster transit options to communities that rely heavily on buses for daily commutes. Additionally, Bryan will advocate for increased enforcement of bus lane violations to ensure that dedicated lanes are used effectively, improving bus travel speeds and reducing delays. Increase Protected Bike Lanes. Bryan believes that making our streets safer for cyclists is crucial to improving transportation options in the Bronx. He will push for the expansion of protected bike lanes to ensure that cyclists can travel safely through the borough. Protected lanes will encourage more residents to consider cycling as a reliable and sustainable alternative to traditional transit, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier, greener community.

Meet Bryan Issues Vote Volunteer News Store Español  ABOUT ABOUT Bryan is an Afro-Latino Champion of Community Empowerment    Early Life Early Life Bryan's story begins in the Bronx, born to Dominican parents who were the pillars of hard work and aspiration in his life. His mother, a small business owner, and his father, a university teacher, worked tirelessly to provide for their family. They were the heart of Bryan's world, showing him the meaning of hard work and the importance of dedication. However, as crime went up and prices soared, they moved slightly outside the city to give Bryan and his sister a chance at safer streets. This move, while promising, meant Bryan's childhood was spent visiting his family in the West Bronx on weekends and day's off in order to keep his Dominican roots and family ties alive. This stark reality of having to choose between staying amidst familiar surroundings or seeking safety and education elsewhere deeply influenced Bryan's perspective on equity and justice. They were the heart of Bryan's world, showing him the meaning of hard work and the importance of dedication. From NYU to Pace Law: A Journey Through Academia Bryan's academic path was marked by ambition and a deep-seated desire to give back to his community. He first attended New York University , where he immersed himself in Political Science, Public Policy, and Management. This foundational experience at NYU laid the groundwork for his later pursuits in law. Bryan then advanced to Pace Law School , a decision fueled by his commitment to legal advocacy, social justice, and reducing corruption. New York University Bryan then advanced to Pace Law School , Bryan Working with Congressman Adriano Espaillat in Washington DC  Bryan Working with Congressman Adriano Espaillat in Washington DC From City Hall to Washington D.C Bryan's professional journey is characterized by a series of impactful roles. His time at the NYC Council was marked by his dedication to resolving housing and landlord-tenant issues for his fellow residents. In Washington, D.C., he expanded his horizons working alongside Congressman Adriano Espaillat . In the courts, Bryan was a steadfast advocate for those in need, championing the causes of the underserved and marginalized. his dedication to resolving housing and landlord-tenant issues for his fellow residents. Congressman Adriano Espaillat . Bryan's Leadership Through Crisis During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bryan emerged as a community leader, coordinating essential food and mask giveaways. His commitment extended beyond crisis response; he also participates annually in turkey giveaways, supporting struggling families during the holidays. These efforts underscore his unwavering dedication to his community. supporting struggling families during the holidays.    Standing Up Against Injustice Standing Up Against Injustice Bryan's commitment to justice has always been at the forefront of his work, and when tragedy strikes, he steps up for those who need it most. This was evident in the heartbreaking case of William Figuera, a man whose life was unjustly cut short. In the aftermath of his death, disturbing footage showed an investigator sifting through Figuera’s personal belongings, a shocking violation of basic human dignity. Bryan was deeply moved by this injustice, refusing to stand idly by. He quickly organized a community fundraiser, raising $2,500 for William's family to help them through such a difficult time. This act of compassion wasn’t just about financial support — it symbolized Bryan’s unwavering belief that no family should face injustice alone, and that every life deserves dignity, respect, and honor. He quickly organized a community fundraiser, raising $2,500 for William's family to help them through such a difficult time.  For Bryan, standing against injustice is more than a principle; it’s a lifelong commitment to his community and to anyone who finds themselves marginalized or wronged. Whether it’s through his legal work, advocacy, or direct support, Bryan is always ready to take action when it matters most. Your Support Fuels Our Campaign! Your Support Fuels Our Campaign!

Yet, many face mounting financial pressures that make it harder to thrive. Our campaign is committed to easing that burden by offering real solutions that provide meaningful relief for workers and their families. Tackling Rising Utility Costs. Families across the West Bronx are feeling the pinch from skyrocketing utility bills, especially water and energy costs. Bryan is committed to capping these rising costs and advocating for more affordable utility rates. By holding the city accountable for rising water bills and pushing for reforms to reduce energy and internet prices, Bryan will work to make sure that no family is forced to choose between paying their rent and keeping the lights on. Expanding Tax Credits for Working Families. Our hardworking families deserve to keep more of the income they earn. By expanding access to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), we can directly increase the take-home pay of low-income workers. Bryan’s plan will push for reforms to make this vital program more accessible to those in need. Streamlining the qualification process and expanding eligibility will allow more families to benefit, helping them cover essential costs like rent, groceries, and utilities, which in turn strengthens our entire community. Supporting App-Based Delivery Drivers. Our app-based delivery drivers and essential workers are vital to keeping our city running, yet they are often subjected to unsafe and unfair working conditions. Bryan will advocate for better protections, including ensuring that delivery drivers have expanded access to bathrooms and eliminating "lock-outs" that prevent drivers from accessing the platforms they depend on for income. These workers deserve respect, dignity, and a safe work environment, and Bryan will fight to make that a reality.

With other website builders, you’ll spend days cobbling together a site that’s still unlikely to persuade donors, volunteers, and voters to take you seriously. With Run, you’ll be ready to launch and ready to impress from day one. Designed for Victory Beautiful templates designed to raise, persuade, and inspire Run was built by political and advocacy campaign designers with years of experience crafting effective websites.

Gone are the long days of searching for a template that has the things you need — only to find there isn't one. With Run, essential campaign components are just a click away.

With Run, updates and builds are a snap and your time is spent on what it should be: campaigning. Mobile Optimized Always unbreakable on mobile Run does not permit site editors to do anything that could break their layout on mobile, unlike other site builder platforms that are fragile and require significant effort to optimize. With about 50% of site visitors viewing on mobile, flawless responsive design is a must-have. Integrations Manage your form data professionally Run has an industry-leading integration suite that pushes form submissions directly to the tools you use, including NGP VAN, Everyaction, Action Network, ActionKit, NationBuilder, Google Sheets, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Hubspot, Airtable, DaisyChain, and Campaign Deputy.

Bryan understands these challenges and offers real solutions. Build More Housing. Bryan's plan focuses on creating housing that truly matches our community's income levels. By increasing affordable apartment options and streamlining the qualification process, Bryan will ensure that deserving families can secure homes. Additionally, he will champion community-centered developments that integrate local input and essential amenities, meeting the real needs of our neighborhoods while preserving our community fabric. Ensuring Safe & Sustainable Housing. Bryan is committed to maintaining the integrity and safety of our buildings. By truly enforcing stricter building codes, conducting regular inspections, and providing funding for necessary repairs , we can prevent tragedies and ensure that every home is a safe and stable place for families to live. This commitment to quality housing will protect our community's most valuable assets—its people. Lowering Costs That Drive Up Rents. The city has continued to push massive hikes in water bills and property taxes year after year, pushing rents higher and making it harder for families to stay in their homes. These unchecked increases have continued without action, placing an enormous burden on working families. Bryan knows that this approach has failed our community and is determined to change it. He will fight for caps on these rising costs and push for real solutions that protect residents from being priced out. Pathway to Ownership. Bryan believes that homeownership is a pathway to stability and generational wealth. He will work to expand programs that offer first-time homebuyers down payment assistance and low-interest loans , particularly for residents who have been priced out of the housing market. Bryan will also advocate for the creation of community land trusts that allow residents to collectively own and control land, ensuring that more people in District 14 can afford to buy homes and stay in the community for the long term.
