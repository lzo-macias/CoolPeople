The grounds are nothing but amazing. I would have never thought it was the 1st wedding that day being held. Staff was very accommodating & extremely friendly. The house to get ready is AMAZING! It’s like a little maze so many picture opportunities just in the house itself. However it did that rain that day so I was hoping to get more pics with it being the 1st day off shooting at this venue but that was not their fault just mother nature.

Submit Cancel Create your own review Average rating: 33 reviews Google Review by Phenomenal Photo Booth City & State: Washington, DC We've been to many venues in our almost 10 years of servicing weddings and corporate events at venues in this category, but THIS is how a barn venue is supposed to be done!!! It's clearly evident that instead of simply creating another "cookie-cutter" barn venue in the countryside, the owner had the vision and did the homework & research to create an event space that not only rivals & surpasses any other top-tier venue in the DMV, it surpasses any other barn venue in the area when it comes to the flexibility and technology that an event host or planner could desire, that your guests will thoroughly enjoy, and that your vendors need!! From weddings to personal and corporate events, Gordon Springs is one of the most accommodating venues in the DMV to host a truly Phenomenal Event! PERIOD! The layout, ample parking, multiple & easy access points for your event vendors, the accommodations, the terrace, the lighted lake fountain, the east and west view scenic views, are all awesome, but they REALLY did their homework inside with the lighting, the 4 (100 inch?) built-in screens (2 at each end of the ballroom), balanced acoustics, built-in down-lights perfectly positioned along the ceiling perimeter, a mirror-ball, a bubble-drop machine in the ceiling above the chandelier, and they've installed a very discreet master control area and technician up the corner of the room to control everything for you...including the synchronized disappearing shades on the floor to ceiling windows that also do the same to create an open space that flows out onto the terrace!!They thought of EVERYTHING, including a very strong 5G WiFi for your you, your guests, and your vendors! FLAWLESS! Google Review by Camillion Events City & State: Woodbridge, VA Beautiful venue, with breathtaking views! The Knot Review by Cassie M. City & State: Virginia Gordon Springs was an INCREDIBLE venue! Stephanie Swaino was the venue director as well as our day of coordinator and she allowed the day to go by without a hitch. She went above and beyond to make our day special. Stephanie helped us throughout the planning process to ensure our day was just the way we wanted. The venue was gorgeous and the team there ensured we had everything we needed. I couldn't imagine a better place to get married. I highly recommend Gordon Springs! WeddingWire Review by Erica S. City & State: Virginia WOW.... what a dream come true! Our wedding day and planning process with Gordon Springs was easy, fun and STRESS FREE. Stephanie goes above and beyond when it comes to making you feel welcomed. I would call her the fairy godmother of our wedding day. We could not have done it with out her! From the first tour she gave us where she provided my husband and I the feeling of a motherly figure. She even supported our drunk guest with a grill cheese bar at the end of the night. Gordon Springs venue was very well kept, from landscaping to spotless shiny floors and bathrooms. Gordon Springs was the best choice to mesh my country boy husbands want for a barn and vision of a luxury venue to host our wedding. The Knot Review by Elizabeth G. City & State: Virginia The perfect all-in-one venue space. Rain-shine-snow it really doesn't matter because they are prepared for it all. Our wedding this past weekend was everything we could have ever hoped for an so much more. Stephanie their event director is AMAZING and truly brought our vision to life. Absolutely recommend this amazing place. WeddingWire Review by Cara M. City & State: Virginia Just had my daughters wedded at Gordon Springs this past weekend. It was an absolutely beautiful wedding. A dream come true for my daughter. The venue is stunning and our guests were raving about how amazing the views were. Our day of coordinator, stephanie was the best!!! We could not have done it with out her!!! From the first tour she gave us, to answering all our questions through the planning, setting up the seating charts and decorating for the reception. She made everything fall into place and turn out perfect!!! She went above and beyond and was so easy to work with!!!! Wish we could do it all again!!! WeddingWire Review by Michelle W. City & State: Virginia My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful interaction with Gordon Springs! Stephanie is absolutely fantastic, she is so helpful, sweet, and knows all the wedding tips and tricks! She was so helpful setting up, allowed me to use some extra decor they had available, and jumped into action when and found someone to help when my bartender didn’t show! The barn and scenery are absolutely gorgeous and the setting was everything we could have asked for! The getting ready spaces were also so nice and prepped with snackies and such for us to enjoy while getting ready! I would definitely recommend the venue to anyone interested in Gordon Springs! Dixie City & State: Purcellville, Virginia Our daughter's wedding at Gordon Springs was absolutely perfect and Stephanie and her staff made it so! The venue itself is stunning. It is tucked away off of the road near the mountains. Everything went so smoothly and it was so awesome to have access to the stone house for the wedding party to get ready and hang out together prior to the wedding. We loved the bubbles on the dance floor! It was such a surprise for the guests and so festive! We highly recommend Gordon Springs for a wedding and could not have been happier with our special day. Thank you so much Stephanie!! Martin Gordon City & State: Leesburg, VA My daughter and now future son-in-law had a superb wedding at Gordon Springs Wedding venue! The ceremony setting was gorgeous in a serene scenic field that had a lovely pond in a field with rolling hills behind it that made for a wonderful back drop for pictures. In every direction, the view gives you reason to pause and delight in the beauty of the area from the 19th century dairy barn, to a 18th century stone Quaker house, to the rolling hills behind it and to the front of it along with the gorgeous venue itself with its stone patio for guests to lounge and take in the views. The layout turned out perfect for our wedding of 112 guests to comfortably mingle on the outdoor stone patio or obtain drinks and hor dorves inside with plenty of room to move around. Every aspect to the setting and the venue met our needs for functionality and beauty! In addition, we loved working with Stephanie that helped us to coordinate many of the moving parts. For example, she participated in meeting with vendors to ensure everyone had all the information to execute perfectly on the wedding day such as where the food comes in, options for the seating chart to go and more. For all our questions, she answered them to our satisfaction and made it a point to ensure we were happy with everything that went into the planning from guest parking, shuttle to do drop off and pickup, set up on the field for ceremony, guest flow to have drinks and dinner in the modern wedding venue, etc. Gordon Springs is temperature controlled that gave us total comfort knowing that whether climate is hot or cold, we could keep our guests comfortable. We came away knowing that Gordon Springs is set up with everything thought of and this gave another level of confidence that this is the place to be. So, Gordon Springs does it all….provides gorgeous setting and a magnificent wedding venue for a wedding couple. Lastly, we enjoyed all our relationships with all the staff at Gordon Springs and I wish my wife and I were related to the owner of Gordon Springs who happens to have our last name and enjoyed getting to know but are not related unfortunately. The newlyweds loved the place selected and all of us couldn’t imagine a better place. In summary, Gordon Springs is unmatched in all that it provides to make for a fabulous wedding! Google Review by Jacki F. City & State: Alexandria, VA WHAT A VENUE!! This venue is absolutely Outstanding as is Stephanie the Director of Special Events! First the venue - Gorgeous Views in every Direction, Private - on 30 Acres, Facilities are top notch with every amenity you could need. We had the rehearsal dinner and the wedding there and both were exceptional! They have 2 houses on the property that can be used as part of the 2 day package if it is available. Bridal party in one and the groomsmen in the other. Now about the venue manager - Stephanie is the ultimate manager and wedding planner. She made our rehearsal dinner and wedding flawless with her knowledge and expertise. She is thoughtful and relentless in her passion for making each wedding/rehearsal dinner the best it can be. We truly could not have done this without her. I would not hesitate to use this venue again in the future and highly recommend you add it to your short list of venues to visit. Google Review by Brenda B. City & State: Washington, DC I’ve been performing wedding ceremonies for 16 years and I’m so delighted. I was able to do so at Gordon Springs! Such an incredible venue, amazing views of the mountains, a pristine lake and wide open sky - this property is simply stunning. I had the pleasure of meeting Stephanie, whose wonderful smile, and upbeat personality created a warm and welcoming atmosphere for all who were gathered for the ceremony. Looking forward to the next time. Google Review by Paul A. City & State: Leesburg, VA Serene! I wish they had a regular lodge not just for weddings but where family can get away from the city life and breathe fresh air. Google Review by Carla A. City & State: Hillsboro, VA Lovely Venue! Gorgeous View! Google Review by Karl W. City & State: Purcellville, VA This place is amazing. Gorgeous views and grounds. The barn area is perfect for any event. The director of special events, Stephanie is best!! The Knot Review by Jess F. City & State: Leesburg, VA Stephanie and Gordon Springs saved my wedding!!! I had to find a new venue just 45 days before my wedding and we were SO lucky that Gordon Springs had an open spot. The venue itself is gorgeous and spacious but they have these amazing manor house and cabins on the property for getting ready (and spending the night! So convenient!). The grounds and pond with fountain are lovely backdrops and they have so many other unique features inside and out. We were so taken care of and everything went perfectly. We couldn’t say anything better about this place! Google Review by Ang S. City & State: Virginia We attended a wedding here last night, May 13. The entire experience was STELLAR! The rain tent placed up as the weather moved in proved to add to the romance of the event. Chandeliers, twinkle lights, gorgeous flowers and a real butterfly flew in during the vows. It was magical against the mist on the hills beyond the water. The STAFF - oh my goodness! They could NOT have been more in tune and in step with each other. So cheerful and nice! Truly, they were all outstanding! The reception hall was gorgeously adorned with giant paper flowers, real flowers, and the table settings were exquisite! Adorned with flowers, candles and an eclectic set of beautiful glasses, along with beautiful plates and chargers. We drove over 1,250 miles for this special wedding and every.single.detail made it all worth it! The bride and groom and their families couldn't have been more pleased. Thanks for making us all feel so welcome. It was truly a wonderful experience we will never forget! If I could give you 10 gold stars I would! Wait - here you go! Well deserved! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sal Fondaco City & State: Leesburg What can I say about Gordon Springs? Six weeks before my daughter's wedding day, we found out that our original venue would be unable to host our reception and we needed to find a new venue. My wife found Gordon Springs on the internet. We went up for a visit and Stephanie immediately put our minds at ease. The property was beautiful, the venue was perfect, and the accommodations for the bridal party were outstanding. Stephanie and Steve did everything possible to make our day smooth and enjoyable and they truly delivered. We can't say enough about the team, the venue and the overall experience at Gordon Springs. It was a magical day and provided the bride and groom with a memory they will never forget. For anyone planning a wedding reception, please consider Gordon Springs and let Stephanie and team make your event as special as ours was! Virginia  LaFonte City & State: Purcellville, Virginia Do you want a venue, with an event director who will create something possible that you may think is Impossible? Look no further! Gordon Springs, set in Virginia's beautiful country landscape, coupled with peaceful outdoor lighting, just invites you to enter into a new barn, constructed with everything you've dreamt about. Lights, music and decorations gave us such an incredible celebratory feeling in order to have such a successful, exciting 60th birthday party. It come off without a hitch. Truly, this could only have been done with the expertise of their event director, Stephanie. Once you meet her, you've found your place for special parties, and beautiful weddings! No matter how big your event is, this lovely place is an "all in one" venue that can even have a more intimate setting or even a business meeting/party. As long as Stephanie and Gordon Springs is on top of it, they are all you need to relax, enjoy and know your celebration has been taken care of from top to bottom. 5 stars, should be 10 stars! Thank you Gordon Springs! Lauren N. City & State: Purcellville, VA After looking at numerous venues in the Northern VA area, pulling up to Gordon Springs was an immediate YES for us. We had our minds set that we wanted a small intimate 'micro wedding' and it was truly perfect. From the beautiful property, the immaculate barn, and multiple options for ceremonies/parties, we had endless visions of making our special day perfect here. From 50 people to 200 people, there is so much potential for an incredible wedding/party/celebration. Stephanie went above and beyond to make the process easy and extremely stress-free! She was personable, which just grew us stronger to be more confident throughout the planning process. Day of, she worked quietly behind the scenes to allow our family and friends to enjoy the entire day. Our vendors were stunned with the property (Roomy areas to get ready, photographer creativity/options were endless) and were excited to share their experience with us! BOOK IT! You will not be disappointed! Google Review by Virginia P. City & State: Middleburg, VA Gorgeous, all-inclusive wedding space. We love working with Gordon Springs! Google Review by Dr. J Cooper City & State: Leesburg, VA 30 acres of beautiful freedom. The Knot Review by Frank T. City & State: Purcellville, VA This place is amazing! I had the privilege of working an event with a vendor and was so impressed with the beautiful views from the venue with retractable doors that overlook the large flagstone patio with stunning and peaceful views surrounding the barn venue. The barn itself has an interior large enough to accommodate a large party as well as intimate enough for a smaller gathering. Very impressed with this property! The Knot Review by Amanda O. City & State: Purcellville, VA I love this venue! The privacy, views, versatility of events, and proximity to the city make it stand out from others. I’ve been to a wedding, Ladies Lunch, and this season’s Holiday Open House at this venue! Even on the wedding day the ceremony was scheduled to be outdoors, but it stormed and the team quickly pivoted without hiccup organizing a beautiful ceremony in the barn that also served as the reception space. We partied into the night. I definitely recommend!! The Knot Review by Christina C. City & State: Purcellville, VA Gordon Springs was a beautiful setting for our planning client's wedding day! The expansive field was the perfect location for the ceremony set against an amazing backdrop of mountain views with a pond. The patio was plenty of space for the cocktail hour and lawn games and the reception was held inside the main barn. As their wedding planner, I was always able to get timely responses from venue staff and communication was always clear with thorough, detailed information to help make the planning process seamless. Day-of, all the staff on-site were so lovely and super helpful whenever we had questions or needed assistance. It was an amazing day with great weather for a November wedding and our couple couldn't have been happier with the whole experience. Bonus points for overnight accommodations right on-site! Would recommend Gordon Springs for couples looking to celebrate a scenic, private wedding day! The Knot Review by Rose M. City & State: Purcellville, VA This beautiful venue tucked away in the hills of the Northern Virginia wine country is worth a 5 star review! I was immediately drawn to the beauty of the views, landscaping and interior of the venue. I have been to other "rustic settings" where events in the area were held, but Gordon Springs certainly stands out with not only the views, but the flagstone patio overlooking it's beauty, and that gorgeous chandelier in the barn! At night, the grounds have such beautiful lighting that it takes on a whole new ambiance! Absolutely stunning! Facebook Review by Jen D. City & State: Leesburg, VA Beautiful property but more importantly the best planning expertise The Knot Review by Susan N. City & State: Purcellville, VA I attended an event at Gordon Springs & was so impressed by the beautiful venue, landscaping & incredibly views surrounding the venue. If you are looking to hold an event from a wedding to a family event with unforgettable memories, Gordon Springs is where you want to be! Treat yourself & your guests to a beautiful experience! The Knot Review by Denise A. City & State: Purcellville, VA First, I would like to say the venue itself is amazing! The 20-plus acre farm was enough space to create the wedding of your dreams. Late October was the perfect time to marry at Gordon Springs. The entire staff was first class through the whole process; keeping us up to date on everything, even recommending vendors and places to stay for guests. Facebook Review by The Polished Foxx City & State: Leesburg, VA The folks on site are extremely welcoming and insightful of the property. On site lodging, amazing audio visual and lighting capabilities, rolling views. . . a gem you just have to see. Google Review by C Hogan City & State: Washington, DC Beautiful and tranquil. Google Review by Miriam L. City & State: Leesburg, VA Wow! What an incredible new venue in Loudoun Country. The views, the facilities, and the amenities are all top-notch. This place will be filled before long so wedding couples need to book this fast. The reception facility has so many modern touches for sound and lighting and the space is quite larger than it appears when you drive up. The views and pond surrounding the property is picturesque and so calm. There are also two amazing living/sleep quarters for overnight stays. I loved it there. I didn't want to leave. Google Review by Patrick G. City & State: Fredericksburg, VA Gorgeous event venue with breathtaking views and features. You'll have to set up a tour to truly appreciate it. Facebook Review by Mindy L. City & State: Halethorpe, MD I am a photographer I had the opportunity to be able to shoot the 1st wedding there. The grounds are nothing but amazing. I would have never of thought it was the 1st wedding that day being held. Staff was very accommodating & extremely friendly. The house to get ready is AMAZING! Its like a little maze so many picture opportunities just in the house itself. However it did that rain that day so I was hoping to get more pics with it being the 1st day off shooting at this venue but that was not their fault just mother nature. I highly recommend this venue cant wait to come back without the rain! This venue is definite must see in person!
