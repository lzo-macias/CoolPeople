Carr (Author) (Author) (Author) 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars   1 rating 1 rating    See all formats and editions Purchase options and add-ons  There is general agreement in the field of Biblical studies that study of the formation of the Pentateuch is in disarray. David M. Carr turns to the Genesis Primeval History, Genesis 1-11, to offer models for the formation of Pentateuchal texts that may have traction within this fractious context. Building on two centuries of historical study of Genesis 1-11, this book provides new support for the older theory that the bulk of Genesis 1-11 was created out of a combination of two originally separate source strata: a Priestly source and an earlier non-Priestly source that was used to supplement the Priestly framework. Though this overall approach contradicts some recent attempts to replace such source models with theories of post-Priestly scribal expansion, Carr does find evidence of multiple layers of scribal revision in the non-P and P sources, from the expansion of an early independent non-Priestly primeval history with a flood narrative and related materials to a limited set of identifiable layers of Priestly material that culminate in the P-like redaction of the whole. This book synthesizes prior scholarship to show how both the P and non-Priestly strata of Genesis also emerged out of a complex interaction by Judean scribes with non-biblical literary traditions, particularly with Mesopotamian textual traditions about primeval origins. The Formation of Genesis 1-11 makes a significant contribution to scholarship on one of the most important texts in the Hebrew Bible and will influence models for the formation of the Hebrew Bible as a whole.

David M. Carr David M. Carr David M. Carr         Home HB Intro Teaching Resources Carr Video Lectures Biography Prior Publications Info About and Reviews of Holy Resilience: The Bible's Traumatic Origins (Yale University Press, Fall 2014) Home (My name is David Carr, and I am a professor of Hebrew Bible at Union Theological Seminary in New York , father of four, cyclist, and organ player. I am the author, most recently, of The Hebrew Bible: A Contemporary Introduction to the Christian Old Testament and Jewish Tanakh (Wiley Blackwell, 2021). This book provides a historically-oriented introduction to the rich diversity of perspectives in the Hebrew Bible and diversity of methods used to study it. In addition, I recently published a commentary on Genesis 1-11 (International Exegetical Commentary on the Old Testament; Kohlhammer, 2021) and accompanying monograph on the formation of those chapters, The Formation of Genesis 1-11: Biblical and Other Precursors (Oxford University Press, 2020). My most recent trade book for a wide audience is Holy Resilience: The Bible's Traumatic Origins (Yale University Press, 2014; order here ), which retells the story of the emergence of the Bible and of Judaism and Christianity as a story of survival of trauma. This book is a culmination of other research that I've done over the last twenty-five years. Use the buttons to the left for more information on Holy Resilience, that research, and links to online lectures that I've prepared on the origins of the Bible, with a focus on the formation of the Torah/Pentateuch.    Videos and Web Articles (click on the links below) For a brief intro to my work on trauma and the Bible see this well-produced, three-minute long Union video. An episode of the "Data Over Dogma" podcast with the two Dan's on my work on Genesis 1-11. An episode of the Digital Hammurabi podcast where I discuss the formation of the Pentateuch and scribes with Kipp Davis. Links to a preview and parts, 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 of an extended interview on Trauma and Biblical Origins with Dr. Yeshaya Gruber of the Israel Bible Center. A brief (less than 4 minute) video summary of how the Bible gained its lasting power by being formed in the crucible of suffering. A 42 minute video interview about Holy Resilience with Robert Wright on Meaningoflife.tv . An interview with Jonathan Petersen about Holy Resilience on the Bible Gateway blog site. A review in Marginalia of two important recent works on the formation of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. 5 Lessons the Bible Teaches about Trauma for the On Faith Website Article assembled for the Huffington Post by my students in the Bedford Hills Prison-UTS class -- "Incarcerated Women Reflect on Jesus' Seven Last Words on the Cross" Bible Odessey article  on “The Cry of Abel’s Blood” Valentines Day and the Bible on the History News Network A New Years Day piece for Time.com and History News Network on "Are We More Like the Roman Empire Than We Care to Admit?"

"Just as the biblical text emerged in response to trauma, this may be an important time to let the text touch the power and pain of trauma yet again. Carr has provided an accessible guide for further work, and this new cognitive dis cipline for scripture study is sure to be of immense importance for some time to come." Walter Brueggemann in the Sept. 2, 2015 Issue of the Christian Century .

Building on his prior work, Writing on the Tablet of the Heart (Oxford, 2005), he explores both the possibilities and limits of reconstruction of pre-stages of the Bible. The method he advocates is a ''methodologically modest'' investigation of those pre-stages, utilizing criteria and models derived from his survey of documented examples of textual revision in the Ancient Near East. The result is a new picture of the formation of the Hebrew Bible, with insights on the initial emergence of Hebrew literary textuality, the development of the first Hexateuch, and the final formation of the Hebrew Bible. Where some have advocated dating the bulk of the Hebrew Bible in a single period, whether relatively early (Neo-Assyrian) or late (Persian or Hellenistic), Carr uncovers specific evidence that the Hebrew Bible contains texts dating across Israelite history, even the early pre-exilic period (10th-9th centuries). He traces the impact of Neo-Assyrian imperialism on eighth and seventh century Israelite textuality. He uses studies of collective trauma to identify marks of the reshaping and collection of traditions in response to the destruction of Jerusalem and Babylonian exile. He develops a picture of varied Priestly reshaping of narrative and prophetic traditions in the Second Temple period, including the move toward eschatological and apocalyptic themes and genres. And he uses manuscript evidence from Qumran and the Septuagint to find clues to the final literary shaping of the proto-Masoretic text, likely under the Hasmonean monarchy.

This introduction to the Hebrew Bible is unique in introducing students to how the Bible was formed amidst experiences of communal trauma. Students learn the story of Judah and Israel and read texts of the Bible that relate to each period. It also surveys the diverse methods used to read the Bible today, including important newer perspectives from ecological, postcolonial, womanist, and African American scholars. This commentary offers a new translation of Genesis 1-11 and a detailed commentary on the shape and background of influential biblical stories of creation, murder, and flood. Written for specialists and advanced students, this book surveys the sources of Genesis 1-11, both Ancient Near Eastern traditions of creation and flood and ancient Israelite oral and written traditions. Written for specialists and advanced students, this is three books in one: a discussion of methodology in study of the formation of the Hebrew Bible, a survey of the Bible's formation from latest (more reconstructable) layers to earlier (more hypothetical) stages, and a discussion of whether the Hebrew Bible contains remnants of early literature preceding the time of Assyrian domination.
