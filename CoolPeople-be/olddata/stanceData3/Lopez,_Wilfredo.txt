Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram X-twitter X-twitter Linkedin Linkedin Donate  Donate Home Meet Wil Issues Gallery Get Involved Home Meet Wil Issues Gallery Get Involved Donate  Donate Issues Democrat for NY CIty Council Wil On The Issues  Affordable Housing I BELIEVE that housing is a Human Right. I BELIEVE WE ALL DESERVE safe, affordable, and stable housing. WE ALL DESERVE I am a life-long tenant who knows first-hand the challenges of living in a community where 93.2% of residents are renters and more than half—56%—are rent-burdened. I understand the stress and fear that come with owing back rent and facing potential eviction. In this district, where only 6.8% are homeowners compared to nearly a third citywide, our neighbors don’t just face affordability issues; they face an uphill battle for stability and security in their homes. I am a life-long tenant who knows first-hand the challenges of living in a community where 93.2% of residents are renters and more than half—56%—are rent-burdened. I understand the stress and fear that come with owing back rent and facing potential eviction. In this district, where only 6.8% are homeowners compared to nearly a third citywide, our neighbors don’t just face affordability issues; they face an uphill battle for stability and security in their homes. I have personally taken on unscrupulous landlords who exploit these vulnerabilities. During the pandemic, when our building’s gas was shut off by a slumlord, my neighbors and I organized a tenant association and began a rent strike. It was the eviction moratorium that gave us the courage to take a stand, and we succeeded in making our voices heard. I am committed to supporting legislation and policies that protect tenants’ rights, prevent displacement, and expand access to truly affordable housing. This includes creating more opportunities for home ownership. We need to build more housing, especially for low-income families and our seniors. We need to ensure that District 8 residents—long-time renters, families, and vulnerable communities—have the security they need to build their lives without the constant threat of losing their homes. Read Wil’s Full Housing Plan Here One Page Summary Here One Page Summary Fixing NYCHA I BELIEVE that safe, decent housing is a fundamental human right, and that improving NYCHA should be a top priority.. I BELIEVE WE ALL DESERVE homes that are safe, clean, and maintained with respect and care. WE ALL DESERVE Our NYCHA residents, who have built and sustained our communities, deserve more than just band-aid fixes; they deserve full-scale investment and modernization of their homes. District 8 is home to more NYCHA units—22,741—than any other district in NYC, and yet these buildings have been left to deteriorate due to decades of neglect and underinvestment from all levels of government. We face a staggering $10.6 billion in NYCHA capital needs here in District 8  If we don’t act now, we’re setting up a tragic loss of affordable housing for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. Residents in our district have been forced to endure unlivable conditions, from chronic mold and pests to unreliable heat and elevators, all of which profoundly impact both physical and mental health. It is time to end the cycle of neglect and take action to provide NYCHA residents with the quality housing they deserve. Public Safety I BELIEVE IN creating a safer South Bronx and East Harlem by curbing gun violence and by supporting community-led initiatives and funding services that create stability in our neighborhood. I BELIEVE IN WE ALL DESERVE safe neighborhoods for our families, safe parks for our children, and safe streets for our small businesses. WE ALL DESERVE This District is my home and where I want to raise my family. I want them and every resident to live here without fear of violence or crime. I will work to bring the resources East Harlem and the South Bronx deserve and invest them in community-led initiatives that will make our neighborhood safe for all. Job Creation & Workers' Rights I BELIEVE IN every worker’s right to unionize. I BELIEVE IN WE ALL DESERVE good pay for good jobs. We should not have to work multiple jobs just to have money to live a comfortable life. We all deserve to be protected against abuse and exploitation at work. WE ALL DESERVE Working at the New York City Council, I saw colleagues being harassed and exploited, so I joined with my colleagues to form a union, the largest municipal employees union in the nation. We fought against the establishment and managed to win recognition. Education I BELIEVE IN providing a well-rounded education for our children, complete with arts, music, computer science, and financial literacy. I BELIEVE IN WE ALL DESERVE well-funded schools for our children. WE ALL DESERVE Growing up, my parents sacrificed to send me to a parochial school because the local schools did not offer a bi-lingual education and were not well resourced. I was lucky to receive scholarships to offset the costs and allow me to receive a great education. Every child deserves the opportunity to receive a quality education, regardless of their zip code, our schools should be the best resourced in the country. Seniors I BELIEVE IN that our seniors deserve to enjoy life with dignity and with the care they deserve. I BELIEVE IN WE ALL DESERVE the right to age without fear of losing our quality of life. WE ALL DESERVE I saw what aging without adequate resources did to my parents. My mother and father fell into poverty as the cost of living went up and the value of their pension and Social Security payments went down. They could not afford the level of care they deserved and it fell on me and my siblings to help supplement. We were honored to do so, but we should not have to, we work all of our lives and save what we can for retirement with no security that we will be able to retire comfortably. We must fight for cost of living increases for our seniors and ensure they can remain in their homes and not be burdened more and more as the years pass. Energy, Climate, & Environment I BELIEVE IN: We are in a climate crisis, we must act now if we want to leave a livable New York for our children and grandchildren. I BELIEVE IN: WE ALL DESERVE: Clean air, clean water, and a safe waterfront. WE ALL DESERVE: We are one super-storm away from losing our part of the East River Esplanade and the waterfront in the South Bronx which will impact residents. Our air quality is so bad that our Children suffer from one of the highest asthma rates in the state. We must invest in creating a resilient waterfront and working to improve the air quality by increasing investment in green infrastructure across the district. Arts & Innovation I BELIEVE IN the importance of art in the development of strong communities. I BELIEVE IN WE ALL DESERVE access to art education and art space, that includes music, theater, and emerging mediums. WE ALL DESERVE I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship to a well-resourced parochial high school where I was exposed to art and music. Taking a theater class allowed me to work through the anxiety I had due to having a speech impediment. Access to art changed my life. Every student in District 8 deserves access to art and music. Small Business I BELIEVE THAT small businesses are important to building stronger, more resilient communities. I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL DESERVE the freedom and resources to start a business and invest in our communities. WE ALL DESERVE Growing up, my parents owned a bodega, a cornerstone of our community. They eventually lost the business due to rising costs and limited access to resources that could have helped them stay afloat. We need to invest in our small businesses, especially those owned and operated by local community members. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our neighborhoods—every dollar spent in a local business circulates twelve times within the community, strengthening our economy. We must direct funds to ensure our business corridors are clean, safe, and welcoming so that our businesses can thrive and continue enriching our neighborhoods.

Wil LÓpez Democrat For NY City Council  Español  Conozca a Wil Wilfredo “Wil” López tiene una trayectoria inspiradora, arraigada en la perseverancia. Criado en San Sebastián, Puerto Rico, como el menor de 8 hermanos, los padres de Wil trabajaron incansablemente para crear un futuro mejor. Inspirado por la determinación de sus padres y a pesar de tener una discapacidad de aprendizaje no diagnosticada, Wil obtuvo una beca y se convirtió en el primero de su familia en asistir a la universidad. Wil trabajó en el comercio minorista durante más de una década para mantener a su familia, hasta que, a los 33 años, decidió estudiar derecho. Se graduó con honores y se preparó para luchar contra las injusticias en su comunidad. Wil comenzó su carrera legal como fiscal en la oficina del fiscal de distrito de Brooklyn, donde luchó por llevar justicia a la comunidad a la que servía. Como director legislativo en el Concejo Municipal de Nueva York, aprobó 22 piezas legislativas significativas, incluyendo la prohibición de pesticidas cancerígenos en los parques de la ciudad, y cofundó el sindicato del Concejo Municipal, el sindicato municipal independiente más grande de los EE. UU. El liderazgo de Wil como profesional de asuntos gubernamentales le ha permitido abogar de manera efectiva por temas cruciales. Sus esfuerzos llevaron a la aprobación de la ley local 31 de 2023, que reconoce el abuso económico como violencia doméstica. Además, lideró una coalición diversa en Albany, luchando por una causa civil para las sobrevivientes de violencia doméstica que enfrentan deudas forzadas. Su presencia constante en el Ayuntamiento y en Albany, y su compromiso de obtener resultados, han dejado un impacto duradero en las comunidades a las que sirve, lo que le valió ser reconocido como una de las personas más influyentes en relaciones gubernamentales por CITY & STATE en 2023. Durante la pandemia, Wil organizó una huelga de alquileres contra un casero negligente, logrando una victoria legal y la condonación de una deuda considerable, cercana a seis cifras. Wil reside en el distrito con su esposa, Luisa, y su hijo, Lucas Sebastián. Participan activamente como voluntarios en diversas organizaciones sin fines de lucro de la ciudad. Wil también forma parte de la junta directiva de Union Settlement, del Consejo Asesor Comunitario del Hospital Metropolitano, del Comité de Vivienda de la Junta Comunitaria 11, y fue becario del Consejo de Profesionales Urbanos (CUP) y del programa Bridges-NY del Consejo de Relaciones Comunitarias Judías (JCRC).
