Today, I joined community leaders and harm reduction service providers to discuss human centered public health challenges and its impact on the area’s economic development.My Wellness NYC Plan to address the opioid crisis is very clear: I call on Comptroller Brad Lander to address calls of advocates to launch an inquiry into how NYC has been spending over $150M of NYS Opioid Settlement Fund money. The City must immediately deploy resources to on the ground service providers to create multifaceted wellness centers which integrate harm reduction principles. H+H must integrate harm reduction and overdose prevention units as part of their triage to decrease emergency room wait times, save lives, and ensure individuals are connected to competent long term care. Public safety measures must be taken to stop the increase of fentanyl and other illicit drugs in NYC. We must organize providers, agencies, community members, and elected officials for quarterly action meetings with on demand results similar to a modernized COMP Stat System. Implement annual impact audits to measure success tied to dollars and empower results oriented providers. The people of NYC deserve better than our existing broken system. We can clean up our streets, end preventable deaths, and give people their lives back all at the same time.   Join the Mailing List Stay updated with the latest news and events from Michael Blake.

The true cost of living—housing, food, childcare, transportation—continues to rise while wages remain stagnant. Too many families live one emergency away from losing everything.

Reverend and Former Assembly Member Michael Blake believes the city must act now to guarantee dignity, opportunity, and economic security for every New Yorker. Within his first 100 days, Blake will declare a True Cost of Living Emergency and begin the process to launch a Guaranteed Income pilot program in neighborhoods hardest hit by economic insecurity, establishing a public dashboard tracking program outcomes for full transparency and accountability. Blake’s Guaranteed Income plan will provide direct financial support to New Yorkers most impacted by the affordability crisis. This initiative is a central pillar of his broader agenda to stabilize communities, end cycles of poverty, and strengthen working-class opportunity across all five boroughs.

Blake’s Guaranteed Income plan will provide direct financial support to New Yorkers most impacted by the affordability crisis. This initiative is a central pillar of his broader agenda to stabilize communities, end cycles of poverty, and strengthen working-class opportunity across all five boroughs. We will first implement the True Cost of Living study to know the actual economic baseline needed for New Yorkers, including expenses from housing to childcare to groceries, as reviewing the poverty metric alone is insufficient. Rent and childcare are the two main expenses for New Yorkers. Once we understand that data, our pilot will provide an initial 20,000 New Yorkers, determined by the True Cost of Living metric as rent and childcare cost burdened, with the funds to address these costs, capped at $500 to start. Based upon the success of the program and in partnership with city council, state and federal government, we will expand the eligibility pool and increase available funds.

The Guaranteed Income program will be funded without raising taxes on working families. In addition to working with philanthropic partners, funding will come from drawing down from cash reserves given the economic emergency that too many New Yorkers are facing, reallocating funds in the current city budget including but not limited to excessive overtime pay, taxing vacant luxury apartments that remain empty while families search for housing; recovering more than $2 billion in unpaid city fines, fees, and penalties¹; and ending corporate property tax exemptions.

It is about ensuring no New Yorker is priced out, pushed out, or left behind. It is about restoring faith that New York City belongs to everyone who calls it home. His administration will expand Universal Childcare access and replace outdated Area Median Income (AMI) formulas with a Local Median Income (LMI) standard to better reflect real community wages.

Excerpt from Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy at the Democratic Party Dinner, Tucson, Arizona, February 22, 1958 So long as there is one child without milk, so long as there is one family without a decent home, so long as there are aged persons without pensions, working mothers without fair wages, struggling farmers without income, so long as there are overcrowded schools, inadequate hospitals and families on relief, so long will the need for the Democratic Party continue – and so long will we be called upon to assume the responsibilities of leadership.

Blake Fall 2016 Image “In this Obama era of politics, we are at a critical crossroads of the necessity of a race and gender coalition for success in critical elections.  As a former aide to President Obama and current Assemblymember in my hometown of The Bronx, NY, I hope people emerge from our study group entitled, "The Untold story of the Obama era" reflecting about the economic, business and political case for diversity in politics and how they can actively be a part of changing the face and tone of their political structures.” Michael A. Blake is the Assembly member of the 79th District in The Bronx, New York. He is passionate about urban entrepreneurship, Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs), education, community learning, building sustainable communities, equality for all and empowering young men of color. Blake was born and raised in The Bronx, New York to Jamaican immigrants. In early 2007, Michael joined then Sen. Barack Obama’s campaign and served as the Iowa deputy political director and constituency outreach director for the successful Iowa caucuses. After serving as the Michigan deputy state director for the general election, Blake joined the White House staff as the associate director of public engagement and deputy associate director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. He created the White House Urban Entrepreneurship Summit series, which sought to foster public, private and not-for-profit partnerships and provide strategic advice in seven cities across the nation. Blake left the White House to serve as the national deputy director of Operation Vote for President Obama’s 2012 re-election and helped expand the diverse electorate that later re-elected the president, leading to historic turnout among constituencies nationwide. Blake was honored as one of “The Root 100” in 2012, featured in Jet magazine as one of 15 black politicos behind President Obama’s re-election and recognized by MSNBC in 2011 as one of the Top 10 Black politicians on the rise.  Blake has been preaching for the last 21 years as an exhorter in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a Certified Lay Speaker in the United Methodist Church.

He is passionate about urban entrepreneurship, Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs), education, community learning, building sustainable communities, equality for all and empowering young men of color. Blake was born and raised in The Bronx, New York to Jamaican immigrants. In early 2007, Michael joined then Sen. Barack Obama’s campaign and served as the Iowa deputy political director and constituency outreach director for the successful Iowa caucuses. After serving as the Michigan deputy state director for the general election, Blake joined the White House staff as the associate director of public engagement and deputy associate director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. He created the White House Urban Entrepreneurship Summit series, which sought to foster public, private and not-for-profit partnerships and provide strategic advice in seven cities across the nation. Blake left the White House to serve as the national deputy director of Operation Vote for President Obama’s 2012 re-election and helped expand the diverse electorate that later re-elected the president, leading to historic turnout among constituencies nationwide. Blake was honored as one of “The Root 100” in 2012, featured in Jet magazine as one of 15 black politicos behind President Obama’s re-election and recognized by MSNBC in 2011 as one of the Top 10 Black politicians on the rise.  Blake has been preaching for the last 21 years as an exhorter in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a Certified Lay Speaker in the United Methodist Church.

New Yorkers clearly do not feel that their lives are getting better under his administration. Whether it be loss of funds in their pocket or loss of hope and trust, it is hard to see how the city moves forward given the current mayor. Rev. Michael Blake Michael Blake, a former New York State assemblyman from the Bronx and a veteran of the Obama administration, is entering the crowded race to unseat Mayor Eric Adams. He is the seventh prominent candidate to challenge Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was indicted in September on federal corruption charges . Mr. Blake created an exploratory committee on Friday and put up a campaign website on Sunday. In his first interview as a mayoral candidate, Mr. Blake said that his campaign would focus on addressing the high cost of living in New York City and quality of life issues. “New Yorkers clearly do not feel that their lives are getting better under his administration,” he said. “Whether it be loss of funds in their pocket or loss of hope and trust, it is hard to see how the city moves forward given the current mayor.” Mr. Blake, 41, a former vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, served in the State Assembly for six years and in the Obama White House for two years. Many of the candidates who are running in the Democratic primary in June are to the left of Mr. Adams, most more so than Mr. Blake. He said that he had implemented both progressive and moderate policies and viewed himself as a “responsible leader who is finding solutions in the middle.” As mayor, he said that he would support policies such as universal child care and paying nonprofits faster. Other candidates, including former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, could enter the mayoral race in the coming months. Mr. Blake said that he was also considering running for a leadership role at the Democratic National Committee as the party searches for a path forward following the victory of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Mr. Blake ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2020, losing to Representative Ritchie Torres in the Democratic primary. A year earlier, he finished fourth among 17 candidates in a special election for New York City public advocate, a race won by Jumaane Williams . Mr. Blake will have to move quickly to raise money for the race and to reintroduce himself to voters across the city. Mr. Blake, whose parents are from Jamaica, plans to highlight his working-class biography and his roots in the Bronx. His father was a maintenance worker at a hospital, he said, and his mother worked at a manufacturing plant. He said that he was proud of his work as a state lawmaker on issues such as the “Raise the Age” law that stopped 16- and 17-year-olds from being tried as adults in criminal court. He received scrutiny for accepting and then declining a job at a political consulting firm while serving in the Legislature. Since leaving office, he has worked as a political consultant, runs a nonprofit and serves as an associate pastor at a church in the Bronx. Mr. Blake, who worked on the Obama campaign in 2012, said that he had not talked to the former president about running for mayor. He said he was still friendly with Mr. Obama and spoke with him in October for a “Win With Black Men” event for Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. Brian Cunningham, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, said that Mr. Blake would be a great candidate for mayor and had made “meaningful investments in underserved communities.” “He understands how to lift everyone around him,” he said.

Facebook Pinterest WhatsApp X LinkedIn Email Reverend Michael Blake, a proud son of Jamaican immigrants, is in the race to become the next mayor of New York City. With a background in public service and a commitment to uplifting marginalised communities, Blake’s campaign focuses on key issues such as affordable housing, economic growth, and education. Here are eight things to know about the candidate who hopes to lead the Big Apple in 2025. Our family went from no house in Jamaica to the Black house at Northwestern, from The White House in D.C. to the state House in Albany. Now, our job is to help everyone in your house to realize your dreams. – Rev. Michael Blake 1. A Bronx Native with Strong Jamaican Roots Born and raised in the Bronx to Jamaican parents, Michael Blake grew up in a household that valued hard work, resilience, and community service. He often credits his upbringing for shaping his political career, instilling in him the belief that leadership should be about lifting others up, not just holding office. 2. A Seasoned Public Servant Blake served three terms in the New York State Assembly, representing the 79th District in the Bronx. During his tenure, he focused on economic empowerment, small business support, and criminal justice reform. His work aimed at creating fairer opportunities for low-income families and underprivileged communities. 3. A Former Obama White House Official Blake’s experience extends beyond New York politics—he was part of the Obama-Biden administration, serving as the Associate Director of Public Engagement. In this role, he worked on policies supporting minority and women-owned businesses, helping to drive economic equity initiatives at the national level. 4. A Bold Plan for Affordable Housing One of Blake’s key campaign promises is tackling New York City’s housing crisis. He has proposed a Mitchell-Lama 2.0 programme, aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing units and making rent and homeownership more accessible. His plan also includes removing credit score barriers that prevent many New Yorkers from securing housing. 5. Champion for Education and Youth Development Believing that education is the gateway to opportunity, Blake has pledged to increase funding for public schools, expand higher education access for underserved communities, and fully fund universal childcare. His goal is to break generational cycles of poverty by ensuring young people have the tools to succeed. 6. Focused on Economic Growth and Fair Wages Blake is advocating for guaranteed income programmes to support working-class New Yorkers and has pledged to raise wages, particularly for childcare and homecare workers. His economic strategy centres on supporting small businesses and making New York’s economy more inclusive. 7. A National Political Figure Blake has played a significant role in national politics. From 2017 to 2021, he served as Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), where he worked on voter mobilisation and outreach efforts across the country. His leadership on a national stage has given him insight into policymaking at every level of government. 8. A Faith-Driven Leader An ordained minister, Blake speaks openly about the role of faith in leadership. He believes that restoring trust and integrity in government is crucial and has positioned his mayoral run as an opportunity to bring values-based leadership to New York City. As the 2025 mayoral race heats up, Michael Blake is making a strong case for why he should lead the city. With a track record spanning local, state, and national politics—and a deep commitment to economic justice and community empowerment—his campaign is one to watch.

This beginning probably explains his foundation of faith, politics and putting his heart and soul into all opportunities. When describing the path his life has taken, Michael Blake humbly refers to the words of his mother who remarked that the family had gone, “from no house to the White House.” Blake has committed himself to public service and to the empowerment of others like him, who may not have direct access to opportunities to participate in the policy and political debates that shape this nation. Blake’s family story is a testament to his achievement. His family emigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica seeking new opportunities, but facing many new challenges. Michael faced challenges in the quality of his education – his New York City elementary school, P.S. 79, is featured in Jonathan Kozol’s Savage Inequalities: Children in America’s Schools yet still rose to graduate from Northwestern University – making his story all the more remarkable. Blake currently is the National Senior Consultant for Green For All, the leading voice for green jobs for communities of color, while also doing governmental, political and constituency outreach consulting. He recently served as the Campaign Manager for Reshma Saujani’s campaign for New York City Public Advocate Previously, Michael served as the Senior Advisor for the Office of Public Engagement for President Obama’s 2013 Presidential Inaugural Committee. Prior to that appointment, he served as the National Deputy Director of Operation Vote for President Obama’s 2012 re-election, the constituency outreach program for the Obama for America campaign and helped expand the diverse electorate who voted for President Obama. But before the national opportunities, Blake’s path to public service is a testament of what happens if you just trust in your dreams, anything can be possible. While an Associate Producer in Chicago, Blake felt that he was not helping people in the ways he should be at the time. So, he interned twice a week for former State Senator Jeff Schoenberg (D – Evanston, Illinois). One day, a woman walked in need as she was at risk of losing her home and only having a week to get the help. Because of what Michael witnessed from his humble beginnings, he and the team worked diligently to help the woman, she kept her home, returned to say thank you and then Michael knew that his path was clear – it was to serve the people. He considered several opportunities, but it was when Henry Tamarin (President, UNITE Here in Chicago) told Michael of the “Yes We Can” program that everything changed. Blake first met President Obama in 2006 when he joined the Obama organization as a participant in the “Yes We Can” political training program, which trained ten young Americans to run and execute a political campaign. Blake maintains that Obama was the same caring, intellectual and transformational individual at their first meeting that he is today as President and encouraged him to think beyond his present circumstance saying, “Michael, Dream Big Dreams”. Blake started his political career in Michigan, where he successfully co-organized three state house campaigns in the 2006 election cycle and was promoted to become the Director of External Affairs for the Michigan House of Representatives serving in Michigan Speaker of the House Andy Dillon’s cabinet,. His affiliation with Obama would continue through the 2008 Obama for America campaign, in which Blake worked in eight states over 20 months, starting as the Iowa Deputy Political Director and Constituency Outreach Director and ending as the Michigan Deputy Director and Political Director. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, a 2007 Time Magazine said, “Michael Blake may have more to do with Barack Obama’s chances of becoming President than anyone besides the candidate himself.” Blake humbly disagrees. Following the campaign, Blake joined the White House staff as Associate Director of Public Engagement & Deputy Associate Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, coordinating African American, Minority Business and county and statewide elected official outreach. He created the White House Urban Entrepreneurship Summit series, which sought to foster public, private and not-for-profit partnerships and provide strategic advice to attendees. Blake was honored as one of “The Root 100” in 2012; featured in Jet magazine as one of 15 black politicos behind President Obama’s re-election; and recognized by MSNBC in 2011 as one of the Top 10 Black Politicians on the rise. The Bronx, New York native is a graduate of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He is also an Exhorter in the African Methodist Episcopal church and a member of Allen Chapel AME church in Washington, D.C. with the Rev. Dr. Michael E. Bell, Sr. as pastor. Michael Blake often paraphrases his favorite scripture of Romans 8:18 and the words of Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick by saying “in 2008, we changed the guard; but in 2012, we guard the change.” Blake’s life has been dedicated to that charge and his hope is that history will forever know that the change has been guarded.
