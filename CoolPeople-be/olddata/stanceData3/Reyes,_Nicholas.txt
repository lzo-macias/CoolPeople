the new memoir from Nicolas Reyes In Becoming A King , international music great Nicolas Reyes shares his captivating journey from the gritty, itinerant life of a gypsy to international stardom. Store Featured   Quick View Quick View Quick View TOUR ABOUT has been the leader and co-founder of the Gipsy Kings for well over 30 years. In the past three decades, they have dominated the World Music charts and sold more than 14 million albums worldwide. Their platinum compilation, The Best of the Gipsy Kings , was charting for over a year upon its release and their ninth studio album, Savor Flamenco , was awarded the Grammy for Best World Music Album in 2013.

When the pair parted ways, the elder Reyes became even more popular upon starting his own band, backed by his son, called Los Reyes. In later years, Nicolas headed out on his own and began playing in the town of Arles in the south of France. He traveled throughout the country, busking on the streets of Saint-Tropez, playing wherever he could. Having adopted the perpetual motion of the gypsy lifestyle, his band eventually translated “Los Reyes” and became the Gipsy Kings. The band’s music went on to fuse with popular culture. In addition to the accolades above, the traveling Gipsy Kings have played some of the world’s greatest stages, from the Hollywood Bowl to Royal Albert Hall as well as hitting the big screen. Their rendition of “Hotel California” was included in the film The Big Lebowski and the HBO series Entourage . The 2010 film Toy Story 3 featured a Gipsy Kings version of the movie’s popular, Randy Newman-penned theme, “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”. The Gipsy Kings recently featured in a Big Lebowski spinoff The Jesus Rolls with Reyes appearing in person with the director and star, John Turturro, for some of the promotion.

It’s who we are,” says Nicolas Reyes. “But I think there will be a time when we pass down the Gipsy Kings to our sons”. 30 years is an eternity in pop music but the story of the Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes has the depth to endure. Theirs is a music that extends through generations, to the sounds of their ancestors—Spanish Romani people who fled the Catalonia region during the Spanish Civil War—and reflects the vibrantly eclectic and peripatetic history of the gitanos.

Donate Today ! Donate Today !  about me Rooted in the Community, Committed to Change I am not a career politician nor do I want to be one. The current political landscape is ugly and full of hate, which is counterproductive if we are looking for a real change. The reason I am running to be the City Council Member for the 8th District is to break this long-standing pattern of empty promises and to give us a fighting chance to live comfortably in our community. I do not owe anyone anything which means I’ll be able to represent the 8th district honestly and with integrity which has not been the case in a long time. South Bronx and East Harlem are facing a lot of the same issues and if we do not elect people with integrity we will continue to lose our communities and be forced out. I was born in East Harlem and lived in New Metro Houses on First Avenue. My Mother Worked in Metropolitan Hospital. My father was born and raised in East Harlem living in Lexington Houses. My grandmother is from Lexington Housing. I played baseball with the East Harlem Little League and Boricua All-Star League. I went to Wagner Pool every summer. I marched in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. I went to the Children’s Aid Society. I went to the Boys Club on 111th Street. I went to elementary school a St. Francis Academy.
