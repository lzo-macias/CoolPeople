She knows that the odds are stacked against everyday New Yorkers and has first-hand experience building strong and effective coalitions with people who may not always agree. As a former Verizon Wireless worker, Bianca led her coworkers in 7 stores across Brooklyn, NY to form a union together and join CWA in 2014, making them the first unionized retail workers in the company. She later led her coworkers on a 49 day strike to secure their first contract for higher wages, flexible scheduling, and benefits. Verizon fired her for organizing, and during the Verizon strike, picketers across the country chanted âBring Back Bianca!â Bianca was on the bargaining team to help secure their first contract for stores in Brooklyn as well as a store in Massachusetts. Bianca has shown that she has the political courage we need in this moment to represent the 41st district and  stand with the many to fight for a New York that is clean, safe, and affordable for all. A New York that prioritizes the dignity of our retirees, essential workers and public servants is possible. I pledge to fight corruption and special interests conspiring to diminish the great promise of this city and our democracy.â Your donation could be matched 8:1 Bianca has never accepted donations from corporations, LLCs, or dark money PACs. Our campaign is fueled by grassroots donors like you. Thanks to the NYC Campaign Finance Program, donations up to $250 from New York City residents could be matched 8:1 with city funds. $25 $100 $250 $500 $2100 OTHER What Qualifies Me? I led the fight to organize the 7 Verizon Wireless retail stores across Brooklyn making us the first in the country to join Communication Workers of America I helped to organize the largest retail strike in the country with AT&T Mobility workers I supported the fight against turning the Bedford Union Armory into luxury housing. Recipient of CWA local 1109 SHERO award presented by Tisch James in 2015. I worked in coalition with Communities United for Police Reform to pass  the Right to Know Act I worked to train and support hundreds of workers around the city to unionize and improve their working conditions I helped develop the campaign for postal banking with APWU canvassing banking deserts like the Bronx and Brooklyn I founded the AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color caucus and grew it to be national with caucuses in over 6 states Established AfroSocialists chapters on 3  HBCU campuses Partnered with Organizing for Equity to develop a campaign  that reduced the number of days for school suspensions for public school students in NYC. I also supported the trades during the #CountMeIn fight which was a multitiered fight to ensure the Hudson Yards was built 100% union and to stop the discrimination and villainization of formerly incarcerated workers on the job site. I mentored high school and middle school students and developed anti capitalist political science curriculum to present in classrooms around the city Organized and AfroSocialist weekend long convention that included organizing 101 and historical content for 50 Black and brown activists across the city at Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung Hosted a panel on Gentrification that featured tenant organizers from Brooklyn that discussed gentrification I was a keynote speaker for an event to commemorate Brazilian activist Marielle Franco held by Mulheres da ResistÃªncia no Exterior Testified and organized with public hospital workers in Harlem Hospital to stop the closure Guest lecturer at CUNY graduate school on political engagement and power mapping Organized mutual aid health and wellness events in Crown Heights Organized a march in support of Eric Garnerâs family looking  to hold Daniel Pantaleo charged with murder Helped to organize a press conference at City Hall in response to the murder of Saheed Vassell Has had writings about racial justice, politics and labor published in major media publications I was one of the core organizers that called for the occupation of City Hall Park in 2020 to pressure the council to vote for fully funded public services and reducing the NYPD  budget. Guest lecturer at Harvard Business School on bargaining for the common good Platform Public Education Fully funded public schools Ensuring all schools in the district can serve as community schools. Community schools are schools that consider the whole child and family. These schools have wraparound services like optometrists and dentists in house as well as mental health providers. These schools also have things for the community like workforce development programs, adult learning and resources for housing assistance.  The surrounding community including parents, local organizations and community mentes get a say in the curriculum and what services are offered. Brownsville was the site of one of the fist fights for community control of schools on the country after the Ocean Hill Brownsville teacher strike in 1965. Culturally Relevant Curriculum In a time where our federal government is trying erase all of our collective progress andÂ  our history itâs important that the curriculum is teaching our TRUE history as well as preparing students to thrive in the real world whether they choose toÂ go to college or not. Thatâs why I support fully funding programs that expose students to professions like nursing teaching and law. We need to bring the trades back into the school and we can also partner with community organizations to have programs like STEM, music and the arts and Earth sciences in all schools Fund Participatory Budgeting Participatory projects should be funded for each school. These projects teach democracy, budgets and project management for the collective. They also prep the students to participate in community and civic engagement. Invest in Restorative Justice We can experience with models  that have been successful in other states like Dads on Duty where father and big brother figures have a presence in the school normally after instances of violence. Their presence not only reduces violence but also improves communication between students and educators and increases morale overall. We need to invest in teaching students conflict resolution and ensuring that there are behavioral specialists present everyday in every school. Labor and Workforce Development Workforce Development – Brownsville has an unemployment rate of almost 30%, the highest in the city. We know that development has to happen in Brownsville and I support development of sustainable, affordable housing. I want to build with union labor and offer local folks a pathway to becoming union members by expanding apprenticeship programs. Brownsville has one of the highest unemployment rates in the city I want to see more young people and public housing residents trained to get good paying union jobs by expanding apprenticeship programs,  bringing trades back into schools and funding re entry programs for returning citizens Essential Workers Make Our City Run! I will fight to make sure these workers have higher wages, better safety standards and the benefits they deserve. New York is a Union Town! I want to ensure we hold bad bosses accountable and make it easier for workers to join unions and negotiate good contracts. I will fight to build affordable housing with 100% union labor and regulate AI so that those jobs stay with hard working New Yorkers. Learn More Expanding Apprenticeship Programs for local residents Re-Entry programs for returning citizens Building 100% Union Green Jobs Local Hiring metrics tied to all new projects and businesses in the district Building new development 100% affordable according to the neighborhood  local median household income NOT t he AMI Healthy Communities I believe that our sense of safety is tied directly to our health outcomes and our environment. That means we need to invest in the following: 24-7 Mobile crisis units as first responders  non-violent 9-1-1 calls More Green spaces Supporting the call for universal child care specifically addressing parents with non traditional work schedules Investing in Community Healing Circles Fulfilling the Brownsville Mandate by funding and expanding the existing violence interruption organizations Funding Mental Health clinics Funding supplemental cleaning services that hire formerly incarcerated or homeless folks like ACE, CTE Fully Funded Public hospitals Reopening psychiatric beds in public hospitals Retrofitting Buildings and homes to make them more energy efficient Reopening cooling centers that have been shut down by Adams Funding  DSNY mobile litter patrols Housing is a Human Right I support the Rent Freeze Building new developments as 100% affordable according to the neighborhood  local median household income NOT the AMI Holding Slumlords accountable for their negligence Our Seniors Should Retire with Dignity I will work to protect pensions and expand funding to foreclosure prevention programs that support seniors at risk of deed or equity theft. I will also support expanding programs that help seniors on limited budgets stay in their homes.
