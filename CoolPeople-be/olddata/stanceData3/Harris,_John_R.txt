	 discounts, and uninsured discounts. The counselors can provide you with

	 for medical items and services. You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected
	 cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs
	 like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and hospital fees. Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in
	 writing at least 1 business day before your medical service or item. You
	 can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose,
	 for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service. If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate,
	 you can dispute the bill. Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.

	 writing at least 1 business day before your medical service or item. You

	 by completing an estimate in the Price Transparency Tool, Using the Price
	 Transparency File, or calling our facility financial counselor by phone
	 or in person. Financial Counselor Contact Information: Methodist Dallas – (214) 947-3422 Financial counselors are available free of charge to answer any questions
	 you may have about your health insurance benefits, insurance contracted
	 discounts, and uninsured discounts. The counselors can provide you with
	 a written estimate which details individual charges from the chargemaster,
	 insurance or uninsured discounts and patient portion due for tests, surgeries
	 or inpatient stays, or you can click on the Patient Estimate Tool to produce your own estimate. Estimates are based on information provided by you (the patient) and do
	 not include additional tests/procedures/services ordered by your physician
	 after the initial estimate or post unforeseen complications, or physician
	 charges which are billed separately by your physician. Uninsured Patient Rights: Good Faith Estimate You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining
	 how much your medical care will cost. Under the law, health care providers need to give patients who don’t
	 have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill
	 for medical items and services. You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected
	 cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs
	 like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and hospital fees. Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in
	 writing at least 1 business day before your medical service or item. You
	 can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose,
	 for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service. If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate,
	 you can dispute the bill. Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.
