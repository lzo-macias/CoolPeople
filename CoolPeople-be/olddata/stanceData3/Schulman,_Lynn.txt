HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT I believe that healthcare is a human right. The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest healthcare crisis of our lifetimes. Tragically, the Coronavirus exposed the deep vulnerability of our community. Over the past two decades, Queens has lost an alarming number of hospitals and other healthcare resources. The consequences have been devastating. We have lost loved ones, friends, and neighbors. The lives lost underscore that there is nothing more important than access to healthcare – which is why l have been fighting to ensure that Queens will be underserved no more. Once reelected as your City Council Member, I will continue to push for legislation that will require all development projects under land use review to include a hospital impact assessment in addition to the required environmental assessment. This will ensure that communities like Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill, and Rego Park have enough hospital beds for emergency care when it is more critical. Not only are we in desperate need of additional hospital capacity, but we need a healthcare system that can provide affordable preventive and primary care, and also have the ability to react to acute issues such as COVID-19. “Queens has lost an alarming number of hospitals.” As Chair of the City Council Health Committee and as someone who has had first-hand experience working in the healthcare field, I have moved these issues to the forefront to ensure our lives aren’t put in jeopardy because of the government’s inability to make smart decisions about our public health, and will continue to do so once reelected. Save lives by building essential hospital capacity in Queens Save lives by building essential hospital capacity in Queens Force all land use decisions to have a health care impact assessment Force all land use decisions to have a health care impact assessment Invest in preventive and primary care by making community health services more accessible for seniors and low income residents Invest in preventive and primary care by making community health services more accessible for seniors and low income residents Increase the funding, and expand the mandate of, the Department of Health to better prevent disease outbreaks and improve public health Increase the funding, and expand the mandate of, the Department of Health to better prevent disease outbreaks and improve public health Contact the Campaign Manager at: sara@lynnschulman.com Paid for by Lynn for NYC 2023

THE RIGHT TO A SECURE RETIREMENT AND SUPPORTING OUR SENIORS It is unacceptable that in the wealthiest city in the history of the world that thousands of seniors are living in poverty. We must protect the most vulnerable in this community and make sure they have access to the help they need. Our senior citizens deserve to live with dignity and support. COVID-19 exposed the lack of adequate services for our senior population. District 29 has one of the highest concentrations of seniors in the city – with real needs for affordable housing and healthcare services, including mental health, as well as those struggling with food insecurity. “Our senior citizens deserve to live with dignity and support.” As a City Council Member, I have been working to expand Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), and increase services to our senior centers, which provide vital and enriched programming that includes comprehensive social services for this vulnerable group. Additionally, I will continue to work with the relevant government agencies on a comprehensive senior safety agenda that addresses the issues of elder abuse and multiple scams that have targeted our senior citizens since the pandemic.

INVEST IN OUR SCHOOLS Our children only get one shot at a great education. Sadly, the coronavirus pandemic took a tremendous toll on our children's learning. Moving forward, we need to afford parents and teachers alike the support they need to ensure all students are given every opportunity to succeed. First, New York City needs to expand its 3-K program throughout the city. We need to demand reduced class sizes, which have been proven to improve learning. We must also invest in daily physical education which in addition to its health benefits, also yields better learning. We have flagrantly ignored physical education since the pandemic began. Also critical is the investment in our schools’ dual language programs. Studies show that bilingual students have increased cognitive development, better academic achievement, and increased economic opportunities. We must end school segregation. It is shameful that NYC is the most segregated school district in the nation.  Our children only get one shot at a great education. We must ensure every child, regardless of zip code, gets an excellent public education. The future of our society depends on it. We must confront this issue head-on and work to build integrated schools in every neighborhood. “We must ensure every child gets an excellent public education.” In the most diverse city in the world, we should ensure language is not a barrier to a quality public education. It’s important to expand gifted and talented programs to all local elementary schools. Speaking with parents, educators, and the kids themselves will be critical to ensuring everyone has a voice in this important aspect of their education. all Lastly, we need a multi-year plan to achieve integration in our public schools. We can implement careful planning to confront segregation in middle schools which created a comprehensive integration plan by listening to parents and educators in every community.

COMMUNITY SAFETY I do not support a jail in Kew Gardens. I believe our community should have a say in whatever happens in our district. The criminal justice system is in a state of crisis. I understand that people are fearful and angry. Jails like Rikers Island should never happen again. I support community-based restorative justice. The primary purpose of justice in the restorative model is to both reduce crime and to repair the harm of the crime to whatever degree possible. We need to change the relationship between the corrections system and the community. The restorative justice framework calls for the inclusion of all stakeholders, especially victims and community members. Our community deserves a voice in the process and the ability to shape what happens here. You can always count on me to be honest with you and to represent our best interests.

Disability Rights I have long been a champion for all underprivileged groups from LGBTQIA+ communities to people with disabilities. I have especially long supported the inclusion of people with disabilities in the political and social fabric of society. There are four basic tenants of fair treatment for disabled people that I believe in. 1. Freedom of movement Architectural accessibility — in homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, businesses, and all public buildings and spaces.

CLIMATE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL — WE MUST ACT NOW We are facing a once-in-a-civilization challenge to save our planet from destruction within. New York City must be a leader in adapting to meet the realities of climate change and address the needs of our broken infrastructure to create millions of jobs. We have an opportunity to both stop climate change and create millions of good-paying jobs in the process. Prior to being elected to the City Council, I was an environmental advocate for over thirty years and understand how existential this threat is to our future and our present.  We must seize this moment in history and create change on the local level. “We have an opportunity to both stop climate change and create millions of good-paying jobs in the process.” I developed a plan to transform our city to meet this challenge, which will move us towards a more sustainable, more just future. My plan includes: Create an electric grid that is powered by 100% renewable energy by 2030 Create an electric grid that is powered by 100% renewable energy by 2030 Transition the entire vehicle fleet of all NYC agencies towards zero emissions by 2030 Transition the entire vehicle fleet of all NYC agencies towards zero emissions by 2030 Aggressive time-tables to convert all polluting buildings to clean energy by 2030 Aggressive time-tables to convert all polluting buildings to clean energy by 2030 Phase out gas fired power plants in Queens and replace with renewable sources of energy by 2040 Phase out gas fired power plants in Queens and replace with renewable sources of energy by 2040 Rapidly expand the amount of green space within District 29 by 2030 by re-engineering our streets to be more efficient including reducing asphalt and concrete wherever possible Rapidly expand the amount of green space within District 29 by 2030 by re-engineering our streets to be more efficient including reducing asphalt and concrete wherever possible Increase funding for Queens parks and advance Phase I of the Queensway project, a community-led effort to transform a blighted, 3.5 mile stretch of abandoned railway in Central Queens into a family-friendly linear park and cultural greenway Increase funding for Queens parks and advance Phase I of the Queensway project, a community-led effort to transform a blighted, 3.5 mile stretch of abandoned railway in Central Queens into a family-friendly linear park and cultural greenway Contact the Campaign Manager at: sara@lynnschulman.com Paid for by Lynn for NYC 2023

LGBTQ+ PLATFORM I came out as a lesbian before it was socially acceptable and I experienced the struggles that came with it. I have been an advocate for my community ever since, and I will continue to do so by fighting against stigma, health disparities, discrimination for sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. We have the right to be heard, share our ideas, and be counted by our society. As a member of the City Council and Chair of the Health Committee, I have worked tirelessly on healthcare disparities in our community and advocated to support and maintain the visibility of my Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Gender non-conforming, and Queer colleagues and employees. Legislation: As a member of the Council, I have supported legislation for the collection of information on sexual orientation and gender identity by city agencies during the hiring process, and for the Department of Education to continue and expand their LGBTQ+ curriculum in our public schools. In addition, I am fighting for the creation of a Citywide LGBTQ+ Office that will ensure - no matter the administration - the LGBTQ+ community has representation. I will also continue to advocate with the New York State Legislature to pass legislation that expands and protects the rights of all LGBTQ+ individuals. Budget: Through budget allocations I will continue to support the important LGBTQ+ organizations and service providers in District 29 and will advocate for the expansion and funding of initiatives for programs that provide direct services, healthcare, housing and education opportunities for LGBTQ+ children, youth and seniors throughout the city. “I came out as a lesbian before it was socially acceptable…We have the right to be heard, share our ideas, and be counted by our society.” Contact the Campaign Manager at: sara@lynnschulman.com Paid for by Lynn for NYC 2023

Jobs and Small Business The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the world economy and here in New York City, it is sending bedrock industries into a tailspin.  The city’s 4.7 million private-sector jobs as of December have been cut drastically and even as our City and State governments struggle to grapple with budget impacts, it is expected that commerce and employment will be the collateral damage of this health crisis, with a real impact on communities. As Council Member,I have tirelessly advocated to ensure that we have a City budget and policy priorities that focus on rebuilding our communities. I have worked with our local small businesses, who are the backbone of our economy, to ensure that they can continue to thrive in our neighborhoods. “We must have a City budget that focuses on rebuilding our communities.” As Council Member, I have organized local small businesses and will continue to address the issue of burdensome regulations that are affecting them and crippling our economy. I believe that the government should not only be effective, but also transparent, and am working to deepen my relationship with the small business community so they can have input on the decisions that impact their future.  At the same time, I am fighting for smart development in the district that ensures adequate infrastructure such as hospitals, transportation, schools, supermarkets, etc. – and fight over-development that does not address the needs of the new population these projects bring to the community.

FIX THE MTA AND BUILD SAFE STREETS Mobility is a fundamental part of making our city function for everyone. For too long, our public transportation options have been overcrowded, unreliable, and inaccessible. Now, as NYC recovers from the pandemic, it is crucially important that we address the challenges plaguing our mass transit system once and for all. The ability of our community and our city to get back on its feet, depends on it. Our public health depends on it. It means expanding bus service instead of curtailing it. It means making every MTA station accessible to people with disabilities, the elderly, and parents with strollers. It means treating MTA service in Queens as an integrated system where LIRR fares are affordable to the communities they run through. In addition, we need to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety by bringing together members of our community and other stakeholders in favor of smart solutions to make better use of our streets. “Only through a comprehensive approach to mobility can we move forward” We need better parking management, including the expansion of residential parking permits to all our neighborhoods. Only through a comprehensive approach can we move forward toward a future that offers every alternative for people to move about reliably, safely and conveniently. Expand Bus Service, especially rapid bus transit like Select Bus Service in our community Expand Bus Service, especially rapid bus transit like Select Bus Service in our community Reduced LIRR fares for New York City residents Reduced LIRR fares for New York City residents Prioritize Pedestrian and Cyclist safety in all street redesigns Prioritize Pedestrian and Cyclist safety in all street redesigns Improve parking management with expansion of residential parking permits Improve parking management with expansion of residential parking permits Push for city take-over of MTA to put subways and buses under municipal control Push for city take-over of MTA to put subways and buses under municipal control Contact the Campaign Manager at: sara@lynnschulman.com Paid for by Lynn for NYC 2023
