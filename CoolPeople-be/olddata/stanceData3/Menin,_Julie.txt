Census Census  311 Search all NYC.gov websites 311 Search all NYC.gov websites  Search  Home About What's at Stake Get Involved Resources Partners Press   About the Director About the Director Contact Us      Print About Director Julie Menin As an attorney and civic leader with over two decades of experience in the legal, regulatory, and public sectors, Julie Menin serves as the Director of NYC Census 2020 and as Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel at the NYC Law Department. She has led three New York City agencies including serving as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs (a prosecutorial agency with a staff of 500.) In her current role as NYC Census Director, she is responsible for ensuring that New York City receives its fair share of over $650 billion in federal funding allocated nationwide as well as fighting attempts to undercount immigrant communities. This task is critical given that the City’s self-response rate to the Census in 2010 was 61.9%. In her senior role at the New York City Law Department, she develops cases in which the federal government or fraudulent corporations are taking actions that harm New Yorkers. She most recently helped bring a lawsuit charging 22 national e-cigarette sellers with deceptively marketing and selling their product to minors. She also participated in a historic win at the U.S. Supreme Court on defeating the federal government’s effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Menin previously served as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, where she reinvigorated the agency by increasing consumer restitution by 70 percent, instituting 25 reforms to lower fines on small businesses where there was no consumer harm, implementing the Paid Sick Leave law, and launching trailblazing legal investigations into for-profit colleges, debt collectors, banks, predatory lenders and other industries preying on New Yorkers. She also settled the largest case in the agency’s history providing consumer relief to over 5,000 New Yorkers and initiated a groundbreaking fuel fraud case with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office resulting in the indictment of nine companies and 44 defendants. She also launched a new Earned Income Tax Credit initiative that resulted in over $260 million being returned to low income New Yorkers. Moreover, Menin created a new city initiative to seed over 10,000 kindergarteners with a college savings account and chaired the board of New York City Kids Rise, a not-for-profit organization charged with implementing this program. Menin also previously served as Commissioner of Media and Entertainment where she implemented dozens of initiatives to increase gender equity. Faced with industries that were not diversified and lacked gender equity, Menin launched new programs to increase women’s representation and opportunities in film, TV, theater, and the music industry. These programs have been held up as a national model and utilized as a paradigm for other cities. Menin also negotiated the deal to bring the Grammy Awards back to New York in 2017, resulting in a $200 million economic benefit for New York City. She previously served as a seven-year Chair of Manhattan Community Board 1 and is widely credited with helping to lead Lower Manhattan’s resurgence after 9/11.  Several weeks after 9/11, she founded the not-for-profit organization Wall Street Rising, which focused on the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan and developed it into an organization with over 30,000 members. As Chairperson of Community Board 1, she facilitated the building of three new schools in Lower Manhattan, new parks, and affordable housing, and led the charge in favor of the Islamic Cultural Center and mosque downtown. As an outspoken advocate for New York City, she unearthed that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a board she previously served on, was hiring a fraudulent contractor for the Deutsche Bank deconstruction and sitting on over $150 million of funds belonging to the community. Menin has also successfully implemented legislation at the city and state level, including winning a two-year battle to mandate life-saving epi-pens on all ambulances statewide. Menin previously practiced law as a regulatory and litigation attorney at one of the nation’s largest law firms in Washington, D.C. and served as Senior Counsel at a Fortune 500 Company. She has served on the boards of the Women’s Campaign Fund, where she helped launch She Should Run, a nationwide initiative that has encouraged thousands of women to run for elected office, and Eleanor’s Legacy, a statewide organization in New York focused on electing more Democratic women statewide. In addition, she has served on the boards of the Downtown Hospital, the Municipal Arts Society, and currently serves on the boards of Vera Institute of Justice’s Reform Leadership Council, the September 11th Memorial Foundation and the WTC Performing Arts Center. She served as an adjunct professor of law and public policy at Columbia University and serves on the board of trustees of Columbia, from which she graduated magna cum laude. Menin has been recognized as a Women’s Campaign Fund’s Rising Star, Citizen Union’s Civic Leader, City and State’s “40 Under 40”, “Power 100 Women” and “Top 25 Women in Public Service”.  She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including Columbia University’s John Jay award and the League of Conservation Voters Public Service award. She has served as a frequent national commentator on law and politics and has appeared nationally on CNN, The Today Show, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and other outlets and previously hosted and co-produced a NBC cable news show focused on politics and law.

Menu   Text Size   Search Search  Primary Navigation The official website of NYC Home NYC Resources NYC311 Office of the Mayor Events Connect Jobs Secondary Navigation      Print Mayor de Blasio Announces Julie Menin as Director of the Census for NYC and Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic Advocacy January 2, 2019 January 2, 2019 NEW YORK–– Mayor Bill de Blasio today appointed Julie  Menin as Director of the Census for New York City. She also will serve as Executive  Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic Advocacy. In her new roles, Menin  will organize extensive outreach efforts to encourage every New York City  resident to participate in the upcoming 2020 Census. An accurate census count  will ensure that New York receives its fair share of education, healthcare,  housing and infrastructure funding and its proper electoral representation in  Congress. As Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic  Advocacy, Menin has been tasked to aggressively pursue innovative strategies to  protect New Yorkers who may be hurt by federal actions, including exploring  avenues for litigation, legislation and rule-making. In this role, she will  collaborate with partners including other cities and advocacy groups to change  the legal landscape on a wide range of issues from immigrant rights and  citizenship, to voter protections, gerrymandering and critical federal funding  grants directed toward the City and our most vulnerable New Yorkers. In  addition, she will use her many years of legal experience in consumer  protection to advise on affirmative litigation against companies that are  preying on New Yorkers. “Julie Menin has been able to get the job done very  effectively in every single role she’s held,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio .  “From her time chairing Community Board 1 to her outstanding work leading two  city agencies, Julie has been able to leverage government, legal and the not  for profit and private sectors to put low-income New Yorkers, small businesses  and marginalized communities first. I’m confident Julie will help protect New  York from the Trump Administration’s attacks on a fair census effort and help  build confidence among all New York City communities so that every New Yorker  participates in the upcoming 2020 Census.” “Having an accurate count of the population is vital for a  fair share and distribution of resources and equitable political  representation, especially under a federal administration consistently  attacking immigrants. We must all work together and ensure that every New  Yorker is counted in the Census 2020,” said Council Speaker Corey Johnson . “Nothing is more important for a fair distribution of  resources and access to economic opportunities in our democratic society than  making sure everyone is counted by the census,” said Deputy Mayor for  Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson . “The de Blasio  Administration is working hard to fight any attempts to undercount New Yorkers,  and I look forward to working with a leader with extraordinary managerial  experience and community savvy like Julie Menin to ensure that historically  disenfranchised and marginalized communities in our city won’t be scared into  silence.” “Because of Julie’s experience as a consumer advocate,  litigator, regulatory attorney and civic leader, she is uniquely qualified to  provide focused executive level oversight of the Law Department’s strategic  advocacy initiative and aggressively pursue opportunities to advance the City’s  policy objectives through litigation, legislation and rulemaking,” said Corporation  Counsel Zachary W. Carter . “I am thrilled to take on this new dual role as Census  Director and Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic Advocacy at  this critical juncture for our city when it has never been more important to  fight the threats to democracy and immigration that our city faces. We will  leave no stone unturned to ensure that every New Yorker is counted so our city  receives the billions in funding it deserves for public schools, health care,  child care, senior centers and infrastructure and that we will use every legal  avenue to protect our democratic ideals and make sure justice is served,” said Julie Menin, Director of the Census for New York City and Executive  Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic Advocacy . Many federal programs rely on the population figures  collected by the census to distribute federal funds among states and local  governments. A total of approximately $700 billion is distributed annually to  States across the country through approximately 300 different census-guided  federal grant and funding programs. These programs support essential services  including healthcare, public education, social services and infrastructure  development. Inaccurate population counts resulting from the Trump Administration’s  decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census could harm cities by  depriving them of their fair share of federal funding and removing crucial  resources for important government services. New York State alone also stands  to lose one congressional seat if the 2020 Census count is inaccurate. As a result, the de Blasio Administration joined the  Attorney General’s Office and other cities in a lawsuit to stop the Trump  administration from including the question in the Census. The de Blasio Administration  also allocated approximately $4.3 million dollars for its census efforts to  build out a citywide public awareness campaign for communities across New York  City. In September, the Department of City Planning submitted addresses for  more than 122,000 housing units that the Census Bureau did not have on its  address list for the 2020 Census. Approximately 300,000 additional New Yorkers  could now be counted as a result of this update. The Mayor also charged Deputy Mayor J. Phillip Thompson to  oversee and lead the Administration’s census efforts. Deputy Mayor Thompson  also appointed Nisha Agarwal as his Senior Advisor and Jorge Fanjul as his  Senior Advisor for DemocracyNYC and Deputy Director of Census Outreach and  Organizing. Julie Menin will bring her government and legal expertise and  community organizing skills to this team to further expand these outreach  efforts and will work closely with the Department of City Planning and the  Mayor’s Public Engagement Unit. The City will also work closely with the Census  Bureau’s Regional Office on preparations for the 2020 Census to ensure that the  special challenges in enumerating New York City’s population are addressed. About Julie Menin Julie Menin is an attorney and civic leader who has over two  decades of experience in the legal, regulatory and public sectors. Menin also  brings years of experience organizing, advocating and securing funding in the  non-profit, private and government sectors for a number of initiatives,  including her work as a leading force in the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan  in the wake of 9/11. In addition, Menin chaired Community Board 1 for seven  years in the aftermath of 9/11 and was a strong and vocal advocate for the  community. During her time as chair, she spearheaded the approval of the  Islamic Cultural Center and Mosque. Menin also served as Commissioner of the  Redistricting Commission in 2001 where she led a non-partisan effort to set new  City Council district lines. About Julie Menin Menin most recently served as the Commissioner of the Mayor's  Office of Media and Entertainment and launched dozens of new initiatives  that promote equality in the media and entertainment industry. Prior to  her time at MOME, Menin served as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer  Affairs, where she was instrumental in implementing many of the Mayor’s  signature projects, including the Paid Sick Leave Law, the Small Business  Relief Package to reduce fines on businesses, and the implementation of the  Living Wage Executive Order. In addition, she launched the City's first  expanded Earned Income Tax initiative, creating an outreach program that  resulted in an extraordinary 50 percent increase in New Yorkers using the  City's free tax centers and returning $260 million to low-income New Yorkers.  As Commissioner of DCA, Menin tackled bureaucratic barriers that stymied  economic growth and resulted in a one-third reduction in fines on small  businesses and 70 percent increase in consumer restitution. She also launched  investigations into not-for-profit colleges, fraudulent auto loans, debt  collectors, and other industries preying on New Yorkers. Menin also is an Adjunct Professor of Law and Public Policy  at Columbia University where she teaches When Cities Take the Lead ,  a class focused on how cities fill the void of state and federal inaction in  fields such as criminal justice, consumer protection, immigration and  environmental protection. She began her career as a regulatory attorney at  Wiley, Rein & Fielding in Washington D.C., where she specialized in  consumer protection issues and worked as Senior Regulatory Attorney at  Colgate-Palmolive in New York City handling regulatory matters for the agency  encompassing the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and consumer  litigation. Menin earned her B.A. Magna Cum Laude at Columbia University  and her J.D. at Northwestern University School of Law. “As the Department of City  Planning works to ensure that the U.S. Census Bureau has complete and accurate  data for the 2020 Census, I welcome the leadership and vision that Julie Menim  brings. Her know-how and long-standing record of fighting for New Yorkers will  help assure that there will be a fair count - which is essential for New York  City to receive the representation and resources that we deserve,” said Department  of City Planning Director Marisa Lago. “It is absolutely essential that every single New Yorker is  counted as part of the census,” said Congressman Jerrold Nadler .   “It is good news that Mayor de Blasio is appointing Julie Menin to lead New  York City’s effort on the census.  The census is not just a collection of  academic statistics.  It holds the key that unlocks political power for  New Yorkers, and that delivers much needed federal assistance to our City and  State.  I look forward to working with Julie as we make sure every New  Yorker is counted in the census.” Congresswoman Nydia M. Velázquez said, “The Census  serves as a fundamental bedrock of our democracy and, under this  Administration, we must be especially vigilant to ensure every New Yorker is  counted. With the White House pushing anti-immigrant policies, including  efforts to add a citizenship question to the Census, it’s more important than  ever that we have a strong voice at the city level working to ensure a fair,  accurate census count. Julie Menin is an outstanding choice for this role and I  applaud her appointment.” “The U.S. Census is a critical component in our efforts to  ensure a fair and fully representative government,” said Congressman Adriano  Espaillat . “I commend Mayor de Blasio on today’s announcement to appoint  Julie Menin as the new Census Director, who has a proven track record fighting  for New York City workers and will continue to stand up to ensure the voices of  millions of New Yorkers are counted and represented fairly in the next census.” "It is critical that every single New Yorker is  counted. As the current administration attempts to weaponize the census, New  York is at risk of losing critical resources and funding--as well as  Congressional representation--in the coming census. Every single New Yorker  must be counted, and I look forward to working with Ms. Menin, as well as  stakeholders at every level, to ensure that happens," said Bronx  Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. Assembly Member Marcos A. Crespo said, “This upcoming  Census will be one of the most challenging and important ever undertaken, which  is why strong leadership is required to further ensure we overcome federal  threats to a proper count. I commend Mayor de Blasio for understating that much  is at stake by appointing Julie Menin to oversee New York City Census efforts  as well as her role as Counsel For Strategic Advocacy. I look forward to  working closely with Julie to ensure we count every New Yorker and deliver the  resources and representation we need and deserve.” “Ensuring that our communities are counted and that  desperately needed resources reach the most vulnerable is the most important  priority for the upcoming census count. We know that there has been an effort  to disenfranchise some of the most marginalized members of our community from  participating in the 2020 Census,” said NYS Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa .  “I applaud Mayor De Blasio and his administration for investing into an  initiative that will ensure that all New Yorkers are counted. I congratulate  Julie Menin on her most recent  appointment to direct this important  initiative and know that because of her proven track record she will continue  to fight to bring fairness for all New Yorkers.” “The census is much more than a simple count of persons. It  determines the most fundamental elements of our democracy, from the number of  Representatives we get in Congress, to how much federal funding goes towards  our social welfare programs. As such, any attempt to lower participation - such  as Trump’s addition of a citizenship question - will dramatically undercount  how much New Yorkers - including our immigrant New Yorkers - deserve of both. I  applaud the appointment of Commissioner Menin as Director of the Census and  Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for Strategic Advocacy, and this  commitment on the part of the City to prioritize an aggressive outreach  campaign and legal strategy to counter the citizenship question's legality. I  offer my full support to ensure we can reach every New Yorker, including our  immigrant New Yorkers, who stand to benefit from a robust census," said Council  Member Carlos Menchaca, Chair of the Committee on Immigration . “Ensuring that every New Yorker is counted in the 2020  Census is critical for fair representation and the funding the City needs and  deserves,” said Council Member Fernando Cabrera, Chair of the Committee on  Governmental Operations. “Additionally, making sure that the City has a  strong voice in opposing federal efforts to marginalize immigrants and in  protecting public health and the environment is the right thing to do.  I  congratulate Commissioner Menin on this appointment.” “Julie Menin has always fought for ordinary New Yorkers. She  is the right person for this work, whether that means ensuring a fair census or  battling the worst that comes out of Washington DC,” said Michael Mulgrew,  president of the United Federation of Teachers. “As the nation’s largest property service workers’ union and  one of the largest representing immigrant workers, we are deeply concerned  about the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress immigrant response rates  to the 2020 Census,” said Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ SEIU. “That’s why we are so pleased that Julie Menin has been appointed Director for  Census in New York City and Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for  Strategic Advocacy. Given her strong track record, we are hopeful that she will  work closely with New York Counts 2020, the largest coalition of stakeholders  groups in New York State seeking a fair and accurate census, and that together  we will ensure that the 2020 Census counts everyone as our Constitution intends  and our democracy demands.” “This is a critical moment in history, and I commend Mayor  de Blasio for his selection of Julie Menin to lead the preparation for one of  the most challenging and important ground operations of his tenure, the 2020  Census,” said New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO President Vincent  Alvarez . “The New York City Labor Movement is committed to working with the  Census Bureau, the City of New York and all community partners to ensure that  every New Yorker is counted, that New York gets its fair share, and that we stand  together in solidarity to fight any attempts to undercount New York City.” “We are thrilled that Julie Menin will be leading the City's  Census efforts,” said Wayne Ho, President and CEO of the Chinese-American  Planning Council . “Asian American Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing  population in New York City and have historically been undercounted in the  Census. As a nonprofit organization with over 50 years of experience in this  diverse community, CPC looks forward to working with Julie to identify  resources to ensure that New Yorkers of all racial and immigrant backgrounds  are counted in the upcoming Census.” "The members at Make the Road New York are excited to  work with incoming New York City Census Director Julie Menin and the City of  New York so that the 2020 Census works for all New Yorkers," said Javier  H. Valdés, Co-Executive Director of Make the Road New York . "In order  to make sure that all New Yorkers get counted and the confidentiality of their  responses is protected, we need to forge a strong relationship between the City  and our communities and push back against the federal government. We look  forward to working in partnership to accomplish those goals." “The YMCA is here for all New Yorkers and as such, we want  to assure that all New Yorkers are counted,” said Sharon Greenberger,  President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater New York . “We thank the  administration for appointing Julie Menin today and are confident in her  leadership in spreading the urgent message that attaining an accurate and  complete count of our population is key to New York’s vitality into the next  century.” "A fair and accurate census is vital to New York City.  In Julie Menin, Mayor de Blasio has found the perfect leader to ensure that all  New Yorkers are counted. She's smart, effective, and committed to fighting for  all New Yorkers, and especially the most vulnerable among us,” said Bob Master,  Assistant to the Vice President of CWA District One .
