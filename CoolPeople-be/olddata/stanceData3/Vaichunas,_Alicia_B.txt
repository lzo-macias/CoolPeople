Fifty-nine of the races were in state house chambers, and five were in a state senate chamber. Click here to see a list of all the races. Of the 85 state legislative chambers that held elections in 2024, 21 (24.7%) had at least one race that was decided by fewer than 100 votes. The New Hampshire House of Representatives had 22 races decided by fewer than 100 votes—more than any other chamber. As of 2020 , there were, on average, 3,444 people in each New Hampshire House district, making them the smallest state legislative districts in the country. The Maine House of Representatives and Vermont House of Representatives each had nine races decided by fewer than 100 votes—the second-highest number after the New Hampshire House. The Maine House was also the only chamber where the number of races decided by fewer than 100 votes exceeded the total number of seats separating Democrats and Republicans following the election. In 2022 , there were two such chambers—the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Houses. In Maine, nine races were decided by fewer than 100 votes, and Democrats had a 76-73-2 majority after the election. This means that the Maine House was as close as 21 total votes away from a Republican majority. Had the two closest races won by Democrats— District 75 (decided by seven votes) and District 52 (decided by 14 votes)—been won by Republicans instead, the result would have been a 75-74-2 Republican majority. Across all 64 races, Democrats won 36 (56.3%), Republicans won 27 (42.2%), and one winner (1.6%) was unenrolled. In 2022, Democrats won 49 races by fewer than 100 votes (47.6%), Republicans won 52 (50.5%), Independents won one (1%), and one was tied. Most of the races took place in districts with small population sizes compared to the rest of the country. Forty-eight (75%) were in districts with a population of less than 25,000. Districts that size made up 26.3% of all state legislative districts as of 2020. In 2022 , there were 103 (1.64%) of the 6,278 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes. In 2020 , there were 30 (0.5%) of the 5,875 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes.

Click here for more details. As a result of the 2024 elections, there were 21 Republicans, 14 Democrats, and 5 independent members in the chamber. Elections for all 40 seats in the House took place on November 5, 2024. Ballotpedia identified elections in 15 districts as battleground elections . Members of the Alaska House formed multipartisan majority coalitions including both Democrats and Republicans after every election between 2016 and 2022. Although Republicans won a majority of seats in all four election years, the coalitions that formed after the 2016 , 2018 , and 2020 elections all included Democratic majorities, while the coalition that formed after the 2022 election included a Republican majority. The pre-election majority coalition included 20 Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent. All four majority coalitions included the members of the Bush Caucus, a group of Democratic and independent legislators representing four rural districts in Alaska's north (Districts 37 , 38 , 39 , and 40 ). Before the election, the Alaska Beacon wrote that the Bush Caucus had influenced Alaska politics for more than five decades because its members "have frequently put regional interests above those of party loyalty, and their willingness to cross the partisan aisle has frequently given them outsized power in the Capitol." [65] The minority coalition included the remaining Democrats and independents as well as Louise Stutes (R). David Eastman (R) did not caucus with either group. [66] The general election made use of ranked-choice voting , a system where voters rank the candidates on their ballot by preference order rather than being required to vote for a single candidate. Under ranked-choice voting, voters are permitted to vote for a single candidate or to rank fewer than four choices. The primaries used a top-four system where all candidates running for a given office appeared on the same ballot and the top four finishers advanced to the general election. Alaska voters approved both systems via a ballot measure in 2020. Another measure repealing the changes and returning to partisan primaries and single-vote general elections was on the 2024 ballot. Ballotpedia identified 15 of the 40 House districts as battlegrounds. Members of the Republican-led majority represented 10 battleground districts, while members of the Democratic-led minority represented the other five.

Before the election, local political observers said a multipartisan coalition including the Bush Caucus in the majority was a possible outcome. According to the Alaska Beacon , before the 2016 elections, "it was common for the Bush Caucus to join Republicans in the majority, the better to advocate for rural priorities." [67] According to the Beacon , "neither Republicans nor Democrats are in position to hold [23] seats, meaning that control of the House could come down to post-election negotiations.

Arizona State Senate elections See also: Arizona State Senate elections, 2024 All 30 seats in the state Senate were up for election. Following the election, Republicans maintained a 17-13 majority. Arizona also remained a divided government , with a Democrat holding the governorship and Republicans maintaining majorities in the state legislature.

At the time of the ruling, Arizona had two conflicting abortion laws—an 1864 territorial law banning abortion and a 2022 law with a 15-week ban. [70] The court ruled that the 1864 law took precedence. [70] Before the election, NPR' s Ryland Barton wrote, "Democrats are taking aim at GOP lawmakers who voted against repealing the ban.” [71] The Senate voted to repeal the law 16-14. [70] Before the election, NPR ’s Ben Giles wrote that Republicans “view immigration as a key issue here in Arizona, where voters do feel like there is a problem at the border with the number of border crossings that are happening day to day here in Arizona.” [72] NBC News ’ Adam Edelman wrote that the Republican State Leadership Committee released “ads on behalf of Republicans in three competitive districts that attacked Democrats on those issues.” [73] Ballotpedia identified seven battleground districts.

It was one of four states with a veto-proof majority of one party and a governor of another , along with Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont, with a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party . Democrats would have needed to gain three House seats or three Senate seats to block a Republican supermajority. To maintain their supermajority, Republicans needed to lose fewer than two House seats and fewer than three Senate seats. Kansas was one of 10 states that had a divided government. The outcome of the Senate elections alone could not have changed Kansas' trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the House. Before the elections, Kansas City News Service' s Zane Irwin said the partisan composition of the Legislature could have implications on the state's abortion policies. In 2022, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have prohibited the state from adding a Constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, the Legislature overrode Gov. Kelly's veto on HB2749 , which requires healthcare providers ask women questions about why they're getting an abortion. [79] Irwin also said, "[Democrats] are trying to block a flat tax. Republicans repeatedly have tried to pass a flat tax. Right now we have a multi-tiered tax system, and Republicans would like to bring it to where there's one rate that you pay in Kansas whether you are a low-income individual or are a millionaire.

[80] There were 11 open seats in the Senate, the most since Ballotpedia began tracking this data in 2012.  Of those open districts, Ballotpedia identified two as battlegrounds. Ballotpedia also identified six battleground districts in which incumbents sought re-election. Republicans represented five of the eight total battleground districts and Democrats represented three.

Before the election, Republicans held a 29-11 veto-proof majority in the chamber, and members were elected to four-year terms. Following the election, Republicans maintained a 31-9 veto-proof majority. With more than two-thirds control in each chamber, Republicans held a veto-proof majority, giving them the power to override Gov. Laura Kelly 's (D) veto. It was one of four states with a veto-proof majority of one party and a governor of another , along with Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont, with a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party . Democrats would have needed to gain three House seats or three Senate seats to block a Republican supermajority. To maintain their supermajority, Republicans needed to lose fewer than two House seats and fewer than three Senate seats. Kansas was one of 10 states that had a divided government. The outcome of the Senate elections alone could not have changed Kansas' trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the House. Before the elections, Kansas City News Service' s Zane Irwin said the partisan composition of the Legislature could have implications on the state's abortion policies. In 2022, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have prohibited the state from adding a Constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, the Legislature overrode Gov. Kelly's veto on HB2749 , which requires healthcare providers ask women questions about why they're getting an abortion. [79] Irwin also said, "[Democrats] are trying to block a flat tax.

Missouri State Senate elections See also: Missouri State Senate elections, 2024 (August 6 Republican primaries) There were nine contested Republican primaries for the Missouri Senate on August 6, 2024. An incumbent ran  in two of those primaries, and seven of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek  re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in Districts 3, 15, 21, 23, and 27 as battleground primaries, all but two of which were for open seats. The Missouri Senate had  the most turnover since the state implemented term-limits in 2002. Of the nine members leaving the chamber in 2024, six left  due to term limits. Three of those six senators—Sen. Bill Eigel (R), Sen. Denny Hoskins (R), and Sen. Andrew Koenig (R)—were members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus. [95] Of the two other members of the Senate who formally identified as Freedom Caucus members, Sen. Rick Brattin (R) advanced from the Republican primary in District 31 , and Sen. Nick Schroer's seat was not up for election. The 2024 primaries took place  in the context of a conflict among Senate Republicans over the future of the party. According to Jonathan Shorman and Kacen Bayless of The Kansas City Star, two groups of Republican senators "have grown more divided this session after senators announced the formation of the new Freedom Caucus with backing from the national States Freedom Caucus." [96] Several Senate Republicans who were not members of the Freedom Caucus criticized the group for their use of the filibuster after the Freedom Caucus filibustered approval of the chamber's journal, a committee referral increasing threshold requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, approval of a new congressional map, and the state's budget. [97] [98] [99] Following the Caucus' January filibuster of a bill that increased requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, President Pro Tempore Caleb Rowden (R) removed four Republican senators who identified with the Freedom Caucus from their committee chairmanships. [97] In explaining why he removed caucus members from their chairmanships, Rowden criticized the caucus' filibuster efforts and said they made it too hard for the Senate to pass legislation. Rowden said, "They [filibustered] repeatedly, day after day for two weeks, basically...It became necessary for us to do something that would indicate that we’re not going to let four guys run the place; it’s just not how this works." [100] Several members of the Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Bill Eigel (R), said Republicans outside of the Freedom Caucus, including Rowden, opposed  the caucus because he believed  they tried to preserve power. Eigel said, "It’s never been about policy for them. It’s been about individuals trying to preserve power at the expense of what we believe are the issues that Republicans sent us to Jefferson City for." [101] Missouri was, at the time of the election, one of 23 states with a Republican trifecta . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature. The Missouri State Senate was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There are 99 chambers throughout the country.

[101] Missouri was, at the time of the election, one of 23 states with a Republican trifecta . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature. The Missouri State Senate was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There are 99 chambers throughout the country.   Nevada State Senate elections See also: Nevada State Senate elections, 2024 Elections for 10 of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate took place on November 5, 2024 . The Nevada Senate was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There were 99 chambers throughout the country. Following the election, Democrats maintained a 13-8 majority. Nevada remained a divided government, with a Republican holding the governorship and Democrats maintaining majorities in the state legislature. Nevada Current's April Corbin Girnus wrote, "Democrats already have a supermajority in the Assembly. If Democrats can maintain that and flip a Senate seat, they will have enough votes to override any veto by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo." [102] Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) said  the prospect of a Democratic supermajority was "a huge concern and so much of a concern that I've been proactive in identifying candidates and supporting current candidates on the Republican side of the aisle." [103] Lombardo vetoed a state record of 75 bills during the 2023 legislative session. [104] Democrats campaigned against Lombardo's vetoes, and said he vetoed legislation that voters supported. [105] Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D) said the legislative elections offered a choice between Democrats who he said "are actually trying to solve problems and make life better for Nevadans, or Republicans, who offer nothing but complaints with no real solutions to any of the challenges facing Nevadans." [106] Assemblyman Gregory Hafen (R) was critical of the prospect of a super majority saying "It makes me very nervous to have one party control because the Nevada Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to implement any new tax. So not only is the Governor’s veto at stake here, but we’re talking about any tax that could be passed with just one party control." [107] At the time of the election, Nevada was one of 10 states that had a divided government . Republican Joe Lombardo (R) was governor while Democrats held majorities in both chambers of the Nevada Legislature . At the time of election, Democrats held 13 seats and Republicans held 7, with one vacancy in a seat previously held by a Republican. Ballotpedia identified 5 Senate battleground districts .

If Democrats can maintain that and flip a Senate seat, they will have enough votes to override any veto by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo." [102] Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) said  the prospect of a Democratic supermajority was "a huge concern and so much of a concern that I've been proactive in identifying candidates and supporting current candidates on the Republican side of the aisle." [103] Lombardo vetoed a state record of 75 bills during the 2023 legislative session. [104] Democrats campaigned against Lombardo's vetoes, and said he vetoed legislation that voters supported. [105] Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D) said the legislative elections offered a choice between Democrats who he said "are actually trying to solve problems and make life better for Nevadans, or Republicans, who offer nothing but complaints with no real solutions to any of the challenges facing Nevadans." [106] Assemblyman Gregory Hafen (R) was critical of the prospect of a super majority saying "It makes me very nervous to have one party control because the Nevada Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to implement any new tax. So not only is the Governor’s veto at stake here, but we’re talking about any tax that could be passed with just one party control."

Pennsylvania House of Representatives elections See also: Pennsylvania House of Representatives elections, 2024 Elections for all 203 seats in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives took place on November 5, 2024. Pennsylvania was one of 44 states that held legislative elections in 2024. Democrats maintained a 102-101 majority in the state House following the election. [127] The state also remained a divided government, with a Democrat controlling the governorship and Republicans and Democrats holding majorities in the Senate and House, respectively. Democrats had gained control of the state House in 2022 . [128] Republicans had controlled the chamber since 2011. Democrats needed to lose zero seats in 2024 to retain control of the chamber. Republicans needed to gain at least one seat to gain control of the chamber. Pennsylvania was one of 10 states with a divided government at the time of the 2024 elections and the only state where the two legislative chambers were controlled by different parties. [129] According to the National Conference of State Legislatures before the elections, "if a single chamber flips in Pennsylvania and all else holds equal, there would be no states with divided legislatures for the first time since at least 1900." [129] Democrats controlled the governorship and the state House, while Republicans controlled the state Senate. If Democrats had gained control of the state Senate and maintained control of the state House in 2024, Pennsylvania's government would have become a Democratic trifecta . If Republicans had maintained control of the state Senate or gained control of the state House, Pennsylvania's government would have remained divided. A pair of resignations on July 17, 2024, left Republicans with more seats than Democrats in the chamber. However, a rule adopted in July 2023 defined the majority party as “the political party that won the greater number of elections for the 203 seats in the House of Representatives in the general election preceding the term of service that began on the first day of December next after the general election.” Because of this rule, Democrats maintained their majority. [130] Two Democrats— Andre Carroll and Keith Harris —were elected unopposed in special elections to fill the vacancies. [131] The Associated Press' Mark Scolforo wrote, "Pennsylvania’s legislative Republicans would like to pass additional voter ID requirements, restrict abortion and make election changes to improve their odds of winning judicial races. Democrats want to bump up the state’s minimum wage and widen civil rights for LGBTQ people. In the closely divided General Assembly, those proposals have gone nowhere." [132] Both the Republican State Leadership Committee and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee said they would make Pennsylvania's state legislative elections a priority in 2024. [133] Ballotpedia identified 25 battleground districts. Democrats represented 12 of these battleground districts and Republicans represented 13. Incumbents ran in 20 of these races, while the other five were in open districts, meaning no incumbents ran. Click here to read more about the battleground elections.

[155] All 30 seats were up for election. Democrats held 21 seats, and Republicans held seven. Before the election, Vermont was one of 29 states where one party had a large enough majority in both legislative chambers to override gubernatorial vetoes without needing support from members of the other party. Democrats lost their veto-proof majority because they fell below the required 20 Senate seats. This election also determined Vermont's trifecta status . Before the election, Vermont was one of 10 states without a state government trifecta because the governor was a Republican and Democrats had majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. Because Republicans held the governorship and Democrats held their majorities in both legislative chambers, Vermont maintained its divided government.

An incumbent ran in 33 of those primaries, and nine of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in districts 7, 9, 24, 30, 43, 50, and 57 as battleground primaries. The primaries in districts 24 and 30 were for open seats, while incumbents faced primary challengers in districts 7, 9, 43, 50, and 57. The 2024 elections took place in the context of a conflict among House Republicans. While 57 of 62 House members were Republican, 26 voted with the Freedom Caucus, and 12 officially identified with the Freedom Caucus. [164] [165] This was a significant increase from 2017 when just five members identified with the Freedom Caucus. According to the Cowboy State Daily' s Leo Wolfson, "While Republicans have a supermajority in Wyoming, there’s a growing division between the Freedom Caucus and others in the party who say they’re too far right. Conversely, members of the Freedom Caucus have said these more centrist Republicans as being 'liberals' and couch them as adversaries who side with Democrats. There are 25-26 Republican members of the Wyoming House who are politically aligned with the Freedom Caucus. That leaves about 31 other Republicans and the five Democrats. Based on those numbers, the Freedom Caucus could gain as few as three seats to claim a majority of the Republican seats in the House. It would have to gain at least five or six seats to take a full majority." [166] According to WyoFile' s Maya Shimizu Harris, "In recent years, Republicans in Wyoming’s GOP-dominated Legislature have calcified into two distinct factions. That’s particularly the case in the House of Representatives where, last year, a group of lawmakers called the Wyoming Freedom Caucus staked their claim after partnering with a Washington, D.C.-based organization — the State Freedom Caucus Network — that aims to establish similar groups across the nation.... The partnership provides the group with a state director — Jessica Rubino, the spouse of Secretary of State Chief Policy Officer and Hageman nephew Joe Rubino — to research bills and provide vote recommendations." [164] Over the past two years, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has supported legislation to lower taxes, eliminate gun-free zones, ban abortions, ensure the state has closed primaries, and prohibit certain medical procedures for minors. [164] [167] [168] [169] [170] Because two-thirds of the chamber must approve measures for them to be included in the budget, the Freedom Caucus had sufficient numbers to block measures from being proposed in the budget. Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. John Bear (R) said the group "will not be deterred from exposing waste at all levels of government, nor the loss of our society’s moral compass by so many in the name of progress. It is what our voters sent us to Cheyenne to do." [171] [172] Freedom Caucus opponents formed a group called the Wyoming Caucus. State Rep. Clark Stith (R), a member of the Wyoming Caucus, said, "The most striking feature of the House Freedom Caucus this last session was they were voting in lockstep in accordance with text-message instructions that they would receive...The interesting effect of that is that it, to some extent, forced the remaining members of the House to become slightly more organized." Some Democratic representatives expressed alignment with the Wyoming Caucus during budget negotiations. Rep. Karlee Provenza (D) said, "Team Wyoming and the Democrats were voting on how to spend government money to benefit the people of Wyoming, knowing that some money has to be spent. The other side doesn’t think any money should be spent on anything and that churches and private organizations should save us."

[178] [179] Fifteen of those leaders (16.3%) faced contested primaries. [180] Of those, 11 were Republicans and four were Democrats. Three legislative leaders were defeated in their primaries, representing 20.0% of those who faced primaries and 3.3% of all legislative leaders seeking re-election. The 15 state legislators who faced primary challengers included three Idaho legislators as well as two each from Nevada and West Virginia. Click [show] on the table below for a table detailing the results of contested primaries involving state legislative leaders in 2024. Scott Saiki Hawaii House of Representatives Speaker d d 4.7% 254 Chuck Winder Idaho State Senate President pro tempore d d 4.6% 282 Mike Moyle Idaho House of Representatives Speaker  8.6% 799 Jason Monks Idaho House of Representatives Majority leader  34.2% 1,705 Rodric D.

One Republican served as president, one as president pro tempore , one as majority leader, and one Democrat served as speaker. Valerie Longhurst Valerie Longhurst First elected in 2003, Longhurst had served as Delaware's speaker of the House from 2023-2024. [183] Longhurst was previously the House Majority Whip from 2008-2012 and the House Majority Leader from 2012-2023. [183] Longhurst lost the Democratic primary to Kamela Smith (D) 53.3%-46.7%. During the primary, Longhurst's campaign website said, "Representative Valerie Longhurst has been diligently serving members of the 15th District since 2004 and has been instrumental in passing important, impactful legislation in various policy areas, including: mental and behavioral Health, quality public education, public safety and criminal justice reform, environment and energy, economic empowerment, health and quality of life, [and] women’s issues." [184] Delaware Online' s Shane Brennan said, "Voter turnout was consistently slow. Signs and workers representing state house representative candidates were not as common or visible as candidates for Wilmington, New Castle County and governor races." [185] [186] Smith was endorsed by the Working Families Party during the primary, and said, "Once I’m in Dover, I’ll be pushing for government transparency, better education, health care, and housing, and the investments in our people that they deserve." [187] [185] Scott Saiki Scott Saiki First elected in 1994, Saiki had served as Hawaii's speaker of the House since May 2017. Saiki was previously the House majority leader from 2013-2017. Saiki lost the Democratic primary to Kim Coco Iwamoto (D) 49.3%-44.6%. [188] During the campaign, Saiki's campaign website said, "When I think about the future for Hawaiʻi, I think about how we can create a more affordable Hawaiʻi. I believe that we need to address the root causes of why so many local families struggle: cost of living, housing that can be affordable for all, and public safety so that our ʻohana can thrive." [189] Spectrum News' Michael Tsai said local media expected a close race between Saiki and Iwamoto after the two candidates had competed against each other in the previous two election years. Tsai said, "Saiki had defeated Iwamoto by less than 200 votes in each of the last two elections...Iwamoto, an attorney and former state Board of Education member, previously fell short in races for state Senate District 13 and lieutenant governor in 2018. With her win on Saturday, she becomes the first transgender woman elected to the state Legislature." Chuck Winder Chuck Winder First elected in 2008, Winder had served as Idaho's senate president pro tempore since December 2020. [190] Winder lost the Republican primary to Josh Keyser (R) 52.3%–47.7%. Winder ran on his experience, with his campaign website quoting an editorial describing the incumbent as a "force of stability...a true conservative," saying Winder had "stepped up to oppose extremism while many others have remained silent." [191] Keyser ran as a political outsider, saying he would "offer a fresh perspective to help navigate the complex challenges we face in our beautiful state." [192] Idaho media identified Winder's opposition to the Idaho Freedom Caucus as an element in his defeat. Ahead of the 2024 legislative session, Winder removed two caucus members from committee leadership positions and disciplined a third, saying the members had posted content on social media that was defamatory to fellow legislative Republicans. Following the removal, the Republican Party of Ada County—Idaho's largest county—censured Winder. [193] In an interview with the Idaho Press , Winder said his opposition to the affiliated Idaho Freedom Foundation was a factor in his defeat. [194] Greg McCortney Greg McCortney First elected in 2016, McCortney had served as Oklahoma's senate majority leader since October 2021 and was selected earlier in 2024 to serve as president pro tempore after the 2024 elections. [195] [196] McCortney lost the Republican primary to Jonathan Wingard (R) 51.8%–48.2%. McCortney said he was running "to continue working for the things that make our area truly special things [ sic ] like our conservative values, strong schools, an improved economy, protecting our natural resources and promoting agriculture and energy." [197] Wingard ran on his military experience and values, saying he would "fight for you as a conservative, value-driven Oklahoman...It is my honor and privilege to ask you to join me as we fight the good fight of faith, freedom and rights." [198] KFOR political analyst Mike Turpen said the earlier timing of the 2024 legislative primaries as well as McCortney's business as a legislative leader were factors in the election because they left the incumbent with less time to campaign: "Everybody’s telling me this move, moving the election up a week… It cost him and others the ability to go campaign at home...And that was critical time lost on the campaign trail." [199] In an interview with KGOU , political science professor and district resident Christine Pappas said the results were a surprise: "It just kind of seemed like a regular old campaign where you expect the incumbent to win with 65%, 70% of the vote. And it was just quite shocking to see the outcome, which had Wingard narrowly beating McCortney. In fact, McCortney won no counties." [200] Craig Blair Craig Blair First elected in 2012, Blair had served as West Virginia's senate president since December 2020. [201] Blair lost the Republican primary to Tom Willis (R) 44.4%–32.2%. A third candidate, Michael Folk (R), received 23.4% of the vote. Blair ran on his experience in leadership, with his campaign website saying he "passed major reforms that led to more people working and being paid higher wages than ever before," "led the effort in the state legislature to pass the largest tax cut in history," and "passed the most pro-life legislation in state history which made abortion illegal in West Virginia." [202] Willis ran on his military experience and his involvement in the community, saying he was "the leader we need to build a better West Virginia." [203] Local media coverage discussed Blair's loss in the context of other incumbent defeats in the state senate. Blair was one of four state senators to lose a primary out of the 14 who filed for re-election in 2024. West Virginia MetroNews correspondent Brad McElhinny said Blair emphasized different policies than his two challengers: "Blair was conservative but emphasized his passion for economic development, for growth in West Virginia...The other two guys, Willis and (Mike) Folk, were much more animated by cultural issues." In an interview with MetroNews , consultant Greg Thomas said the district's demographics worked against Blair: "It’s the fastest growing part or [ sic ] the state and you have a lot of new voters which diminishes the power of the incumbency."

State legislative special elections State legislative special elections In 2024, 52 state legislative special elections were scheduled for 2024 in 22 states. Between 2011 and 2023, an average of 71 special elections took place each year. Impact of term limits Impact of term limits In 2024, 179 state legislators —77 state senators and 102 state representatives—were term-limited in 2024. This represented 3.1% of the 5,807 total seats up for election in November 2024. [205] There were fewer term-limited legislators in 2024 than in 2022 and 2020. In 2022 and 2020, there were 252 and 211 term-limited state legislators, respectively. Ballotpedia tracked the most term-limited legislators in 2010 when 375 legislators were termed out. 100 Republicans were term-limited, while 66 Democrats and 13 independents were term-limited. In even-numbered election years between 2010 and 2022, Democrats averaged about 99 term-limited legislators, while Republicans averaged 148 term-limited legislators. The Nebraska State Senate and Montana House of Representatives had the highest percentage of term-limited legislators in 2024. In the Nebraska Senate, 52% of the incumbents up for election were term-limited, while 17% of the Montana House were term-limited. Electoral competitiveness Electoral competitiveness Ballotpedia's 14th Annual State Legislative Competitiveness Report analyzed all 5,807 state legislative seats that were up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. State legislative competitiveness in 2024 was below average for even years from 2010 to 2024. In 2024, the nationwide State Legislative Competitiveness Index was 33.2 , down from the last three election cycles: 2022 (36.6), 2020 (33.4), and 2018 (36.1). State legislative competitiveness in 2024  (33.2) was below the 14-year competitiveness index average of 34.0. This average was for even-year elections only. Looking at averages across the last three even-year election cycles: 2024 had fewer open seats, incumbents in contested primaries, and seats with major competition. Key findings of this report include: 962 seats were open (16.6%) . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries (21.4%) . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 26.8% in 2022 but higher than the 20.1% in 2020. 3,583 seats were contested by both major parties (61.7%) , higher than in 2022 (59.2%) but lower than in 2018 (66.3%) and 2020 (65.2%).

Open seats Open seats There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, there were 962 open seats , guaranteeing at least 17% of all seats would be won by newcomers . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of open seats to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A greater number of open seats guarantees more newcomers entering legislatures and typically results in more candidates running for office. A smaller number of open seats guarantees fewer newcomers and typically results in fewer candidates running for office. In 2024 : There were 407 open Democratic seats , those most recently held by Democrats at the time of filing. There were 545 open Republican seats , those most recently held by Republicans at the time of filing. There were 10 other open seats . This includes those most recently held by minor party or independent officeholders at the time of filing. The total number of open seats—962—was higher than in 2020 (876), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 10% increase.

The "Other" value includes seats left open by minor party and independent officeholders.  Contested primaries Contested primaries There were 5,470 state legislative districts up for election nationwide, creating 10,642 possible primaries . Of that total, there were 1,731 contested primaries , meaning 16% of all primaries were contested . This percentage is tied with 2014 (16%) as the lowest percentage of contested primaries since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 5,470 state legislative districts 10,642 possible primaries In 2024 : There were 608 contested Democratic primaries , representing 12% of all possible Democratic primaries and a 27% decrease from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 1,005 contested Republican primaries , representing 19% of all possible Republican primaries and a 14% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 118 contested top-two/four primaries , representing 40% of all possible top-two/four primaries and an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. The total number of contested primaries—1,731—was down from 2020 (1,827), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 5% decrease.

Incumbents in contested primaries Incumbents in contested primaries There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Overall, 4,853 incumbents filed for re-election and were running at the time of their respective primaries. Of that total, 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries , representing 21% of all incumbents who filed for re-election . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 27% in 2022 but higher than the 20% in 2020. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of incumbents in contested primaries to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of contested primaries indicates more opportunities for voters to elect a non-incumbent to office. A smaller number indicates fewer of those opportunities. In 2024 : There were 365 Democratic incumbents in contested primaries , representing 17% of all Democratic incumbents who filed for re-election, a 26% decrease from 2020. There were 674 Republican incumbents in contested primaries , representing 26% of all Republican incumbents who filed for re-election, a 32% increase from 2020.

Major party competition Major party competition There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, 2,224 (38%) were uncontested and had no major party competition . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 41% in 2022 but higher than the 34% and 35% in 2018 and 2020, respectively. The remaining 3,583 (62%) seats were contested by both major parties. Ballotpedia uses the level of major party competition to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of seats without major party competition indicates fewer options on the ballot. A smaller number indicates more options. In 2024 : Democrats were guaranteed to win 1,111 seats (19%) that lacked Republican competition, an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Republicans were guaranteed to win 1,109 seats (19%) that lacked Democratic competition, a 10% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Overall, Democrats ran for 4,694 seats (81%) and Republicans ran for 4,692 (81%). There were four seats guaranteed to minor party or independent candidates because no major party candidates ran. The total number of seats without major party competition—2,224—was more than in 2020 (2,044), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 9% increase. One of the two major parties was guaranteed a simple majority in 19 chambers across 14 states due to the lack of major party competition.

Margin of victory Margin of victory Across all 5,807 seats up for election, the average margin of victory was 27.3% . An electoral margin of victory (MOV) is the difference between the share of votes cast for the winning candidate and the second-place candidate in an election. Only races with more than one candidate were included in this average. The chart below displays the breakdown of races by the winner's partisan affiliation and margin of victory for each state legislative chamber with single-member districts which held elections in 2024. A darker shade of red or blue indicates a larger margin for that party. The table below displays how many seats were up for election in each chamber and how many seats each party won. It also includes a breakdown of how many seats Democrats and Republicans won by 10% or less and without opposition in each chamber, as well as the average margin of victory for each party.

Additionally, in Alaska, a bipartisan governing coalition comprised of Democrats and Republicans won control of the Alaska Senate. Republicans previously controlled all five chambers. Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023 From 2010 to 2023, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 15 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and one—the New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2023 elections, Democrats controlled 41 chambers and Republicans controlled 56. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election. An example of this is the brief period of Democratic control in the Virginia State Senate in 2014.

From 2010 to 2018, the Republican Party increased its number of trifectas and the Democratic Party saw a decline in its trifectas. Democrats picked up six trifectas in the 2018 elections, and Republicans lost four trifectas. Following the 2021 elections, the Democratic trifecta in Virginia became a split government after Republicans gained control of the state House and governorship . After the 2023 elections, the divided government in Louisiana became a Republican trifecta when Jeff Landry (R) won election as governor. This chart shows the number of trifectas each party held heading into elections from 2010 to 2023, and the number of trifectas following the 2023 elections.

State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 2026 » « 2024 » «  2025 elections Choose a state below: New Jersey House Virginia House Submit Two of the country's 99 state legislative chambers are holding regularly-scheduled elections in 2025. Elections in those two chambers represent 180 of the country's 7,386 state legislative seats (2.4%). General elections in New Jersey and Virginia will take place on November 4, 2025 . Off-year elections in Virginia are often studied as a forecast of the broader political trends to expect from the following year's national elections. [1] The New York Times' Neil Vigdor wrote in December 2024, "In recent elections, Virginia has become a vessel for millions of dollars in spending by outside groups, and its open governor’s seat and divided legislature appears likely to continue that trend." [2] States are also holding special state legislative elections in 2025 to fill vacant seats. Click here for more .

Between 2011 and 2024, an average of 70 special elections took place each year. Targeted chambers Targeted chambers DLCC targets DLCC targets The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced they would target the Virginia House in the 2025 elections : [3] “ In 2023, the DLCC helped win full legislative control in Virginia by defending the Democratic majority in the state Senate and flipping the House of Delegates blue. This year, the stakes are high as we gear up for the first major electoral test of the Trump 2.0 era. Every seat in the state House is up for reelection and Virginia voters have an opportunity to elect a Democratic trifecta. [4] [5] ” RSLC targets RSLC targets As of April 2025, Ballotpedia did not identify any statements from RSLC about targeted chambers in 2025. To notify us of a resource to add, email us . Satellite spending Satellite spending Satellite spending describes political spending not controlled by candidates or their campaigns; that is, any political expenditures made by groups or individuals that are not directly affiliated with a candidate. This includes spending by political party committees, super PACs , trade associations, and 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups . [6] [7] [8] If available, this section includes links to online resources tracking satellite spending in this election. To notify us of a resource to add, email us . On Feb. 18, 2025, the Republican State Leadership Committee announced a six-figure Virginia ad campaign, stating: “ The RSLC PAC, in coordination with the Virginia House Republican Campaign Committee (HRCC), today launched a new digital ad exposing how Virginia House Democrats are breaking their promises to voters by pursuing an out-of-touch agenda in Richmond this legislative session. The ad will be backed by a six-figure buy on digital platforms throughout the state and highlights how Virginia House Democrats are blocking tax cuts and efforts to lower electric costs, as well as refusing to crack down on dangerous illegal immigrants. [9] [5] ” On April 7, 2025, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced a seven-figure Virginia ad campaign. DLCC Director Heather Williams said: “ Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025. [10] [5] ” Historical competitiveness data Historical competitiveness data Ballotpedia began examining the competitiveness of every state legislative race in the country in 2010. Three factors are used in this analysis: seats where the incumbent did not run for re-election, incumbents who ran in contested primaries, and seats contested by both major parties. The following table details competitiveness data collected from regularly scheduled state legislative elections between 2010 and 2023. Odd-year elections are shown grouped together first followed by even-year elections.

Election dates Election dates The following table details 2025 state legislative filing deadlines and primary dates in each state. The signature filing deadline was the date by which candidates had to file nominating signatures with election officials in order to have their names placed on the ballot. New Jersey March 24 June 10 Virginia April 3 June 17 Trifectas Trifectas State government trifecta is a term to describe single-party government, when one political party holds the governorship and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. As of April 25, 2025, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 15 Democratic trifectas,  and 12 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control. Political context Political context The 2025 cycle is the first election cycle after the 2024 presidential election . Both chambers in New Jersey and the Virginia House held elections in 2023 . Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024 From 2010 to 2024, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 14 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and two—the Minnesota House of Representatives and New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2024 elections, Democrats controlled 39 chambers and Republicans controlled 57. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House, and the Minnesota House was tied. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election.

Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 A state government trifecta occurs when one political party controls the primary levers of power in a state: the governor's office, the state Senate, and the state House. From 2010 to 2018, the Republican Party increased its number of trifectas and the Democratic Party saw a decline in its trifectas. Democrats picked up six trifectas in the 2018 elections, and Republicans lost four trifectas. Following the 2021 elections, the Democratic trifecta in Virginia became a split government after Republicans gained control of the state House and governorship . After the 2023 elections, the divided government in Louisiana became a Republican trifecta when Jeff Landry (R) won election as governor. After the 2024 elections, Republicans maintained their trifectas, and two Democratic trifectas became divided governments. This chart shows the number of trifectas each party held heading into elections from 2010 to 2024, and the number of trifectas following the 2024 elections.

Democrats lost supermajority status in New York and Vermont and gained it in Connecticut , while Republicans lost supermajority status in Montana and North Carolina and gained it in Iowa and South Carolina . Forty-four states held elections for at least one state legislative chamber. In total, there were veto-proof majorities in 29 state legislatures before the election—nine Democratic and 20 Republican. After the election, there were veto-proof majorities in 28 state legislatures —eight Democratic and 20 Republican. State governors may veto bills advanced by the state legislature. With sufficient support—between one-half and two-thirds of sitting legislators, depending on the state—state legislatures may overturn a gubernatorial veto. When one party controls enough seats to overturn a veto without any support from the other party, a legislature can be said to hold a veto-proof majority . These are most important when the governor belongs to the opposite party as the veto-proof legislature. Heading into the 2024 elections, four states had a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party: Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. After the elections, Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, North Carolina and Vermont lost that status, and no new state became a veto-proof legislature with an opposing party governor. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections, but neither state's legislative majority reached its supermajority threshold.

After the elections, seven had Democratic supermajorities, 18 had Republican supermajorities, and 19 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of those states before and after the elections.  Democratic 8 -1 7 Republican 18 0 18 No veto-proof majority 18 +1 19  Across all 50 state legislatures, there were nine Democratic supermajorities, 20 Republican supermajorities, and 21 states without a supermajority before the elections. After the elections, eight state legislatures had Democratic supermajorities, 20 had Republican supermajorities, and 22 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of all 50 states before and after the elections. Democratic 9 -1 8 Republican 20 0 20 No veto-proof majority 21 +1 22  The map below shows the veto-proof majority status across all 50 states after the 2024 elections.  Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities are most important when the other party controls the governorship. This creates more opportunities for legislatures to override gubernatorial vetoes. Heading into 2024, the 29 state legislatures where one party had a veto-proof majority in both chambers included four states where the governor was a member of a different political party than the veto-proof majority : Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, while North Carolina and Vermont lost it. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —had the potential to have veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Neither state acquired that status following the elections . The table below shows the status of the four states that had veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors and the two states that had the potential to acquire that status before and after the 2024 elections. Kansas Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes Kentucky Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes North Carolina Supermajority Democratic Yes No supermajority Democratic No Vermont Supermajority Republican Yes No supermajority Republican No Nevada No supermajority Republican No No supermajority Republican No Wisconsin No supermajority Democratic No No supermajority Democratic No States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Kansas and Kentucky both maintained their veto-proof status and remained Republican supermajorities with Democratic governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Vermont lost its veto-proof majority status. Before the election, Democrats in Vermont held one more than the 20 Senate seats required and seven more than the 100 House seats required for supermajority control. As of Nov. 18, Democrats won 16 Senate seats and 78 House seats, with five races uncalled. [1] North Carolina Republicans also lost their supermajority status following a key Democratic pickup in the House. [2] Republicans needed to maintain all 72 of their House seats to keep their veto-proof majority. The map below shows the states that have a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor after the 2024 elections.  States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors Ballotpedia identified two states with state legislative elections in 2024 that had the potential to gain a veto-proof majority of the party opposite the governor: Nevada and Wisconsin . Neither state became a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Nevada : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Nevada was Joe Lombardo (R). In Nevada, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Democratic Party held majorities in both chambers of the legislature that were below the threshold for a veto-proof majority. Democrats had 26-14 majority in the Nevada State Assembly (a two-thirds majority would require 28 seats) and a 13-7 majority in the Nevada State Senate (a two-thirds majority would require 14 seats). After the 2024 elections, Democrats had a 27-15 majority in the Assembly and a 13-8 majority in the Senate. Wisconsin : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Wisconsin was Tony Evers (D). In Wisconsin, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Republican Party reached the two-thirds threshold in the Wisconsin State Senate with its 22-10 majority but was short of this threshold in the Wisconsin State Assembly with its 64-35 majority. Republicans would need to control 66 Assembly seats to reach the two-thirds threshold. Republicans won 54 Assembly seats and 18 Senate seats. Accordingly, Wisconsin did not become a veto-proof supermajority with an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Summary of election outcomes Summary of election outcomes The following table includes state legislatures that gained , lost , or maintained veto-proof majority status in the 2024 elections.

There are three states — North Carolina , Vermont , and Wisconsin —that could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2022 elections. State legislatures with veto-proof majorities State legislatures with veto-proof majorities After the November 2022 elections, there were 27 state legislatures where one party held a veto-proof majority in both legislative chambers. [3] The number grew to 29 in 2023 due to legislators who switched parties . Republicans controlled twenty of the veto-proof legislatures, and Democrats controlled nine.  State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party Two of four states heading into the 2022 elections that had a veto-proof legislative majority and governor of the opposing party— Kentucky and Kansas —maintained that status after the elections. The other two states— Maryland and Massachusetts —no longer have that status since the party that held veto-proof legislative majorities also gained control of the governor's office in the 2022 elections. Vermont became a state with a veto-proof legislative majority and opposing-party governor as a result of the 2022 elections.

That is compared to a 0.4% shift following the 2022 elections. Democrats had a net loss of 54 seats , representing 0.7% of all state legislative seats. Republicans had a net gain of 55 seats , representing 0.7% of all state legislative seats. Independents and minor party officeholders had a net loss of one seat , representing 0.01% of all state legislative seats. In 2022, the partisan composition changed 0.4% toward Republicans, with Democrats losing four seats, Republicans gaining 27 seats, and Independents and minor party officeholders losing 20 seats. Both 2024 and 2022 produced a smaller shift than the 2020 elections, when Republicans gained 141 seats, Democrats lost 133, and Independents and minor party officeholders lost eight.

[2] The act would have introduced new regulation surrounding driftnet fishing, a method of fishing involving the use of a large net that drifts on ocean currents to catch fish. The act would have expanded an existing ban on gillnets longer than 2.5 kilometers to also prohibit the use of any nets with a mesh size exceeding 14 inches. It would also have required the U.S. Department of Commerce to carry out a program assisting in a transition away from driftnet fishing during the five years before it was set to take effect. [2] In his veto message , President Trump said that the bill would put fishermen out of business and was a solution to a problem that did not exist because existing fishing management programs worked to prevent overfishing without prohibiting the use of driftnets. President Trump added that the bill would increase demand for foreign seafood that is produced in countries with fewer regulations in place to prevent overfishing. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) introduced S.906 on March 27, 2019. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) signed on as cosponsors on June 18, 2019. It passed the Senate by voice vote on July 22, 2020, and passed the House 283-105 on Dec. 10, 2020. The 283 yeas included 226 Democrats, 56 Republicans, and one independent. All 105 nay votes were Republicans. Thirty-five Republicans and six Democrats did not vote. H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 On Dec. 23, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 . [3] On December 29, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 322-87 to override Trump's veto. [12] The National Defense Authorization Act (N.D.A.A.) authorizes appropriations and sets policies for the Department of Defense on an annual basis. H.R.6395 applied to FY2021 which began on Oct. 1, 2020, and ended on Sept. 30, 2021. The N.D.A.A. does not set overall spending levels, but rather authorizes appropriations established in separate pieces of legislation. [3] In his veto message, Trump identified four provisions included in H.R.6395, with which he disagreed: [13] Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act : the Communications Decency Act was passed in 1996. Section 230 of that law guarantees websites and Internet providers protection from lawsuits over content posted or shared on those platforms by users. Trump supported the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which H.R.6395 did not contain. Trump wrote, "Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity." [13] Renamining certain military installations : H.R.6395 included a process to rename military installations named after Confederate soldiers through a National Commission on Modernizing Military Installation Designations staffed by members of Congress and military service secretaries. [3] Trump wrote, "I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles." [13] Limits on emergency military construction fund usage : H.R.6395 set a limit on how much the Defense Department could re-allocate within its budget for emergency military construction directed by the president.  In his veto message, Trump wrote, "In a time when adversaries have the means to directly attack the homeland, the President must be able to safeguard the American people without having to wait for congressional authorization." [13] Limits on troop withdrawals : H.R.6395 set limits on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea. In Afghanistan and Germany, the resolution dictated that the planned withdrawals of 2,000 and 12,000 troops from each country, respectively, be halted pending review from the Defense and State Departments. [14] In South Korea, the resolution prohibited the usage of funds to decrease troop levels in the country below 28,500. [15] Trump wrote, "Article II of the Constitution makes the President the Commander in Chief ... [T]he decision regarding how many troops to deploy and where, including in Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea, rests with him. The Congress may not arrogate this authority to itself or indirectly as purported spending restrictions." [13] Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) introduced H.R.6395 introduced the resolution on March 26, 2020. On Dec. 8, the House voted 335-78 to pass the resolution with 195 Democrats and 140 Republicans voting yea and 37 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and one Libertarian voting nay. The Senate voted 84-13 to pass the resolution on Dec. 11 with 41 Democrats, 42 Republicans, and one Independent voting yea and five Democrats, seven Republicans, and one Independent voting nay. [3] Both chambers passed H.R.6395 with more than the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability".  H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". On May 29, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". [4] The resolution was introduced to block a 2019 U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) rule related to government forgiveness of certain student loan debt. The rule changed the process students must follow to discharge their loans and empowered the D.O.E. to collect money from schools to cover financial losses following successful student challenges. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos argued in a December 2019 press release that the new rule “ensures that taxpayers who did not go to college or who faithfully paid off their student loans do not shoulder student loan costs for those who didn’t suffer harm.” [16] Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nevada) introduced the resolution on September 26, 2019. On January 16, 2020, 225 Democrats and six Republicans voted to pass the resolution in the U.S. House while 179 Republicans and Justin Amash (L-Mich.) voted nay. A version of the resolution passed the U.S. Senate on March 11 with 42 Democrats, 10 Republicans, and Angus King (I-Maine) voting to pass the resolution while 42 Republicans voted nay. In his veto message, Trump said, “Whereas the last administration promoted a regulatory environment that produced precipitous school closures and stranded students, this new rule puts the needs of students first, extends the window during which they can qualify for loan discharge, and encourages schools to provide students with opportunities to complete their educations and continue their pursuit of economic success.” [17] S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. On May 6, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. [5] The resolution was introduced in response to a January 3 airstrike ordered by the president that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Qods Force, a unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [18] [19] The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on January 9, 2020. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 55-45 vote on February 13, 2020, and the U.S. House by a 227-186 vote on March 11, 2020. The resolution prohibited the president from engaging in the use of force against Iran without prior congressional approval either in the form of a declaration of war or a specific authorization. [5] The resolution allowed the president to use military force against Iran without congressional approval only if it was in order to defend the U.S. against an imminent attack. [5] In his veto message, President Trump argued that the resolution "incorrectly implies that the military airstrike against Qassem Soleimani in Iraq was conducted without statutory authority," saying it was authorized under the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. [18] The President also said the resolution threatened to hinder the ability of the U.S. to defend itself and its allies against hostilities from Iran or other forces backed by the country. [18] S.J.Res.38 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution was introduced by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) on June 5, 2019. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 53-45 vote on June 20, 2019, and the U.S. House by a 237-190 vote on July 17, 2019. The resolution prohibited an export license providing technical data allowing for the manufacture of the Aurora fuzing system used in the Paveway IV laser-guided bomb to Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [7] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution could "produce unintended consequences for defense procurement and interoperability with and between our partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen and endanger the lives of U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia. [20] S.J.Res.37 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of France of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution prohibited an export license related to the Paveway II laser-guided bomb to France, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [8] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened "weaken America’s global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen by weakening the capabilities of the United Arab Emirates, placing U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia at risk. [21] S.J.Res.54 - A joint resolution relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019.  S.J.Res.54 - A joint resolution relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019.

The resolution was similar to H.J.Res.46 , which Trump vetoed on March 15, 2019. The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on September 10, 2019. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 54-41 vote on September 25, 2019, and the U.S. House by a 236-174 on September 27, 2019. The resolution terminated the national emergency declaration made by Trump on February 15, 2019, which directed $8.1 billion towards building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In his veto message, Trump said that the emergency declaration, "empowered my Administration’s Government-wide strategy to counter large-scale unlawful migration and to respond to corresponding humanitarian challenges ... [and] facilitated the military’s ongoing construction of virtually insurmountable physical barriers along hundreds of miles of our southern border." [22] He said, "The southern border ... continues to be a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics to come into our country," adding, "S.J. Res. 54 would undermine the Government’s ability to address this continuing national emergency." [22] S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services.  S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services. On July 24, 2019, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution prohibited export and manufacturing licenses related to the Paveway II and Paveway IV laser-guided bombs to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. In particular, the resolution identified a manufacturing agreement under which Paveway components would be produced in Saudi Arabia. [9] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened to limit U.S. security capabilities, endanger U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia, prolong the war in Yemen, and "damage the credibility of the United States as a reliable partner by signaling that we are willing to abandon our partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing."

What is a presidential veto? Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States gives the president of the United States the ability to veto a bill passed by Congress. The president can issue a regular veto or a pocket veto. Regular veto : "The regular veto is a qualified negative veto. The President returns the unsigned legislation to the originating house of Congress within a 10 day period usually with a memorandum of disapproval or a 'veto message.' Congress can override the President’s decision if it musters the necessary two–thirds vote of each house." [28] Pocket veto : "The pocket veto is an absolute veto that cannot be overridden. The veto becomes effective when the President fails to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned and is unable to override the veto. The authority of the pocket veto is derived from the Constitution’s Article I, section 7, 'the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case, it shall not be law.'" [28] Article I, Section 7  Article I, Section 7 According to Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States, “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.

Article III does not limit when the Legislature can convene in regular session.  However, Section 18 of Article III does contain provisions related to special sessions of the Legislature.  Section 18 states that a special session can be called by a petition of request from two-thirds of both legislative houses. Since the Legislature is in session all year, a member must gavel in a session every three days. If a member does not gavel in a session, then only the governor can call the Legislature back into session.

[14] Role in state budget Role in state budget New York on New York on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions New York operates on an annual budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [15] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies between August and September . State agencies submit budget requests in October and November . Agency hearings are held between October and November . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the New York State Legislature in mid-January . The deadline is February 1 in years following a gubernatorial election. The legislature adopts a budget in March . A simple majority is needed to pass a budget. The fiscal year begins in April . New York is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [15] [16] The governor is constitutionally required to submit a balanced budget. In turn, the legislature is required by statute to pass a balanced budget. [15] District maps District maps State Senate State Senate  State Assembly State Assembly  Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in New York are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members in both chambers. Two-thirds of members in both chambers must vote to override a veto, which is 100 of the 150 members in the New York State Assembly and 42 of the 63 members in the New York State Senate . New York is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Authority: Article IV, Section 7 of the New York Constitution . "Every bill which shall have passed the senate and assembly shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the governor; if the governor approve, he or she shall sign it; but if not, he or she shall return it with his or her objections to the house in which it shall have originated, which shall enter the objections at large on the journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of the members elected to that house, it shall become a law notwithstanding the objections of the governor." Redistricting Redistricting On March 14, 2012, the state legislature approved a constitutional amendment to establish new redistricting procedures beginning in 2020. The New York Constitution requires that two successive legislatures approve an amendment in order to qualify it for final approval by popular vote. The legislature approved the amendment a second time in 2013. On November 4, 2014, voters approved the amendment, the provisions of which were set to take effect during the 2020 redistricting cycle. [17] The 10-member commission comprises the following members: [17] Two members must be appointed by the temporary president of the New York State Senate . Two members must be appointed by the speaker of the New York State Assembly . Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Senate . Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Assembly . Two members must appointed by the aforementioned eight commissioners. These two appointees cannot have been enrolled in the top two major political parties in the state. The legislature must approve the commission's plans by a simple up/down vote. The legislature must reject two separate sets of redistricting plans before it will be able to amend the commission's proposals. All districts will be required "to preserve minority rights, be equally populated, and consist of compact and contiguous territory." Further, state law will require that districts "not be drawn to discourage competition or to favor/disfavor candidates or parties." In prior redistricting cycles, authority for both congressional and state legislative redistricting was vested with the state legislature. An advisory commission participated in the process. [17] State law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and compact. State legislative districts must also take into account the "historic and traditional significance of counties." [17] 2020 2020 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State Assembly districts New York enacted new state Assembly district boundaries on April 24, 2023, when Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed legislation establishing them for use starting with the 2024 elections. [18] The bill adopting the districts passed earlier that day in the state Assembly by a vote of 132-13, and it passed the state Senate by a vote of 59-1. [19] [20] The legislation stated, "Vacancies in the Assembly will be filled using existing boundaries until January 1, 2025, at which time vacancies will be filled using the new boundaries." [21] The state redrew its Assembly district boundaries in response to a June 10, 2022, decision by the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court in Nichols v. Hochul . [22] That court upheld a lower court ruling that declared the state's Assembly district boundaries invalid but determined that they should still be used for the 2022 legislative elections since the lawsuit challenging them was filed too close to those elections for the courts to intervene. [23] The appellate division ruling determined that the Assembly district map was enacted in violation of the state's constitutional redistricting process and ordered a New York City-based state trial court to oversee the redrawing of boundaries for the 2024 elections. [23] On September 29, 2022, that trial court directed the IRC to "initiate the constitutional process for amending the assembly district map based on the 2020 census data by formulating a proposed assembly map" and submit such a plan to the legislature by April 28, 2023. [24] The New York State Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) had voted 9-1 on April 20, 2023, to advance this plan and submit it to the legislature with the Commission stating in its cover letter that the plan "garnered the highest number of votes in support" at its meeting on that date. [25] [26] According to Giulia Heyward and Jon Campbell at Gothamist , the new districts replaced "a nearly identical set of districts that were just put into place for last year’s races before a court threw them out." [27] Heyward and Campbell also wrote that "The commission had originally put forward a draft that would have made considerable changes before settling on a revised proposal last week mirroring the lines already in place." [27] Click here to view more information about Assembly districts enacted in 2023, including zoomable maps and links to detailed demographic statistics for each district.' State Senate districts On May 20, 2022, Justice Patrick McAllister ordered the adoption of a new state senate map drawn by redistricting special master Jonathan Cervas which took effect for New York's 2022 legislative elections. [28] On April 27, the New York Court of Appeals , the state's highest court, overturned a decision by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court which overturned a lower court's ruling invalidating the legislature's state Senate boundaries. [29] [30] [31] [22] Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) had signed new state legislative district boundaries into law on February 3, 2022. The New York State Senate voted 43-20 to approve them, and the New York State Assembly approved them 120-27 on the same day. [32] [33] Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie supported the new districts, saying, "I think the [commission] listened to the testimony that was given to them throughout all of the hearings across the state, and I think they came back with a fair map." [34] Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of Citizens Union, criticized the new boundaries as too similar to the ones already in place: "The new Assembly districts approved by the Independent Redistricting Commission are strikingly similar to the districts drawn by the legislature last year...This similarity suggests that the Commission drew the Assembly maps to please lawmakers." [35] Citizens Union describes itself on its website as a group "committed to reforming New York City and State government by fostering transparency, accountability, accessibility, honesty and the highest ethical standards." [36] Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Following the passage of the map, Hochul said: "These bills are necessary to reapportion districts and to provide certainty and clarity regarding such districts in a timely manner, allowing for efficient administration of the electoral process." State Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy said: "There is a wild, partisan gerrymandering that took place here. It violates the state Constitution, and we’re going to try to get justice."

The state's growth rate was at 2.19%, which was below the national rate of 9.7%. [38] Redistricting became an issue in the state prior to the November 2010 elections. Going into the elections, the organization NY Uprising asked all candidates to sign a pledge to support nonpartisan redistricting during the following legislative session. A majority of those who won in both chambers signed the pledge. [39] Additionally, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) stated his pledge to veto any new maps that were not drawn through a nonpartisan process. [40] Following a number of delays, the Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment (LATFOR) released proposed Senate and Assembly maps on January 26, 2012. The Senate plan included an additional 63rd seat. Gov. Cuomo threatened to veto the maps. [41] On March 11, LATFOR filed a bill of their final plans, which closely resembled the maps they released two months earlier. Along with this, leaders offered a constitutional amendment that would set up a new bipartisan commission on redistricting following the next census in 2020. [42] Following a walkout of Senate Democrats, the bill passed. Later that week the constitutional amendment passed. [43] With that approved, Cuomo said, "It’s over once and for all" [44] and signed the maps into law.

The New York State Senate is one of 13 state senates that was Republican for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. Across the country, there were 541 Democratic and 517 Republican state senates from 1992 to 2013. New York State House of Representatives: During every year from 1992-2013, the Democratic Party was the majority in the New York State House of Representatives. The New York State House of Representatives is one of 18 state Houses that was Democratic for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. Across the country, there were 577 Democratic and 483 Republican State Houses of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. Over the course of the 22-year study, state governments became increasingly more partisan. At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states, the most in the 22 years studied. The chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of New York , the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly from 1992 to 2013. SQLI and partisanship SQLI and partisanship The chart below depicts the partisanship of the New York state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. New York experienced a Democratic trifecta from 2009-2010. During half the years of the study, New York was ranked in the bottom-10. Its lowest ranking, finishing 43rd, occurred from 2005-2006, during a divided government. Its best ranking also occurred during a divided government, finishing 32nd in 2011.  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the New York Constitution can be amended:  I • II • III • IV • V • VI • VII • VIII • IX • X • XI • XII • XIII • XIV • XV • XVI • XVII • XVIII • XIX • XX The New York Constitution can be amended through legislatively referred constitutional amendments or through constitutional conventions . Legislature Legislature A simple majority vote is required during two successive legislative sessions for the New York State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 126 votes in the New York State Assembly and 32 votes in the New York State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention According to Section 2 of Article XIX of the New York Constitution , a question about whether to hold a state constitutional convention is to automatically appear on the state's ballot every 20 years starting in 1957. New York is one of 14 states that provides for an automatic constitutional convention question.

Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House members are included in each state's congressional delegation. In addition to incumbents defeated in elections, appointments to state and executive offices, resignations, and retirements also changed the composition of congressional delegations. Delaware sent the greatest percentage of new members to the 119th Congress. Two of the three (66.7%) members of New Mexico's delegation were new members. Thirty-three states sent the same members of Congress that represented them at the end of the 118th Congress. The congressional delegations of four states became more Democratic. The party gained one member each in Alabama, Louisiana, and Oregon. The party also gained three members each in California and New York. The congressional delegations of eight states became more Republican. The party gained one member in Alaska, Colorado, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. The party also gained three members each in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

This tradition is rooted in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution, which states that the president "may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices." [1] The vice president and several other administrators, directors, and representatives are also part of the Cabinet. Click here for an overview of Trump's Cabinet members. The following individuals are members of Trump's Cabinet. They have either been confirmed by the U.S. Senate or hold a position that does not require Senate confirmation.   Nominees awaiting confirmation Nominees awaiting confirmation TBD , Ambassador to the United Nations  Key legislation Key legislation This section provides overviews of key federal legislation considered during the second Trump administration . To be included, the bill must have met several of the following qualifying factors: Collaboration between the president and congressional leadership on the bill Use of the reconciliation process to pass the bill Changes to the congressional procedure to pass the bill Estimated cost of the bill as evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office Extent of public relations campaign to promote the bill Domestic and international policy ramifications Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process This page provides information about budget resolutions proposed and adopted during the 119th Congress . Budget resolutions are resolutions that broadly outline spending priorities for a reconciliation bill . The Senate and the House adopting identical budget resolutions is the first step in the reconciliation process. [2] Budget reconciliation is a legislative process that can be used to override the filibuster and expedite the approval of a package of legislation in Congress that changes spending, revenues, or the debt limit. The House voted 217-215 on February 25, 2025, to adopt the initial version of the budget resolution (H.Con.Res.14) that included border, defense, and energy spending, along with tax reductions to replace the expiring tax policy from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018 . [3] There were 217 Republicans who voted in favor of the resolution, while Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and 214 Democrats voted against the resolution. [4] The Senate voted 51-48 to adopt an amended version of H.Con.Res.14 on April 5, 2025. The amended version also included a debt ceiling increase. [5] On April 10, the House voted to adopt the Senate-amended version of HCon.Res.14, completing the budget resolution process. The House voted 216-214 in favor of the resolution, with Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joining 212 Democrats in voting against the resolution. The Senate had previously voted 52-48 to approve a version of the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution (S.Con.Res.7) focused primarily on border, defense, and energy spending in February. [6] Trump's executive orders and actions  Trump's executive orders and actions As of April 24, 2025, President Donald Trump (R) had signed 139 executive orders , 37 memoranda , and 39 proclamations in his second presidential term , which began on January 20, 2025. Each type of presidential document is different in authority and implementation. Executive orders are directives the president writes to officials within the executive branch requiring them to take or stop some action related to policy or management. They are numbered, published in the Federal Register , cite the authority by which the president is making the order, and the Office of Management and Budget issues budgetary impact analyses for each order. [7] [8] Presidential memoranda and notices also include instructions directed at executive officials, but they are neither numbered nor have the same publication requirements. The Office of Management and Budget is also not required to issue a budgetary impact statement on the subject of the memoranda or notices. [9] [10] In his 2014 book, By Order of the President: The Use and Abuse of Executive Direct Action , Phillip J. Cooper, a professor of public administration at Portland State University, wrote, "As a practical matter, the memorandum is now being used as the equivalent of an executive order, but without meeting the legal requirements for an executive order." [11] Proclamations are a third type of executive directive that typically relate to private individuals or ceremonial events, such as holidays and commemorations. [9] [12] Trump has issued 139 executive orders so far during his year in office, which is the highest first-year executive order total since Harry Truman (D), who also issued 139 executive orders in 1945. Looking at his second term executive orders by topic , Trump has issued the most executive orders on foreign policy (35). Across his first and second terms, Trump has issued a total of 359 executive orders. This is the 12th-most executive orders issued by any president in U.S. history.  Click here for a complete list of Trump's executive actions. Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump (R) has not nominated any individuals to federal judgeships on Article III courts. During his first term in office, President Donald Trump (R) nominated 274 individuals to federal judgeships. Trump made 245 judicial appointments.
