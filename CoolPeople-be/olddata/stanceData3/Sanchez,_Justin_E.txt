Why We Run: Justin Sanchez Run for Something Follow 8 min read · Jun 1, 2017 -- Listen Share Justin Sanchez is a Bronx native running to represent District 14 on the New York City Council. What sparked you to decide to run this year? I was born, raised and educated here in the Bronx and for the past 20 years our community has had a complete lack of leadership. There’s a complete lack of community engagement from our current City Council member and we can see that from the state of our community boards. In the last month and a half, we’ve had over 15 members drop out of our community board and our community is about to go through a massive rezoning and that means developers are going to come in and reshape the entire landscape of what our community looks like. Right now, an average family of four here in the Bronx makes $34,000 a year in my neighborhood. Our number one problem is our rent burden. Over 60% of residents here pay more than a third of their annual salary to rent. That’s why I’m running: Because we need the leadership to remember that a public servant is someone that actually is beholden solely to their residents, solely to their community, and I will fight everyday to make sure that the community is put first — not the developers and the real estate company and everyone else that wants to come in for a piece of the pie, but the people that are worried where their next paycheck is going to come from. I’m running to make sure that we’re bringing in local jobs with this rezoning that’s about to happen in the community. [I’m running to] make sure that when they bring in these developers, all these new construction jobs are union jobs that are going to local workers first. Further than that, I want to make sure that we’re bringing in great worker cooperatives which allows people to not only get a paycheck but to start accumulating wealth. You can’t really accumulate wealth if you’re living paycheck-to-paycheck, and if you bring in these worker cooperatives, it leads to the path of having a piece of the pie, a part of that business. Moving beyond that, we’re facing massive federal budget cuts to our public housing, so we need to be preserving our public housing. We need to fight homelessness. Right now in the state of New York, we have the highest rate of homelessness ever in our history, and we have the highest rate of homelessness in the city in our history. We need to implement a pipeline from shelters to permanent housing and that involves instituting supportive housing, making sure that individuals with mental health problems and families out on their luck are getting the support they need to move their families into permanent housing so that they can achieve their American dream. And finally none of this will get done without organizing our community. I’m sick and tired of having our politicians come around here only when there’s a vote. The fun fact is that my apartment building where I’m running my office is on the same block as my City Councilman’s district office, yet no one on our block, or on the surrounding blocks, knows who he is or what he does. I want to be the person that implements a community task force that will ensure that our residents are getting the most up-to-date information on what’s happening in the community, not only when we need votes but all year round. How do you think your campaign is going? I feel like my campaign is going absolutely amazing. Two weeks before I started my campaign I was a server at a restaurant. I those two weeks, we raised over $17,000. Wow. I’m a publicly funded candidate. I don’t take money from any corporations. I get all of my funds from real people and because I do that the city will then match all of my New York City contributions up to $175. When you factor that in, my campaign is sitting well over $70,000, once we finish ticking off those final little check marks that we need to confirm our matching funds. So for a little server in New York City, we’re doing pretty well. What are you enjoying most about campaigning? What have you learned or what has surprised you about your community? I guess it’s not surprising, but it’s how disengaged many of the community members are. As I said before, I’m on the same block as the district office for the City Council member and my local community board meets only three blocks away. I come from a field background. I’ve been working on a campaigns since I was 15 years old, knocking on doors for Democrats and now when I’ve been knocking on doors in my neighborhood specifically it’s just shocking to see so many people have no idea what’s happening blocks away from their house. It’s not because they don’t want to know but it’s because you know no one has tried to engage them. That’s what’s been the most surprising. I’m able to engage people that have never had someone knock on their door. And when they do invite you into their homes, are you discovering even more support for the issues you intend to advocate for? Or, do they bring up issues that weren’t on your personal radar? There is something that has surprised me. Even though we’re all Democrats, called the Bible Belt of the Bronx. I’m Hispanic and a lot of Hispanics are really devout Catholics and they pay very close attention to the Bible. My current City Council member is a pastor and during his last election, he posted a video of himself praising the anti-LGBT laws passed in Uganda. Laws that call for people like me to be executed just for the idea that they might be gay. My City Council member put up a video supporting this law, and that’s really reflective of the sentiment, or so I thought, of how people viewed gay people in the neighborhood. Because I grew up with those same kind of feelings from the older Hispanic generation. The lack of acceptance. That’s why I didn’t come out of the closet until three years ago, and now I’m an openly LGBT man running against a very openly anti-LGBT incumbent. And the thing that I found most surprising about this is that a lot of the neighborhood hasn’t heard the rhetoric that he is uses against the LGBT community, and in a community that’s called the Bible Belt of the Bronx, to have people get engaged and feel something when you talk about his anti-LGBT rhetoric, about how bad that is, to hear those words coming out of residents who are extremely devout Catholics, the older generation that has never been that accepting before… that is something that has blown me away and really has added more fuel the fire. Things like this are accepted here in New York City, and it’s wonderful that you can now see the progression from my grandparents back in the day to now. Have you run into any pushback being a young person running for office? Actually that’s been one of the most surprising things. A lot of people bring up the fact that I am young and instead of it being a downside it’s a plus. The thing that I hear most often is, “We’re so excited for a fresh face.” When I’m talking to seniors at senior centers, they are overwhelmed to see someone young running for office and they’re excited and they are happy to see some fresh blood, some fresh faces out there with the new ideas and they’re not radical ideas they’re just common sense solutions to 21st century problems. As you’re looking ahead, is there any obstacle you see? What do you want to do better at or more of? I want to continue engaging with this community. One of the biggest statistics to me that really blows my mind, and I try to tell everyone I speak to about it, is that my neighborhood has 166,000 people in it. Out of those 166,000 thousand people, we have over 100,000 registered voters. Yet when an election year comes around, even this [past] year, only roughly 9,000 of those people go out to vote. In New York, we don’t have automatic voter registration. People have to sign up to vote and over 100,000 of our residents signed up to vote. But you can’t tell me that 90,000 people don’t care or give a damn about their neighborhood. That’s just not true. What that says is that there’s a complete disconnect between the community leadership and the community residents and if I can do anything for this community — win or lose — if I can bring out even 20,000 people to vote, rather than that 9,000 that came out last time, I think that would be a victory for the community and for the campaign. What resource or piece of advice you’ve found through Run for Something has helped you most? The Slack community has been awesome because you can feel out different ideas and people always come back to you with new ideas. It’s also a great way, as a candidate myself, to see what other candidates are going through. I love when people ask policy questions, or how different fundraising things are going, and I love being able to share any knowledge that I have so that I can learn from everyone else. As a candidate, you always have to be learning and being able to bring that knowledge to my team, it just opens the whole game. If people want to volunteer or contribute to your campaign, what’s the best way to do that? Donations. Donations. Donations. We have a huge race on our hands and we’re trying to take out an incumbent. It’s not easy for anyone, but the best way to really help out with the campaign is to donate on our website: www.electsanchez.com. New York City donors are our number one resource. Anyone from all over the world can donate, but New York City donations mean so much more because as a publicly funded candidate, any New York City donor’s donation gets matched six to one, up to $175. So a $175 donation from someone in New York City actually is a $1,225 donation because of matching funds. Every dollar counts when it comes to local New York City politics, because every dollar is seven dollars.

If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution.

Access to Other Information The Website maintains records containing personal information about contributors, or information that can be identified or associated with a particular contributor, for the purposes of providing public disclosure, as part of the CFB’s routine business as an agency of the City of New York, in furtherance of its missions and duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York. Examples of this information include the name of the Campaign receiving the contribution, a contributor’s address, employer, or occupation, and the amount of the contributor’s contribution. To the extent these records contain information that is not considered confidential, such information may be disclosed to the public, posted on the CFB website, or made available to the campaign through Website as part of the contribution information. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution.

Using the Website Contribute is an Internet-based service that allows you to make contributions to a Campaign via the Internet using your credit or debit card. By using the Website you instruct Stripe, the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to debit or charge your Account, which allows your contribution to be forwarded to the Campaign, based on the Campaign’s agreement with its payment processor and the contribution instructions you provide on the Website, subject to this Agreement.

The contribution must be made in U.S. dollars and is not tax-deductible.  The contribution must be made from your own funds and not from funds provided to you by another person or entity. The Account must be your own and must be a personal account, not a business account. You authorize the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to electronically order the Financial Institution to debit (i.e., make a charge against) your Account in the amount you specify and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, to your Account as may be necessary to make the contribution and to correct any error.

Once you complete a transaction on the Website, your authorization to debit or charge your Account for this specific contribution shall remain in full force. Your contribution is considered approved when you receive an online confirmation.

You agree not to use the Website in an amount that will exceed the funds or available credit line in your Account. If you do, the Campaign has no obligation to complete the transaction and you agree that the Campaign may debit your Account for its payment processor’s returned item fee or other similar fee. Your use of your Account may be limited by your agreement with your Financial Institution and by applicable law. Neither the Campaign nor the CFB is responsible for not completing a transaction as a result of any such limit on your Account and are not responsible if your Financial Institution fails to honor any charge or debit against your Account. At the Campaign’s payment processor’s sole discretion, it may refuse to complete any transaction, which it has reason to believe is not made by you, may violate any law, rule or regulation, or if it has reasonable cause not to honor it.

All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this

will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not

media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an

relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to

NYC Votes! Who We Are In this Section: Contact Us NYC Votes is an initiative of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, the independent city agency that ensures local elections are fair, inclusive, and open. We boost participation among voters and candidates alike so that our elected officials address the needs of our diverse communities and the issues voters care about. We do this by empowering New Yorkers who are less likely to vote, reducing barriers to running for office, and offering solutions to improve our election system. NYC Votes partners with community organizations, volunteers, and other city agencies to register, educate, and engage voters across the city. We aim to build a greater understanding of the electoral process for all New Yorkers by having an honest dialogue about how our elections work and why they matter . Established in 1988, the agency also equips New Yorkers with information about the candidates on their ballot and how their campaigns are funded. Our matching funds program matches every $1 from a local donor with up to $8 of city funding, encouraging city candidates to focus on their communities instead of special interests.

Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections? Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results? The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day. However, these results will not include any absentee ballot votes. After they receive all absentee ballots, they will finish counting and release certified final results.

The Board of Elections’ ballot tracker will let you know the status of your ballot after you submit a request. It will also let you know if they have received your completed ballot and whether it’s valid. Track your ballot Can I fix my absentee ballot if I made a mistake? The Board of Elections is required by law to notify you if there is a curable error on your ballot envelope, such as a missing or incorrect signature. If there is a fixable error on your ballot, they will contact you by mail, email, and phone (if available) within 1 day of discovering the error. You will then have a minimum of 5 days to correct the error by returning a signed affirmation. Learn more about voting by mail Can I vote absentee in person? Sounds strange, but it’s true! You can vote absentee in person at your borough’s Board of Elections office. Offices are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, and on the weekend prior to Election Day.

You have the right to vote as long as you are a registered voter in line by 9pm on Election Day. Learn more about Election Day Will I know who won on Election Day? Maybe, but don’t be surprised if we have to wait a few weeks.

It is the campaign’s responsibility to report your contribution correctly and claim it for matching funds. What happens to my money when I contribute to a campaign? Candidates running for local New York City office have the option of using Contribute as their online fundraising platform.

Stripe , the credit card processor Contribute uses to direct funds to your bank account, charges a nominal and standard fee (2.9% + $0.30) for each contribution. Stripe will deduct the fee from each contribution prior to funds being deposited into your committee’s bank account. I used Contribute for a previous election cycle. Do I need to create a new account for the current election cycle? If you had a Contribute account in a previous election cycle, you can simply log in using your existing email and password, then you will be prompted to connect to a Stripe account. If you ran in a previous election, you cannot reuse an old Stripe account. After logging into your Contribute account, you must create a new Stripe account by using an email address that is easily accessible by the candidate, treasurer, and anyone else monitoring your Contribute account, as time-sensitive emails may be sent by Stripe to this email address. How do I sign up for Contribute? 1.    Sign up at contribute.nycvotes.org/signup After registering with the CFB, your campaign will have access to Contribute.

Only candidates and treasurers are eligible to have a Contribute account. Best practice: Both the candidate and treasurer should create their own Contribute accounts to receive important communications from Contribute@nyccfb.info. 3.    Agree to the affirmation statement Review the affirmation statement and click I Agree . 4.    Activate your account and connect with Stripe You will receive an email, which will prompt you to activate your Contribute account.

Your Stripe account is separate from your Contribute account and will be used to process contributions made to your campaign on Contribute to your campaign’s bank account.

You will need to complete fields such as: Type of business: Select “Nonprofit Organization” Legal business name: Enter the committee’s name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select “Political Organization” How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select “Within One Day” Executive Details: The campaign’s Stripe account should be created by the candidate (strongly recommended), treasurer, or another campaign representative with significant managerial control.

Credit Card Statement Details: In this section, you will be able to customize how contributions made to your campaign will appear on your contributors’ bank statements.

Receive Contribute link After creating your Stripe account, you will receive an email that confirms that your Contribute account has been connected to Stripe, and that contains your unique Contribute link. This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART? After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds.

If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.    Sign in to your campaign’s Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.    Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. Contributions received via Fundraising Events will be included in the total number of contributions that appear under this alert. To upload data from Contribute, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Contribute will alert you if you have any contributions that have not been uploaded to C-SMART. You will be able to use the upload function only if there are contributions that have not yet been uploaded to C-SMART. What should I do after uploading contributions to C-SMART? 1.    Review each contribution in C-SMART Review the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to ensure that each contribution was uploaded. For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

If you accidentally close an event before it has occurred, the event can be re-opened. Contact your Candidate Services liaison if you need to re-open an event. To customize the contribution amounts for your event page, click on the Tools tab on the event’s administrative page and update the amounts under Custom Amount Tool.

Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time? From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors? For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer.

From your Stripe Dashboard: Find the contribution to be refunded in the Payments overview page. Click the ••• icon to the right of the charge and select Refund charge. Enter the amount to be refunded. The default is a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a different amount to be refunded. Select a reason for the refund.

To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each event’s administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time? Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements? Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. How can we help you? Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election?  It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections?  Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results?  The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day.

This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account?  Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART?  After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds. IMPORTANT: Do not manually enter C-SMART contributions received via Contribute. If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.    Sign in to your campaign’s Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.    Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. Contributions received via Fundraising Events will be included in the total number of contributions that appear under this alert. To upload data from Contribute, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Contribute will alert you if you have any contributions that have not been uploaded to C-SMART. You will be able to use the upload function only if there are contributions that have not yet been uploaded to C-SMART. What should I do after uploading contributions to C-SMART?  1.    Review each contribution in C-SMART Review the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to ensure that each contribution was uploaded. For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART?  In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?  A fundraiser is an event that is organized and sponsored by your campaign. For each fundraiser held by your campaign, you must disclose the following information to the CFB: Date of the event Location of the event List of all contributions received at the event Any persons or organization(s) other than the campaign hosting the event Itemized list of all expenditures related to the event, whether the campaign or another host paid for them You can create distinct contribution pages on Contribute for fundraisers organized by your campaign. This will allow you to accept contributions for those fundraisers and simplify the reporting of the event’s name, location, date, and contributions received. 1.    View events and create a new event From the Fundraising Events tab you can create, view, and manage upcoming and past events. 2.    Enter event details Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*); Venue Name and Start and End Time are optional fields. 3.    Share event page with supporters After successfully creating an event, you will be directed to the Share tab found in the event’s administrative page. From here, you will find links to the event page, social media tools to share through different platforms, and HTML codes that can be used to embed the event page on your campaign’s website, emails, and social media pages. The Status of the event will now be Open , meaning contributions can now be collected for this event. IMPORTANT: After an event has occurred, it should be closed to stop new contributions from being made. From the Edit tab in the event’s administrative page, select Close Event . All contributions received via the Fundraising Event feature must be reported to the CFB within the disclosure period in which the event occurred. How do I edit and review fundraising event pages?  1.    Edit event If you would like to make changes to an event, from the event’s administrative page select the Edit tab. From the Edit tab you can update event details and close, open, or delete the event. Deleting an event is only possible if no contributions have been made for that event. This action cannot be undone. You will receive an email for any modifications made to your event. If event details are modified after the event has been uploaded to C-SMART, use the details in this email to make the necessary changes to the event in C-SMART. If you accidentally close an event before it has occurred, the event can be re-opened. Contact your Candidate Services liaison if you need to re-open an event. To customize the contribution amounts for your event page, click on the Tools tab on the event’s administrative page and update the amounts under Custom Amount Tool. Make sure to click Save New Defaults when you’re finished. If you would like to show fewer than five contribution amounts, enter $0 in any of the contribution amount fields. Amounts of $0 will not appear on your fundraising event page. 2.    Manage and view events Return to the Fundraising Events tab to view your events. Events can be sorted by Event Date and Time , Event Name , Status , and Total Contributions by clicking on each header. Click Preview to view the event page that will be shared with contributors. To return to the event’s administrative page, click the hyperlinked event name or click the gear icon and select Edit . 3.    Review fundraising events and contributions From the Contributions tab on the event’s administrative page, individual contributions can be sorted by Date and Time received, Name of contributor, and Amount contributed. From this page, you can also export the list of contributions received through this event page as a CSV file. Like any other contribution received through Contribute, contributions made to events must be reported within the same disclosure period in which they are received and uploaded directly to C-SMART. Contributions made to events must also be claimed for match like any other eligible contribution. Note: As with other contributions received in Contribute, Stripe processing fees are deducted from contributions received through fundraising event pages. Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time?  From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors?  For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer. When refunding a prohibited contribution via Stripe, remember that to be considered resolved, the refund cannot be pending and must have cleared your campaign bank account . From your Stripe Dashboard: Find the contribution to be refunded in the Payments overview page. Click the ••• icon to the right of the charge and select Refund charge. Enter the amount to be refunded. The default is a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a different amount to be refunded. Select a reason for the refund. If you select Other, you must provide an explanatory note that is attached to the refund. Note: the reason entered is for your campaign and Stripe’s records only and is not shared with the CFB. Click Refund . To document the refund in C-SMART, once it has cleared your bank account: While in Stripe, under “Payments - Refunded”, search for your contributor by first name, last name. Identify the specific contribution that was refunded. Click directly on that contribution to open the refund details. Save the entire refund details screen as a PDF by clicking “CTRL+P” and then instead of printing, select “Save as PDF. In C-SMART, add the monetary contribution refund. You can enter “Stripe” as the Check Number. Upload the entire PDF of your Stripe refund details as your refund documentation in C-SMART. For instructions, see Monetary Contribution Refund Documentation in C-SMART Help. How do I embed Contribute on my campaign’s website and customize contribution amounts?  In the Tools tab of your account page, you will be able to set the contribution amounts that appear on your contribution page. You will also find the HTML code to embed your contribution page on your website, in your campaign emails, and on your social media pages. To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each event’s administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time?  Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States?  Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?  Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. Still have questions? Contact us on social media!

Designed for iPad #92 in News 4.8 â¢ 66K Ratings 4.8 â¢ 66K Ratings   Free Free Screenshots iPad iPhone Apple TV   Description Get local news, weather, traffic, and much more from News 12, the news network dedicated to covering Long Island, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Connecticut, New Jersey, Westchester and Hudson Valley.

I love News12 for all their great updates, especially the weather updates.  I watched all the updates tonight, 7/29, and was glued to all the tornado warnings that Dave Curran and Justin Godynick were presenting.   I give Dave 5 stars for not only his presentation, but for explaining to the common people (not meteorologists) how and why tornadoes happen.   He used his pen in hand and his arms to educate us.  That made me watch and listen even more intently.  Also, last weekend, when the tornado warnings were in MY area (Carteret, Avenel, Port Reading, Colonia), my daughter and I were in the basement in case anything happened and my daughter put the News12 app on my phone so I could watch while she warned others.  I wonât watch any other station except News13 BECAUSE you are so thorough, informative, and educational. Thanks, Nancy in Rahway   Cannabusdriver , Copy and paste news Every article is a copy from another publication and most, if not all, have terrible spelling and grammar. Nothing original. Itâs worse when trying to view a 1 minute video. You have to sit through a 15-30 second commercial to watch a 5 second highlight. Forget about trying to browse through pictures. You canât swipe through without swiping to another story. You canât click through because the forward and reverse buttons are on top of each other. News articles are not updated daily. Iâve seen the same article highlighted about kid that assaulted some woman in Westport for the last 6 months, while others have been posted and removed. Not defending the kid but it certainly seems like there is an agenda here. Who is editing and curating this ânewsâ? Itâs utterly laughable this app is part of a multi billion corporation. This should supplement the channel, not hinder it or ruin its value and reputation, albeit slim as it is already. There are other, national news organizations that provide better local news coverage than âyour local news 12â. Itâs also laughable when that is a rebuttal they use when you tell them you want to cancel their service. âYouâll lose channel 12 access and local news coverage of you switch to any other provider.â Good riddance. Utter trash.   2 Sea , Horrible!!!!!!!! New update makes the app pretty much useless. Why would you take away features?! Itâs unorganized, hard to navigate, the weather section is just awful, I canât find the weather radar and other useful weather features, live feature or the traffic updates seem to have vanished, the layout is not user friendly, when you click on an article the video automatically starts to play which is super annoying, it isnât updated regularly, there is hardly any new content which is probably why old news is mixed in, videos donât always work and are preceded by endless ads which is inconvenient,  and itâs visually unappealing . Also the articles have many spelling and grammar errors.   I donât understand the need to constantly âfixâ things and make them virtually unusable when they were decent before.  Each update seems to make things worse.  I barely use the app now thatâs been âupdatedâ. I look elsewhere for Long Island weather, traffic, and news.  I wish News 12 would make it easy to access traffic and weather quickly. Now thereâs really no point to this app!
