Our district is home to vibrant communities with deep immigrant roots, strong small businesses, and families who have lived here for generations. It’s a place where working people, seniors, and young families alike deserve a city government that listens, protects, and invests in them. For decades, District 19 has been shaped by hardworking New Yorkers who built thriving communities while fighting for better schools, safer streets, and local businesses. But too often, the needs of our neighborhoods have been ignored in favor of big developers, corporate interests, and short-sighted policies that don’t put our communities first. The district has changed in recent years due to the 2022 redistricting process by the New York City Districting Commission , which reshaped City Council lines to reflect the latest census data. The new District 19 remains a diverse and dynamic part of Queens, and as your City Council Member, Youn will ensure that every neighborhood in our district receives the resources, investment, and leadership it deserves.
