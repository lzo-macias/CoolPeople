Defendant Liliana Trafficante is currently scheduled to be sentenced on January 24, 2011. The Court finds that the information provided by the Parties and Probation is not sufficient for the Court to determine the appropriate sentence for the Defendant. The Government is DIRECTED to contact the appropriate state agencies regarding the foster child and obtain a written report within 60 days of the date of this Order informing the Court what role the state would play regarding the well-being of this child should the mother be incarcerated. Once the Court and the Parties have the report from the appropriate state agencies, the Parties will have 30 days to respond to the state agencies' submissions. Defendant Trafficante's sentence is adjourned sine die. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Deborah A. Batts on 1/19/2011)(bw) (Entered: 01/20/2011) Main Doc ¬≠ument ¬≠ument  18 Mar 18, 2011 ORDER as to Liliana Trafficante. The Court is in receipt of the govt's letter of March 16, 2011 which purports to respond to the Court's Order of January 19, 2011 and the Court finds the Govt's letter woefully insufficient... The Court wants a definitive answer on the legal status of dft's relationship with the child: completed adoption, legal custody or foster care.... Any documentation regarding any of the Court's queries which Defense Counsel can supply would be helpful to the Court. Again, the Parties have 60 days to comply with this second Order of the Court.

Batts to 41 months in prison for her leadership role in a five-year scheme to obtain money from investors by claiming that the money would be used for a project intended to help foster children, when in fact TRAFFICANTE spent much of the money on personal expenses and other purposes.  TRAFFICANTE pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2010, and agreed to pay restitution to the victims of her offense, pursuant to a plan to be set by the Court. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: ‚ÄúInstead of developing water parks for foster children as she said she would, Liliana Trafficante used the money to support her own lifestyle. In doing so, she exploited a worthy cause for personal gain, cheating foster kids out of an opportunity to truly benefit from the investors‚Äô contributions.‚Äù According to the charging documents in the case and statements made in open court today at the sentencing proceeding: LILIANA TRAFFICANTE held herself out as the founder and Chief Executive Officer of International Dreams, a Manhattan-based entity.  In addition, she is the principal of, or otherwise affiliated with, a number of entities that appear to be related to International Dreams, including GoOcean Park and Resort LLC, Bouchville Manors, The Little Water Park That Could, and Signature A (collectively, the ‚ÄúTrafficante Entities‚Äù).  TRAFFICANTE claimed to be raising money for the purchase of land and completion of a water park for foster children (the ‚ÄúWater Park Project‚Äù).  Among other methods, TRAFFICANTE raised money through postings on the Craigslist website.  TRAFFICANTE made numerous false statements to individuals in order to induce them to make loans to and/or investments in the Trafficante Entities. For example, according to the Complaint, TRAFFICANTE told one individual that land had been located for the Water Park Project.  TRAFFICANTE claimed that the land was rich with natural resources, the exploration of which prior to construction could help fund the Water Park Project.  Based on these representations, the individual loaned $100,000 to one of the Trafficante Entities.  In connection with this loan, TRAFFICANTE and this individual executed a promissory note that stated that the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of the $100,000 loan was to help ‚ÄúGoOcean Water Park & Resort purchase excavating equipment.‚Äù  In fact, no land had been purchased by TRAFFICANTE for a water park, or for any other purpose, and the money was not used for equipment of any kind.  Rather, among other non-equipment payments, TRAFFICANTE made $40,000 in rent payments on behalf of family members the same day that the $100,000 was wired to an account she controlled. In addition to the prison term, Judge Batts sentenced TRAFFICANTE to three years of supervised release.  TRAFFICANTE also was ordered to pay restitution of $750,000, as well as a $100 special assessment fee. Mr. Bharara praised the work of the FBI, which investigated this case. Today‚Äôs announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama‚Äôs Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys‚Äô offices and state and local partners, it‚Äôs the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since the inception of FFETF in November 2009, the Justice Department has filed more than 12,841 financial fraud cases against nearly 18,737 defendants including nearly 3,500 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov . This case is being handled by the Office‚Äôs Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Ingoglia is in charge of the prosecution.

Rather, among other non-equipment payments, TRAFFICANTE made $40,000 in rent payments on behalf of family members the same day that the $100,000 was wired to an account she controlled. In addition to the prison term, Judge Batts sentenced TRAFFICANTE to three years of supervised release.  TRAFFICANTE also was ordered to pay restitution of $750,000, as well as a $100 special assessment fee. Mr. Bharara praised the work of the FBI, which investigated this case. Today‚Äôs announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama‚Äôs Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys‚Äô offices and state and local partners, it‚Äôs the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since the inception of FFETF in November 2009, the Justice Department has filed more than 12,841 financial fraud cases against nearly 18,737 defendants including nearly 3,500 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov . This case is being handled by the Office‚Äôs Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Ingoglia is in charge of the prosecution.

Below is an overview of its practice areas. Civil Frauds The Civil Frauds Unit (the ‚ÄúCiFU‚Äù) investigates and prosecutes large-scale and sophisticated frauds committed against the government and financial institutions in a wide array of areas, including health care fraud, financial fraud, procurement fraud, grant fraud, mortgage fraud, customs fraud, federal program fraud, and other schemes that harm the public fisc and undermine government priorities.¬† The CiFU‚Äôs most powerful tool is the False Claims Act, in the context of which the CiFU frequently works with whistleblowers to investigate, expose, and combat fraud and abuse of government funds ‚Äî frequently obtaining substantial monetary recoveries, public admissions of misconduct from defendants, and, where appropriate, injunctive relief.¬† For example, in its health care fraud practice, the CiFU has brought and resolved many innovative, high-impact False Claims Act cases, including matters addressing kickbacks to medical providers, fraudulent billing, medical device fraud, fraud in the Medicare Part C program, and fraud and abuse in residential care facilities.¬† The CiFU also regularly partners with the Office‚Äôs Criminal Division in the area of health care fraud, including, for example in the recent prosecution and resolution of False Claims Act cases against a medical device company and an ophthalmology practice, both for fraudulent billing. The CiFU enforces the False Claims Act in many other areas as well.¬† For instance, the CiFU maintains a robust customs fraud practice, prosecuting schemes involving the intentional undervaluing of goods imported into the United States, the misclassification of goods under federal tariff schedules, and more.¬† The CiFU has also brought notable cases involving violations of the Controlled Substances Act (including the first prosecution of executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself for trafficking opioids), the fraudulent use of federal research grants and federal program funds intended to benefit underserved groups. In addition, the CIFU has a long track record of bringing important cases under the False Claims Act, the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act ("FIRREA"), and other statutes to address major financial frauds.¬† In particular, the CiFU brought the Department of Justice's first mortgage fraud lawsuits against major Wall Street financial institutions for engaging in reckless lending practices prior to the financial crisis, recovering over a billion dollars from those institutions. ¬†The CiFU has continued its pursuit of sophisticated financial wrongdoing, for example bringing False Claims Act and FIRREA matters against major banks for schemes to overcharge their foreign exchange customers.¬† The CiFU continues to investigate fraud and abuse in new and evolving areas, including, for example, cyber fraud and fraud relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related relief programs. Environmental Protection and Public Health The Environmental Protection Unit protects the environment and public health in the Southern District of New York and beyond.¬†Our matters include enforcement under traditional environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act , Safe Drinking Water Act , and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‚ÄúRCRA‚Äù) ; protection of the public from lead paint and other health threats in housing ; preventing the sale of unregistered pesticide s ;¬†and food safety . The Environmental Protection Unit also defends the United States in lawsuits under environmental, natural resources, and wildlife laws.¬† These matters include challenges to regulations and other formal actions by environmental agencies; claims that agencies failed to give environmental issues a ‚Äúhard look‚Äù where required under the National Environmental Protection Act; and requests for courts to compel environmental agencies to take actions that they have not taken. We encourage members of the public to bring environmental concerns relating to the Southern District of New York to our attention.¬† If you wish to do so, please send an email to USANYS.Environmental@usdoj.gov and describe the concerns in as much detail as possible. General Defensive Litigation The Civil Division has a diverse and challenging general defensive litigation practice. ¬†Civil Division AUSAs defend against constitutional challenges to federal statutes and regulations; suits to overturn government policies and programs; and attacks on the legality of government decisions. ¬†Civil Division AUSAs also represent individual employees in suits brought against them for actions taken in the scope of their federal employment and represent the United States and its agencies and officers in employment discrimination and tort cases, Freedom of Information Act litigation, and many other cases. National Security and Foreign Policy The Civil Division litigates a wide range of cases implicating the national security, national defense, and foreign relations of the United States.¬† Civil Division AUSAs have handled cases ranging from the assertion of the foreign policy interests of the United States in federal court to defending against challenges to the activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement. The Civil Division also advises federal courts on matters implicating the immunity of foreign governments, heads of state, and the United Nations. ¬†Civil Division AUSAs also handle litigation to protect classified national security information from disclosure, including through assertion of the state secrets privilege. Cases often arise in the context of requests for federal agency records under the Freedom of Information Act or third-party requests for discovery from agencies. Tax and Bankruptcy SDNY is one of the only U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Offices that represents the United States and its agencies in bankruptcy proceedings and civil tax litigation. The Office‚Äôs bankruptcy practice is remarkably diverse and sophisticated, as Civil Division AUSAs have represented the federal government in some of the biggest and most significant bankruptcies in United States history.¬† These matters include bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears and Lehman Brothers). Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including filing affirmative cases to collect millions of dollars of unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for failures to report foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases in which sophisticated corporate entities engage in transactions that lack economic substance to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to prevent abusive tax preparers and tax shelter promoters from operating. Appeals Civil Division AUSAs brief and argue all appeals from their own cases, typically in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.¬† Supervisors in the Appeals Unit works closely with the AUSAs to help prepare the briefs and oral arguments, whether the Government is appealing a judgment against it, defending a ruling in its favor, or advising the court of the Government‚Äôs views through an amicus curiae brief.¬† The Appeals Unit also assists the Solicitor General in preparing briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court that arise from cases handled by this Office.

(‚ÄúGramercy Cardiac‚Äù), alleging that he paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to physicians and their practices for patient referrals.¬† The kickbacks took the form of inflated office ‚Äúrental payments‚Äù and fees paid to contracted cardiologists. $678 Million Anti-Kickback Statute Settlement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals for Operating Sham Speaker Programs : ¬†In 2020, the Office reached a $678 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (‚ÄúNovartis‚Äù), resolving claims that Novartis violated the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute by providing doctors with cash payments, recreational outings, lavish meals, and expensive alcohol to induce them to prescribe Novartis‚Äôs cardiovascular and diabetes drugs, which were then reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. ¬†The Government alleged that Novartis organized tens of thousands of sham speaker events at high-end restaurants and other venues and paid exorbitant speaker fees to doctors who gave no meaningful presentations. ¬†When those doctors then prescribed Novartis‚Äôs drugs, federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for these tainted prescriptions. Healthcare Fraud ‚Äì Fraudulent Billing Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Medical Device Company for Creating and Selling a Fake Medical Component That Was Implanted Into Patients : ¬†In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Stimwave LLC (‚ÄúStimwave‚Äù), a Florida-based medical device company, alleging that Stimwave created and sold a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.¬† Under the civil settlement, Stimwave agreed to pay $8.6 million to the United States.¬† Simultaneous with the resolution of the civil case, the SDNY‚Äôs Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit announced the filing of criminal charges against the former CEO of Stimwave for her role in the fraudulent scheme. $49 Million Settlement with Biotech Testing Company for Fraudulent Billing and Kickback Practices :¬† In 2020, the Office resolved claims against Progenity, Inc. (‚ÄúProgenity‚Äù), a biotechnology company that provides molecular and diagnostic tests, for fraudulently billing federal healthcare programs for prenatal tests and providing kickbacks to physicians to induce them to order Progenity tests for their patients.¬† As alleged in the lawsuit, Progenity fraudulently used a billing code that misrepresented the tests provided and provided illegal kickbacks in the form of excessive ‚Äúdraw fees‚Äù to physicians, meals and happy hours for physicians and their staff, and the improper reduction or waiver of patient coinsurance and deductible payments.¬† Under the settlement, Progenity agreed to pay a total of $49 million to resolve various governmental claims. $40.5 Million Settlement with Durable Medical Equipment Provider for Fraudulent Billing Practices : ¬†In 2020, Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. and its affiliate, Apria Healthcare LLC (together, ‚ÄúApria‚Äù) agreed to pay a total of $40.5 million to resolve governmental claims that, among other things, Apria submitted false claims to federal healthcare programs seeking reimbursement for the rental of costly non-invasive ventilators to program beneficiaries.¬† As alleged, those beneficiaries were not using the non-invasive ventilators, such that the devices were not medically necessary; Apria admitted that it continued to seek reimbursement from federal programs after it had information that patients had stopped using their ventilators.¬† In addition, the government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that Apria improperly waived patient co-insurance payments for the devices. Healthcare Fraud ‚Äì Elder Care $7.85 Million Settlement with Skilled Nursing Facility for Fraudulently Switching Residents‚Äô Healthcare Coverage to Boost Medicare Payments :¬† In 2022, the Office settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against Plaza Rehab and Nursing Center (‚ÄúPlaza Rehab Center‚Äù) and Citadel Consulting Group LLC (‚ÄúCitadel‚Äù), which alleged that Plaza Rehab Center, acting at the direction of Citadel, fraudulently switched the type of Medicare coverage in which elderly residents were enrolled in order to maximize the Medicare payments that Plaza Rehab Center would receive.¬† The residents and their families often did not request, consent to, or know about the change to their healthcare coverage, which had the potential to impact their out-of-pocket payments, the scope of the services and care covered, and their drug coverage plan.¬† As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $7.85 million. Settlement of Lawsuit Alleging that Bronx Nursing Home Paid Kickbacks for Patient Referrals and Switched Residents‚Äô Healthcare Coverage Without Their Consent :¬† In 2023, the Office settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Morris Park Nursing Home (‚ÄúMorris Park‚Äù), a skilled nursing facility located in the Bronx, New York, and individuals formerly associated with Morris Park.¬† The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes that violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute.¬† The first scheme involved cash payments made to a supervisor at a nearby hospital for patient referrals, and the second scheme involved switching residents‚Äô Medicare coverage without their consent in order to increase the Medicare payments that Morris Park received.¬† Under the settlements, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $3.46 million. Healthcare Fraud ‚Äì Medicare Part C Fraud $37 Million Medicare Part C Fraud Settlement with Cigna : ¬†In 2023, the Office reached a $37 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against The Cigna Group (‚ÄúCigna‚Äù) and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations.¬† The settlement resolved claims that Cigna submitted to the government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments it received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.¬† The government alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by Cigna to conduct in-home assessments of plan members, and that the healthcare providers who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported. Healthcare Fraud ‚Äì Pharmaceutical Fraud $269.2 Million Recoveries in Healthcare Fraud Settlements with Walgreens : ¬†In 2019, the Office¬†filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (‚ÄúWalgreens‚Äù) for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens‚Äôs improper billings to government healthcare programs.¬† The lawsuit alleged that Walgreens improperly billed the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens sought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated prices. Violations of the Controlled Substances Act $20 Million Dollar Settlement with Rochester Drug Cooperative for Failing to Report Suspicious Orders of Controlled Substances to the DEA :¬† In 2019, Rochester Drug Cooperative (‚ÄúRDC‚Äù), a wholesale drug distributor, agreed to pay a $20 million penalty to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Office under the Controlled Substances Act.¬† The complaint alleged that between May 2012 and November 2016, RDC knowingly failed to comply with its legal obligation to report thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as Oxycodone and fentanyl, despite being aware that many of its largest pharmacy customers exhibited ‚Äúred flags‚Äù associated with the diversion of such drugs. The Office‚Äôs investigation also ultimately led to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with RDC and a first-of-its-kind felony conviction of RDC‚Äôs former CEO for conspiring to unlawfully distribute controlled substances and defrauding the DEA. Financial Fraud $72.6 Million Settlement of Fraud Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo Bank for Overcharging Foreign Exchange Customers :¬† In 2021, Wells Fargo Bank (‚ÄúWells Fargo‚Äù) agreed to pay a total of approximately $72.6 million to resolve claims brought under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, alleging that Wells Fargo fraudulently overcharged hundreds of commercial customers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses and federally-insured financial institutions, who used Wells Fargo‚Äôs foreign exchange (‚ÄúFX‚Äù) service.¬† The suit alleged that from 2010 through 2017, Wells Fargo FX sales specialists defrauded nearly 800 customers by systematically charging them higher markups on FX transactions than they represented Wells Fargo would charge and concealing those overcharges through various misrepresentations and deceptive practices. Program and Grant Fraud Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Former Hunter College Professor and Hunter College for Fraudulently Using Federal Research Funds :¬† In 2023, the Office resolved claims under the False Claims Act against Jeffrey T. Parsons-Hietikko (‚ÄúParsons‚Äù), a former psychology professor at Hunter College (‚ÄúHunter‚Äù), and Hunter, for the fraudulent misuse of research grant funds provided by the National Institutes of Health (‚ÄúNIH‚Äù).¬† Parsons previously served as Director of Hunter‚Äôs Center for HIV Educational Studies (‚ÄúCHEST‚Äù).¬† Among other things, the government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that for years, Parsons improperly invoiced personal expenses to NIH funds, including expenses relating to scuba diving trips, international flights for his family, and a tropical birthday celebration.¬† The lawsuit further alleged that Hunter used NIH funds to pay Parsons tens of thousands of dollars in retention bonuses without disclosing those payments to NIH as required, and that Parsons and Hunter submitted false timekeeping records that resulted in the use of NIH grant funds to compensate CHEST staff for work performed for Parsons‚Äôs private clients.¬† Under the settlement, Parsons and Hunter agreed to pay $375,000 and $200,000, respectively. Settlements in Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Three Companies for False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation on Federal Construction Projects :¬† In 2019 and 2021 , the Office resolved claims against three companies for their roles in a scheme to make false statements about disadvantaged business participation on two federal construction projects.¬† Under Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (‚ÄúDBE‚Äù) rules, contracts for certain federally funded projects require the participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.¬† The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that, in connection with federally funded steel painting projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza, Ahern Painting Contractors Co. misrepresented that Tower Maintenance Corp., a certified DBE, was solely performing millions of dollars of work on the two projects.¬† In fact, much of that work was being performed by Spectrum Painting Corp., a non-DBE.¬† Under the settlements, the three defendants agreed to pay over $3.5 million. $5.3 Million Settlement of Lawsuit Against New York City for Fraudulently Obtaining FEMA Funds Following Superstorm Sandy :¬† In 2019, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against the City of New York (the ‚ÄúCity‚Äù) alleging that the New York City Department of Transportation (‚ÄúNYCDOT‚Äù) fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by falsely claiming that numerous NYCDOT vehicles were damaged during Superstorm Sandy.¬† Under the settlement, the City agreed to pay $5.3 million.

Settlement of Customs Fraud Suit Against Clothing Companies and Their Former CEO for Misrepresenting the Value of Goods to Avoid Paying Customs Duties :¬† In 2021, the Office resolved a lawsuit against Stargate Apparel, Inc., Rivstar Apparel, Inc., and Joseph Bailey (the former CEO and owner of both companies), for employing a variety of schemes to defraud the United States of millions of dollars in customs duties, by submitting invoices to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that falsely understated the true value of the clothing they imported into the United States.¬† Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $6 million.¬† This civil settlement was in addition to a $1,661,617 forfeiture amount that Bailey was ordered to pay in parallel criminal proceedings handled by the Office‚Äôs Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit.

District Court Rules That MTA‚Äô Renovation Of Subway Station Triggered MTA‚Äôs Obligation Under ADA To Install Elevators Unless Technically Infeasible : The Office obtained a major ruling against the Metropolitan Transit Authority (‚ÄúMTA‚Äù) and New York City Transit Authority to increase the accessibility of the New York City subway system.¬† The ruling effectively requires MTA to install elevators when conducting certain station renovations, without regard to cost, unless it is technically infeasible to do so.¬† In the wake of the ruling, MTA has worked to dramatically increase the number of accessible stations throughout the City. The Office has entered into Voluntary Compliance Agreements with a number of summer camps, requiring them to implement policies to accommodate the needs of children with disabilities and train all personnel who may interact with prospective and enrolled campers and camp visitors.

Superfund and Related Litigation In the Tronox bankruptcy, after years of litigation and negotiation, the Office entered into a settlement recovering more than $4.4 billion from affiliates of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation for environmental claims and liabilities.¬† This settlement constituted the largest litigation recovery by the United States for the clean-up of environmental contamination. Other Superfund litigation and settlements can be found here . Food Safety The Office works closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs to pursue violations of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act. Food safety litigation and settlements can be found here . General Defensive Litigation Constitutional and Program Litigation The Office defends the Executive Office of the President, the Cabinet, other government officials, and most federal agencies and departments of the Executive Branch in civil actions challenging the legality of federal policies and programs. ¬†Much of the Civil Division‚Äôs work in this area involves high-profile lawsuits, novel issues of constitutional and administrative law, and important issues of public policy. ¬†This category includes cases brought against federal officials in both their individual and official capacity. Litigation can range from single-plaintiff actions to complex nationwide class actions. ¬†AUSAs handling these cases often must coordinate with the involved federal agencies, as well as with senior leadership within the Department of Justice. In its Constitutional Law practice, the Civil Division defends actions challenging the constitutionality of federal statutes, regulations, or policies, or the actions of individual federal employees. ¬†For example, the Civil Division recently intervened in People of the State of New York v. Arm or Ally, LLC , 22 Civ. 6124, to defend against a Second Amendment challenge to the Gun Control Act and a recent regulation enacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that makes clear the Act‚Äôs requirements apply to ghost guns. ¬†And Civil Division AUSAs are currently representing the United States Military Academy at West Point in a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the use of race as a factor in admissions, as a violation of Equal Protection ( see Students for Fair Admissions v. United States Military Academy at West Point , 23 Civ. 8262). Many of these cases involve cutting edge First Amendment issues. ¬†The Civil Division is defending President Biden and senior White House officials in Berenson v. Biden , 23 Civ. 3048, alleging that the administration‚Äôs attempts to combat the spread of false information regarding COVID-19 vaccines on social media constituted a violation of the First Amendment. ¬†The Civil Division represented the government in a First Amendment challenge to provisions of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act that required NGOs that received federal funding to adopt a policy against prostitution and sex trafficking ( see Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID , 15-974 (2d Cir.)). And in Stagg, PC v. Department of State , 19-811 (2d Cir.), the Civil Division successfully handled a First Amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting the transfer of technical data required for the manufacture of certain munitions to foreign persons. The Civil Division also defends cases challenging government action or inaction under the Administrative Procedure Act (‚ÄúAPA‚Äù), many of which involve novel legal issues and consequential public interests. ¬†For example, Civil Division AUSAs recently successfully defended an APA action challenging hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for licensed home care service agencies located in New York. And SDNY AUSAs have defended a number of challenges to the authority of Administrative Law Judges on the grounds that they are inferior officers who were not properly appointed in accordance with Article II of the United States Constitution. Employment Litigation, Torts, and Medical Malpractice The Civil Division represents the United States, including its officers and agencies, in employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. ¬†The Division also represents the United States in suits for monetary damages alleging negligent or wrongful acts. ¬†And Civil Division AUSAs represents the VA and other federally funded medical providers in lawsuits alleging malpractice. ¬†These matters, which frequently go to trial, often involve complex fact patterns and require engaging with experts on a wide range of topics. National Security and Foreign Policy Representing Foreign Policy Interests The Civil Division is involved in representing the foreign policy interests of the United States: Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , 22 Civ. 5199 (supporting a stay of litigation against Sri Lanka to recover on defaulted sovereign bonds, in order to advance U.S. foreign policy interest in orderly and consensual sovereign debt restructuring); Kunstler v. CIA , 22 Civ. 6913 (alleging that the CIA had unlawfully monitored Julian Assange‚Äôs meetings with third parties while he resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London); Tanvir v. Tanzin , 13 Civ. 6951, 23-738 (2d Cir.) (challenge under the First and Fifth Amendments, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to Plaintiffs‚Äô alleged placement on the No Fly List, which they claimed was due to their refusal to become informants for the FBI). Advising Federal Courts on Foreign Government Immunities Civil Division AUSAs prepare submissions advising judges on issues related to foreign government immunities: Havlish v. The Taliban , 03 Civ. 9848 (statements of interest in actions brought by victims of the September 11 attack to seize funds of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan‚Äôs central bank held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the Taliban‚Äôs takeover of Afghanistan). Protecting Classified National Security Information Civil Division AUSAs handle matters involving the protection of national security information: In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 , 03 MDL 1570 (successfully asserting state secrets and law enforcement privileges to protect certain classified and otherwise sensitive information sought in discovery); New York Times Co. v. CIA , No. 18-2112 (2d Cir.) (litigation regarding refusal by CIA to confirm or deny whether it possessed records involving covert funding of rebel forces in Syria); American Civil Liberties Union v. CIA , No. 18-2265 (2d Cir.) (request for records cited in the publicly released executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence‚Äôs Committee Study of the CIA‚Äôs Detention and Interrogation Program) ; Osen v. CENTCOM , 19 Civ. 6867 (withholding of photographs depicting improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. military vehicles in Iraq); Open Society Justice Initiative v. Department of State et al. , 19 Civ. 234 (requests for records from multiple members of the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi); Osen v. OFAC , 19 Civ. 405 (challenges to withholding of classified information in memoranda and associated intelligence reports that supported the Office of Foreign Asset Control‚Äôs sanction designations of three charities that were determined to be support nodes for Hamas). Tax and Bankruptcy Bankruptcy Civil Division AUSAs represent the interests of the United States in bankruptcy cases filed in the Southern District of New York, including bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears, AIG, and Lehman Brothers).¬† Examples include: In re Purdue Pharma L.P ., No. 23-124 (S. Ct):¬† The Office represents the interests of the United States in the bankruptcy proceeding of Purdue Pharma L.P.¬† Our representation includes advocating on behalf of the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.¬† The Office has also opposed efforts to permit an involuntary third-party release of the Sackler family, who are not debtors in the bankruptcy case, arguing, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Code does not authorize the release of non-debtors from personal liability to other non-debtors. The legality of third-party releases is presently before the Supreme Court. In re Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc . , No. 23 Civ. 2171:¬† In the bankruptcy of a cryptocurrency investment company, the bankruptcy court included a so-called ‚Äúexculpation‚Äù clause in the debtors‚Äô plan, which purported to extinguish (among other things) civil and criminal liability for the debtors‚Äô and various third parties‚Äô future acts.¬† The Office has argued that the Bankruptcy Code does not permit such exculpation and that courts may not involuntarily release the government‚Äôs civil, criminal, and administrative claims. Tax Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including bringing affirmative cases to collect unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for taxpayers‚Äô failures to report their foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases to prevent sophisticated corporate entities from engaging in abusive transactions to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to put fraudulent tax preparers and tax-shelter promoters out of business.¬† Examples include: New York v. Mnuchin , No. 19-3962 (2d Cir.):¬† In this case the States of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland challenged the constitutionality of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that limited the Internal Revenue Code‚Äôs state and local tax deduction for individuals to $10,000.¬† The Office successfully defended the provision in the district court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.¬† Those courts agreed with our arguments that principles of federalism did not constrain Congress‚Äôs ability to limit this deduction and that the provision at issue did not coerce the states to change their own tax systems. AIG v. United States , No. 09 Civ. 1871:¬† This case involved seven cross-border financial transactions that the United States asserted were abusive tax shelters designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits that AIG improperly attempted to use to reduce its tax liabilities in the United States.¬† The Office asserted that these transactions lacked any meaningful economic substance, were devoid of any legitimate business purpose, and instead were designed solely to manufacture hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits to which AIG was not entitled.¬† ¬† According to the terms of the settlement reached in 2020, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that it claimed for the 1997 tax year and all later tax years for these same transactions, totaling more than $400 million, would be disallowed in their entirety.¬† AIG further agreed to pay a 10% tax penalty. United States v. Alvarez , No. 21 Civ. 1930:¬† The Office filed a civil complaint alleging that Rafael Alvarez and his tax-preparation business ATAX New York LLC had prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their clients in which they falsely reduced their clients‚Äô tax liabilities and generated tax refunds to which those clients were not entitled.¬† As part of a settlement in 2021, the defendants admitted that they prepared and filed many federal income tax returns that included claims of expenses, losses, or ‚Äúhead of household‚Äù status that lacked adequate supporting information or documentation, and that these unsupported entries caused the clients‚Äô tax liabilities to be substantially understated.¬† The defendants consented to a permanent injunction that, among other things, prevented them from acting as federal tax return preparers, and they agreed to pay disgorgement. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Civil Division Priorities Share  Facebook X LinkedIn Email Civil Frauds $6.5 Million Settlement with Cardiologist and His Medical Practice for Paying Millions in Kickbacks for Referrals :¬† In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against a cardiologist and his medical practice, Gramercy Cardiac Diagnostic Services P.C.

Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Medical Device Company for Creating and Selling a Fake Medical Component That Was Implanted Into Patients : ¬†In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Stimwave LLC (‚ÄúStimwave‚Äù), a Florida-based medical device company, alleging that Stimwave created and sold a non-functioning dummy medical device for implantation into patients suffering from chronic pain, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to federal healthcare programs.¬† Under the civil settlement, Stimwave agreed to pay $8.6 million to the United States.¬† Simultaneous with the resolution of the civil case, the SDNY‚Äôs Complex Frauds and Cybercrimes Unit announced the filing of criminal charges against the former CEO of Stimwave for her role in the fraudulent scheme. $49 Million Settlement with Biotech Testing Company for Fraudulent Billing and Kickback Practices :¬† In 2020, the Office resolved claims against Progenity, Inc. (‚ÄúProgenity‚Äù), a biotechnology company that provides molecular and diagnostic tests, for fraudulently billing federal healthcare programs for prenatal tests and providing kickbacks to physicians to induce them to order Progenity tests for their patients.¬† As alleged in the lawsuit, Progenity fraudulently used a billing code that misrepresented the tests provided and provided illegal kickbacks in the form of excessive ‚Äúdraw fees‚Äù to physicians, meals and happy hours for physicians and their staff, and the improper reduction or waiver of patient coinsurance and deductible payments.¬† Under the settlement, Progenity agreed to pay a total of $49 million to resolve various governmental claims. $40.5 Million Settlement with Durable Medical Equipment Provider for Fraudulent Billing Practices : ¬†In 2020, Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. and its affiliate, Apria Healthcare LLC (together, ‚ÄúApria‚Äù) agreed to pay a total of $40.5 million to resolve governmental claims that, among other things, Apria submitted false claims to federal healthcare programs seeking reimbursement for the rental of costly non-invasive ventilators to program beneficiaries.¬† As alleged, those beneficiaries were not using the non-invasive ventilators, such that the devices were not medically necessary; Apria admitted that it continued to seek reimbursement from federal programs after it had information that patients had stopped using their ventilators.¬† In addition, the government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that Apria improperly waived patient co-insurance payments for the devices. $7.85 Million Settlement with Skilled Nursing Facility for Fraudulently Switching Residents‚Äô Healthcare Coverage to Boost Medicare Payments :¬† In 2022, the Office settled a civil healthcare fraud lawsuit against Plaza Rehab and Nursing Center (‚ÄúPlaza Rehab Center‚Äù) and Citadel Consulting Group LLC (‚ÄúCitadel‚Äù), which alleged that Plaza Rehab Center, acting at the direction of Citadel, fraudulently switched the type of Medicare coverage in which elderly residents were enrolled in order to maximize the Medicare payments that Plaza Rehab Center would receive.¬† The residents and their families often did not request, consent to, or know about the change to their healthcare coverage, which had the potential to impact their out-of-pocket payments, the scope of the services and care covered, and their drug coverage plan.¬† As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $7.85 million. Settlement of Lawsuit Alleging that Bronx Nursing Home Paid Kickbacks for Patient Referrals and Switched Residents‚Äô Healthcare Coverage Without Their Consent :¬† In 2023, the Office settled a civil fraud lawsuit against Morris Park Nursing Home (‚ÄúMorris Park‚Äù), a skilled nursing facility located in the Bronx, New York, and individuals formerly associated with Morris Park.¬† The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in two fraudulent and illegal schemes that violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute.¬† The first scheme involved cash payments made to a supervisor at a nearby hospital for patient referrals, and the second scheme involved switching residents‚Äô Medicare coverage without their consent in order to increase the Medicare payments that Morris Park received.¬† Under the settlements, the defendants agreed to pay a total of $3.46 million. $37 Million Medicare Part C Fraud Settlement with Cigna : ¬†In 2023, the Office reached a $37 million settlement of its healthcare fraud lawsuit against The Cigna Group (‚ÄúCigna‚Äù) and its subsidiary Medicare Advantage Organizations.¬† The settlement resolved claims that Cigna submitted to the government false and invalid patient diagnosis codes to artificially inflate the payments it received for providing insurance coverage to its Medicare Advantage plan members.¬† The government alleged that the invalid diagnosis codes were based solely on forms completed by vendors retained and paid by Cigna to conduct in-home assessments of plan members, and that the healthcare providers who conducted these home visits did not perform or order the diagnostic testing or imaging that would have been necessary to reliably diagnose the serious, complex conditions reported. $269.2 Million Recoveries in Healthcare Fraud Settlements with Walgreens : ¬†In 2019, the Office¬†filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (‚ÄúWalgreens‚Äù) for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens‚Äôs improper billings to government healthcare programs.¬† The lawsuit alleged that Walgreens improperly billed the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens sought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated prices. $20 Million Dollar Settlement with Rochester Drug Cooperative for Failing to Report Suspicious Orders of Controlled Substances to the DEA :¬† In 2019, Rochester Drug Cooperative (‚ÄúRDC‚Äù), a wholesale drug distributor, agreed to pay a $20 million penalty to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Office under the Controlled Substances Act.¬† The complaint alleged that between May 2012 and November 2016, RDC knowingly failed to comply with its legal obligation to report thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as Oxycodone and fentanyl, despite being aware that many of its largest pharmacy customers exhibited ‚Äúred flags‚Äù associated with the diversion of such drugs. The Office‚Äôs investigation also ultimately led to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with RDC and a first-of-its-kind felony conviction of RDC‚Äôs former CEO for conspiring to unlawfully distribute controlled substances and defrauding the DEA. $72.6 Million Settlement of Fraud Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo Bank for Overcharging Foreign Exchange Customers :¬† In 2021, Wells Fargo Bank (‚ÄúWells Fargo‚Äù) agreed to pay a total of approximately $72.6 million to resolve claims brought under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, alleging that Wells Fargo fraudulently overcharged hundreds of commercial customers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses and federally-insured financial institutions, who used Wells Fargo‚Äôs foreign exchange (‚ÄúFX‚Äù) service.¬† The suit alleged that from 2010 through 2017, Wells Fargo FX sales specialists defrauded nearly 800 customers by systematically charging them higher markups on FX transactions than they represented Wells Fargo would charge and concealing those overcharges through various misrepresentations and deceptive practices. Settlement of Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Former Hunter College Professor and Hunter College for Fraudulently Using Federal Research Funds :¬† In 2023, the Office resolved claims under the False Claims Act against Jeffrey T.

Settlements in Civil Fraud Lawsuit Against Three Companies for False Statements About Disadvantaged Business Participation on Federal Construction Projects :¬† In 2019 and 2021 , the Office resolved claims against three companies for their roles in a scheme to make false statements about disadvantaged business participation on two federal construction projects.¬† Under Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (‚ÄúDBE‚Äù) rules, contracts for certain federally funded projects require the participation of businesses owned by women and minorities.¬† The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that, in connection with federally funded steel painting projects to renovate the Brooklyn Bridge and Queens Plaza, Ahern Painting Contractors Co. misrepresented that Tower Maintenance Corp., a certified DBE, was solely performing millions of dollars of work on the two projects.¬† In fact, much of that work was being performed by Spectrum Painting Corp., a non-DBE.¬† Under the settlements, the three defendants agreed to pay over $3.5 million. $5.3 Million Settlement of Lawsuit Against New York City for Fraudulently Obtaining FEMA Funds Following Superstorm Sandy :¬† In 2019, the Office filed and settled a civil fraud lawsuit against the City of New York (the ‚ÄúCity‚Äù) alleging that the New York City Department of Transportation (‚ÄúNYCDOT‚Äù) fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by falsely claiming that numerous NYCDOT vehicles were damaged during Superstorm Sandy.¬† Under the settlement, the City agreed to pay $5.3 million. $22.8 Million Settlement of Customs Fraud Lawsuit Against Vitamin Importer for Underpaying Customs Duties Owed on Products Imported Into the United States :¬† In 2023, the Office filed and settled a civil lawsuit against International Vitamins Corporation (‚ÄúIVC‚Äù), a United States-based company that imports and sells vitamins and nutritional supplements from China.¬† The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleged that for years, IVC defrauded the United States by misclassifying more than 30 of its products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in order to avoid paying customs duties, and by failing to pay back duties owed to the United States even after IVC finally corrected its longstanding misclassifications.¬† Under the settlement, IVC agreed to pay $22.8 million.

In September 2023, the Office entered into a consent decree requiring the City of Mount Vernon to spend more than $150 million to upgrade its storm sewer system as required by the Clean Water Act, protecting water quality and addressing the needs of its residents who are living with the unlawful discharge of sewage and illicit pollutants. Other Clean Water Act litigation and settlements can be found here . US v. Stericycle Inc. In January 2025, the Office sued and entered a settlement with Stericycle Inc., a former hazardous waste management firm, for systemic, nationwide violations of the hazardous waste tracking and transportation requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‚ÄúRCRA‚Äù), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 6901 et seq. , between May 5, 2014, through April 6, 2020.¬† Stericycle agreed to pay a $9.5 million civil penalty, one of these largest RCRA civil penalties ever. Other RCRA litigation and settlements can be found here . In June 2022,¬†the Office entered into a settlement with Tzumi Innovations, LLC, for the sale of unregistered antimicrobial products.¬† The settlement required payment of a $1.5 million civil penalty, the largest civil penalty ever obtained in a judicial settlement under the governing statute, and barred Tzumi from future sale or distribution of unregistered antimicrobial products. In the Tronox bankruptcy, after years of litigation and negotiation, the Office entered into a settlement recovering more than $4.4 billion from affiliates of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation for environmental claims and liabilities.¬† This settlement constituted the largest litigation recovery by the United States for the clean-up of environmental contamination. Other Superfund litigation and settlements can be found here . The Office works closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs to pursue violations of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act. Food safety litigation and settlements can be found here . General Defensive Litigation The Office defends the Executive Office of the President, the Cabinet, other government officials, and most federal agencies and departments of the Executive Branch in civil actions challenging the legality of federal policies and programs. ¬†Much of the Civil Division‚Äôs work in this area involves high-profile lawsuits, novel issues of constitutional and administrative law, and important issues of public policy. ¬†This category includes cases brought against federal officials in both their individual and official capacity. Litigation can range from single-plaintiff actions to complex nationwide class actions. ¬†AUSAs handling these cases often must coordinate with the involved federal agencies, as well as with senior leadership within the Department of Justice. In its Constitutional Law practice, the Civil Division defends actions challenging the constitutionality of federal statutes, regulations, or policies, or the actions of individual federal employees. ¬†For example, the Civil Division recently intervened in People of the State of New York v. Arm or Ally, LLC , 22 Civ. 6124, to defend against a Second Amendment challenge to the Gun Control Act and a recent regulation enacted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that makes clear the Act‚Äôs requirements apply to ghost guns. ¬†And Civil Division AUSAs are currently representing the United States Military Academy at West Point in a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the use of race as a factor in admissions, as a violation of Equal Protection ( see Students for Fair Admissions v. United States Military Academy at West Point , 23 Civ. 8262). Many of these cases involve cutting edge First Amendment issues. ¬†The Civil Division is defending President Biden and senior White House officials in Berenson v. Biden , 23 Civ. 3048, alleging that the administration‚Äôs attempts to combat the spread of false information regarding COVID-19 vaccines on social media constituted a violation of the First Amendment. ¬†The Civil Division represented the government in a First Amendment challenge to provisions of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act that required NGOs that received federal funding to adopt a policy against prostitution and sex trafficking ( see Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID , 15-974 (2d Cir.)). And in Stagg, PC v. Department of State , 19-811 (2d Cir.), the Civil Division successfully handled a First Amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting the transfer of technical data required for the manufacture of certain munitions to foreign persons. The Civil Division also defends cases challenging government action or inaction under the Administrative Procedure Act (‚ÄúAPA‚Äù), many of which involve novel legal issues and consequential public interests. ¬†For example, Civil Division AUSAs recently successfully defended an APA action challenging hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for licensed home care service agencies located in New York. And SDNY AUSAs have defended a number of challenges to the authority of Administrative Law Judges on the grounds that they are inferior officers who were not properly appointed in accordance with Article II of the United States Constitution. The Civil Division represents the United States, including its officers and agencies, in employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. ¬†The Division also represents the United States in suits for monetary damages alleging negligent or wrongful acts. ¬†And Civil Division AUSAs represents the VA and other federally funded medical providers in lawsuits alleging malpractice. ¬†These matters, which frequently go to trial, often involve complex fact patterns and require engaging with experts on a wide range of topics. National Security and Foreign Policy The Civil Division is involved in representing the foreign policy interests of the United States: Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , 22 Civ. 5199 (supporting a stay of litigation against Sri Lanka to recover on defaulted sovereign bonds, in order to advance U.S. foreign policy interest in orderly and consensual sovereign debt restructuring); Kunstler v. CIA , 22 Civ. 6913 (alleging that the CIA had unlawfully monitored Julian Assange‚Äôs meetings with third parties while he resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London); Tanvir v. Tanzin , 13 Civ. 6951, 23-738 (2d Cir.) (challenge under the First and Fifth Amendments, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to Plaintiffs‚Äô alleged placement on the No Fly List, which they claimed was due to their refusal to become informants for the FBI). Civil Division AUSAs prepare submissions advising judges on issues related to foreign government immunities: Havlish v. The Taliban , 03 Civ. 9848 (statements of interest in actions brought by victims of the September 11 attack to seize funds of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan‚Äôs central bank held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the Taliban‚Äôs takeover of Afghanistan). Civil Division AUSAs handle matters involving the protection of national security information: In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 , 03 MDL 1570 (successfully asserting state secrets and law enforcement privileges to protect certain classified and otherwise sensitive information sought in discovery); New York Times Co. v. CIA , No. 18-2112 (2d Cir.) (litigation regarding refusal by CIA to confirm or deny whether it possessed records involving covert funding of rebel forces in Syria); American Civil Liberties Union v. CIA , No. 18-2265 (2d Cir.) (request for records cited in the publicly released executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence‚Äôs Committee Study of the CIA‚Äôs Detention and Interrogation Program) ; Osen v. CENTCOM , 19 Civ. 6867 (withholding of photographs depicting improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. military vehicles in Iraq); Open Society Justice Initiative v. Department of State et al. , 19 Civ. 234 (requests for records from multiple members of the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi); Osen v. OFAC , 19 Civ. 405 (challenges to withholding of classified information in memoranda and associated intelligence reports that supported the Office of Foreign Asset Control‚Äôs sanction designations of three charities that were determined to be support nodes for Hamas). Tax and Bankruptcy Civil Division AUSAs represent the interests of the United States in bankruptcy cases filed in the Southern District of New York, including bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies, major pharmaceutical companies (including recently Purdue Pharma and Endo Pharmaceuticals), major domestic and foreign airlines (including American Airlines), car manufacturers (including Chrysler and General Motors), and countless other major companies (including Sears, AIG, and Lehman Brothers).¬† Examples include: In re Purdue Pharma L.P ., No. 23-124 (S. Ct):¬† The Office represents the interests of the United States in the bankruptcy proceeding of Purdue Pharma L.P.¬† Our representation includes advocating on behalf of the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.¬† The Office has also opposed efforts to permit an involuntary third-party release of the Sackler family, who are not debtors in the bankruptcy case, arguing, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Code does not authorize the release of non-debtors from personal liability to other non-debtors. The legality of third-party releases is presently before the Supreme Court. In re Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc . , No. 23 Civ. 2171:¬† In the bankruptcy of a cryptocurrency investment company, the bankruptcy court included a so-called ‚Äúexculpation‚Äù clause in the debtors‚Äô plan, which purported to extinguish (among other things) civil and criminal liability for the debtors‚Äô and various third parties‚Äô future acts.¬† The Office has argued that the Bankruptcy Code does not permit such exculpation and that courts may not involuntarily release the government‚Äôs civil, criminal, and administrative claims. Civil Division AUSAs also handle a variety of complex civil tax cases, including bringing affirmative cases to collect unpaid income and employment taxes and penalties (including FBAR penalties for taxpayers‚Äô failures to report their foreign accounts), litigating tax shelter cases to prevent sophisticated corporate entities from engaging in abusive transactions to shield their income from taxation, and seeking injunctions to put fraudulent tax preparers and tax-shelter promoters out of business.¬† Examples include: New York v. Mnuchin , No. 19-3962 (2d Cir.):¬† In this case the States of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland challenged the constitutionality of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that limited the Internal Revenue Code‚Äôs state and local tax deduction for individuals to $10,000.¬† The Office successfully defended the provision in the district court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.¬† Those courts agreed with our arguments that principles of federalism did not constrain Congress‚Äôs ability to limit this deduction and that the provision at issue did not coerce the states to change their own tax systems. AIG v. United States , No. 09 Civ. 1871:¬† This case involved seven cross-border financial transactions that the United States asserted were abusive tax shelters designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits that AIG improperly attempted to use to reduce its tax liabilities in the United States.¬† The Office asserted that these transactions lacked any meaningful economic substance, were devoid of any legitimate business purpose, and instead were designed solely to manufacture hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits to which AIG was not entitled.¬† ¬† According to the terms of the settlement reached in 2020, AIG agreed that all foreign tax credits that it claimed for the 1997 tax year and all later tax years for these same transactions, totaling more than $400 million, would be disallowed in their entirety.¬† AIG further agreed to pay a 10% tax penalty. United States v. Alvarez , No. 21 Civ. 1930:¬† The Office filed a civil complaint alleging that Rafael Alvarez and his tax-preparation business ATAX New York LLC had prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their clients in which they falsely reduced their clients‚Äô tax liabilities and generated tax refunds to which those clients were not entitled.¬† As part of a settlement in 2021, the defendants admitted that they prepared and filed many federal income tax returns that included claims of expenses, losses, or ‚Äúhead of household‚Äù status that lacked adequate supporting information or documentation, and that these unsupported entries caused the clients‚Äô tax liabilities to be substantially understated.¬† The defendants consented to a permanent injunction that, among other things, prevented them from acting as federal tax return preparers, and they agreed to pay disgorgement. The descriptions of charges set forth above constitute only allegations as to individuals who have not been found guilty, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
