New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District Info Learn about the issues that are important to New Yorkers in your Council District and across the city, from potholes to affordable housing to the immigrant experience and beyond. To assist Council Members and residents in understanding what is important to people in their neighborhood, we have initiated a data driven approach, to serve New Yorkers better. We have brought together a variety of data sources ( 311 , Constituent Services , Census ) to understand what New Yorkers care about and how they live in their neighborhoods and city-wide. This strategy goes hand in hand with the important intuitive and nuanced understanding Council Members and residents have about our neighborhoods, to form a fuller picture of what matters most to residents. 311 Calls and Requests NYC 311 provides access to non-emergency City services and information about City government programs. NYC 311 is available online and by phone.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

Adams Disbursement of a percentage of awards to non-profit organizations for contracts immediately upon registration by the comptroller. Introduction This bill would require the Procurement Policy Board to promulgate rules requiring the immediate disbursement of 80 percent of a fiscal year’s contract funds for agency contracts with non-profit organizations for goods, services or construction upon registration by the Comptroller and upon the start of each subsequent fiscal year, and to establish a process to recover funds for which the agency does not ultimately receive and accept the agreed-upon goods, services or construction.

Introduction This bill would require city agencies to submit annual reports on contract registration during the previous fiscal year. An agency would be required to submit a corrective action plan by January 1 if it: (1) registered 100 or more contracts or contracts valued at over $10 million in the previous fiscal year; and (2) more than 30 percent of its contracts or contract value were registered 90 days or more after their start dates. Such corrective action plans would need to analyze the causes of delays, specify improvements to be made, include implementation timelines, and set performance targets. The city chief procurement officer would be required to submit an annual report to the Mayor and Council analyzing citywide trends in the effectiveness of these corrective action plans.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

Oversight Action details Not available Int 0282-2024 * Julie Menin Accessibility in small businesses. Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

No. 694-A Long-term citywide bathroom strategy and to make other technical changes. Introduction This bill would create a permanent, long-term strategic planning process for establishing and maintaining a citywide public bathroom network. This would be led by a Deputy Mayor in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, and any other agency with relevant experience and expertise. The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The report would recommend a design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with city requirements. The agency would also post a comprehensive online map of all public bathrooms in the City.

Introduction This bill would codify New York City’s (“City” or “NYC”) cooling center program. The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.

The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors.

Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

Together, we will end the carceral system, establish a care economy, and implement a Green New Deal for New York City. Together, we will end the carceral system, establish a care economy, and implement a Green New Deal for New York City. Our Vision Read our comprehensive Public Saftey policy page. What we are really paying police to do is meet protestors with war weapons, to uphold the school to prison pipeline, to help carry out evictions, to be ill-equipped first responders for mental health crises, and to conduct routine traffic stops. The billions of dollars could be redirected to the people and service providers best equipped to deal with those situations, and more important, prevent them from happening in the first place. Yet time and again, we’ve invested in the wrong things, and a lack of imagination and real political courage have stagnated New York City’s progress. As City Council Member, I will commit to divesting from carceral solutions and investing in what actually keeps communities safe and thriving. I will fight for the working people who have built this city. I will push policies that will not only protect New Yorkers now but will create a safer, more livable, city for decades to come. And I will co-govern every day alongside my constituents. To that end, I will work to: End the carceral system in New York City by defunding and disbanding the NYPD, permanently closing Rikers Island, halting the construction of new jails, and embedding restorative practices into all city agencies. During my near-decade of work as a public defender in New York City, I witnessed the trauma our criminal legal system inflicts on Black and brown, poor, and immigrant communities every day. I have long fought for, and remain committed to, a complete transformation of our criminal legal system and an end to policing and mass incarceration. Defund, and ultimately disband, the NYPD and replace it with a community-led public safety infrastructure Fight to close Rikers Island before 2026 and halt the construction of the borough-based jails proposal Create a citywide bail vouchers program to facilitate the release of incarcerated individuals Remove police from schools, traffic enforcement, homeless outreach, and hospitals Invest in the things that keep communities safe by fully funding and desegregating our schools, building new social housing, protecting and expanding opportunities for small businesses, and ending transportation deserts. I am the product of both public and private Queens schooling, a child of parents who grew up in Woodside Houses, and a proud supporter of the district’s diverse small businesses. As we fight to divest from policing and incarceration, we must prioritize investments in the resources and infrastructure that stabilizes individual lives and strengthens communities. Desegregate our schools by advocating for the repeal of Hect-Calandra at the state level, end all discriminatory screens in New York City public schools, and launch a community-led diversity plan for middle schools in Astoria Decommodify housing and support a city-level Homes Guarantee campaign by preserving existing affordable public and social housing (including NYCHA), building new social housing units, and advocating for a comprehensive plan Support small businesses and vendors by fighting for commercial rent control, lifting the cap on street vendor permits, and creating a permanent open street and lot program for business use Fight for increased federal and state funding for the MTA, and transition control over the subways to the city so that capital improvements are made to improve signals, expand service, and guarantee accessibility Establish a caring economy whereby the most vulnerable amongst us have the resources they need to truly thrive and the city’s workforce has dignity, adequate pay, and expanded protections. I am the daughter of both a domestic worker who provided care to neighborhood children and a retired union worker with Otis Elevator Company. I know firsthand how important a strong and robust caregiving infrastructure is to the economic livelihood of our city, and how workplace protections, social benefits, and union membership can lift families out of poverty. Fight for universal access to affordable and quality childcare and eldercare and increase opportunities for training and financial assistance for primary caregivers Expand access to paid family leave under the city’s Earned Safe & Sick Leave Act to independent contractors and gig workers Explore the creation of a citywide portable benefits model to provide social benefits to workers regardless of employment status Implement just cause and whistleblower protections to combat unfair and discriminatory firings, which disproportionately harm Black and brown workers Implement a Green New Deal for New York City by creating green, union jobs, increasing public green spaces, making infrastructure more clean, and ensuring the city’s shorelines are resilient. As Western Queens residents saw during Superstorm Sandy, New York City is particularly vulnerable to the ecological, social, and economic harms of climate change. I recognize the need for solutions as big as the crisis we face, and the importance of using a justice-oriented framework to transform our city and lift up communities most at-risk. Oppose any projects that expand the city’s fossil fuel infrastructure and advocate for the use of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, to achieve a carbon-neutral New York City by 2030 Guarantee healthy living for low-wage workers and communities of color by prioritizing them for new and high-paying clean energy jobs, fighting for publicly-owned power sources, prioritizing waste equity, and investing in urban farming Return streets to pedestrians, cyclists, and communities by creating permanent superblocks, investing in public plazas and greenspaces, and building more protected bike lanes and bus lanes Ensure the city’s shorelines are made more resilient through the creation of hardened, raised architecture and that waterfronts and waterways are publicly accessible and not hoarded by real estate interests Reimagine local government by bringing a proactive, relational organizing framework to constituent services, creating a socialist and leftist bloc to remake the City Council, and prioritizing collaborative design-making and co-governance. In my work as a political organizer, I’ve helped support and elect radical change-agents committed to transforming local government institutions. The New City Council needs a radical shake-up. For the body to truly be the People’s home, we need to remake the institution from the inside-out, bring new life into City Hall, and repair decades of harm. Ensure constituent services is proactive, not reactive, and that district offices are hubs for organizing so that constituents can access the tools, skills, and training needed to find solutions to local problems Organize a socialist and leftist bloc within the City Council to influence not only the Speaker’s race, committee chairs and memberships, but the adoption of session rules and the budget process and outcome Implement internal rules reforms that limit the overwhelming power of the Speaker over the Council’s legislative and budget agenda and pushes the bounds of the body’s power as the effective counterweight to the Mayoralty Use working groups, resident councils and/or neighborhood block groups to influence decision-making, increase understanding of local government processes, and facilitate constant communication and co-governance Our District My platform is rooted in participatory engagement. The above-listed proposals are just a start and if you have recommendations, concerns, or specific proposals, please submit them below. About Tiffany Issues      [email protected]

A New Vision of Public Safety for New York City PDF version of Policy Page What Folks Are Saying "The New York Working Families Party is proud to support Tiffany Caban's visionary policy platform on public safety for the city of New York,” New York Working Families Party State Director Sochie Nnaemeka . “For far too long, New York has relied upon a public safety framework that centers punitive practices--ones that ultimately undermine, not build, community stability. Tiffany's proposals are bold and yet achievable, and will help make New York City a safer and more just place for all of our communities and all of our people." “People are demanding alternatives to using mass criminalization to solve community problems brought on by decades of budget cuts and growing inequality,” said Professor of Sociology and Coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College Alex Vitale . “This document provides a concrete plan for how to do that. It’s going to play a central role in reshaping the conversation about improving public safety and in the process, change the political landscape of New York City.” “To honor the lives of those stolen by police and state sanctioned violence, it is important we take the steps to reckon with racist policing and do the work to redefine public safety,” said New York State Political Director of Citizen Action of New York Stanley Fritz . “Tiffany's plan exemplifies reimagining public safety in a way that centers the voices of those adversely impacted by the justice system—a system that never intended to serve justice for BIPOC and TGNC communities.” “Our fight has never just been about divesting from police and incarceration. It has always been about the critical investments Black and Brown communities need and have been denied. “Police, jails, and prisons will never keep our communities safe,” said VOCAL Action Fund Political Director Paulette Soltani . “Public safety must be reimagined entirely, government must be restructured, and a massive investment of resources must be prioritized to tackle the intersecting issues of poverty, homelessness, mental health, and drug use. New York City must build a public health and social services workforce to ensure housing, services, and care for all." Summary New York City must modernize our vision of public safety to fit the needs of the new century. Rather than spending billions on policing and incarceration, we should create and scale citywide, neighborhood-level, community-led safety initiatives. Ending our reliance on police is only a part of the solution – the bigger piece is properly funding the social services and basics people need for stability. Fully funding public safety means fully funding services that generate neighborhood stability and establishing a comprehensive and scaled-up non-policing emergency and crisis response apparatus instead of funding policing. It also means giving people in the community adequate resources and support to solve community-level problems. This program calls for the development of neighborhood-level interventions that can be tailored to the needs of each of our city’s 51 City council districts. It includes proposals for: (1) Community Safety Centers, which will include family support, violence prevention, and mediation services; racism and hate response funds; and Crisis Intervention Teams; (2) Integrated Service Facilities with on-site safe consumption services, treatment programs, peer support, legal and case management support for housing, healthcare, immigration, and jobs; as well as support systems for people experiencing homelessness, including transitory housing, programs for safe respite, mail drops, showers, and referrals; (3) Enhanced counseling and health services, wraparound services, and restorative programming at every school, instead of police; (4) Non-police systems for responding to transportation or traffic-related issues; (5) Comprehensive mental health and crisis response services, including community-based treatment programs and a non-police 911 health care responder corps; (6) A Civil Life Corps that handles quality-of-life related matters and day-to-day issues that require resolution but do not warrant involving law enforcement, including a civilian Property Protection team that can provide advice on crime prevention, take official insurance reports, and authorize compensation for losses. The paper includes examples of how these programs would be used, some of the community organizations who have already started doing this work, and names some of the agencies involved – though the plan will require new agencies and initiatives as well. We hope that this effort facilitates defunding the NYPD and eliminating the roles that the NYPD and incarceration play in New York City’s public safety. We highlight some of the community groups that could be scaled up as an alternative to policing, by defunding police and corrections and through downstream savings. Rather than evaluating the problems with specific units or budgetary avenues toward defunding policing and prisons, which will be explored in a separate paper, our goal is to promote conversations on public health approaches to public safety, and create the environment necessary for a world without policing. Introduction New York City must fully fund public safety by investing in the things that create stability. This paper outlines a plan to center community voices, put people to work in their own neighborhoods, and uplift neighborhood-based initiatives that evidence shows will create more public safety than police and prisons ever could. Our campaign will engage in community discussions that facilitate coalition-building and help create a new City Council committed to the new vision of public safety our city deserves. We need solutions scaled to the size of the problem that is the policing-prison-industrial complex and mass incarceration. We need to fully fund public safety by fully funding our most impacted communities. Police are tasked with responding to problems that they are ill-equipped to handle. That includes public health issues related to poverty, mental illness, substance use, sex work, domestic and sexual violence, youth violence, and more. Cities committed to long-term stability should listen to communities and activists, defund police and spend that money on communities and public health alternatives instead. This alternative system of investments would prioritize and scale public health approaches based on evidence, including non-police emergency healthcare responders, community-based-and-led safety initiatives, restorative justice programming, investments in liberation focused support personnel, violence prevention, and legal services that address housing, healthcare, immigration, disability justice and accessibility, employment, or indigenous community-specific needs, and other everyday issues. These kinds of investments would dramatically reduce the root drivers of problems the system currently defines as criminal behavior. The modern American policing-prison complex has always been a system of social control designed to facilitate race and class exploitation. Slave patrols evolved through Jim Crow and broken-windows into the militarized police force we have today, and the overcriminalization of a range of social issues has caused the mass incarceration of disproportionately Black and brown people. There are 2.3 million people incarcerated in America; nearly half of the people incarcerated in New York state prisons are from New York City. More than 250,000 people are incarcerated in New York jails and prisons every year, including thousands who are being held in pre-trial detention merely because they cannot afford money bail. We spend about $10 billion every year on policing in New York City – the 33rd largest military budget on the planet. That’s roughly $200 million per council district, each of which include about 160,000 people. What do we get for that investment? New York City is overpoliced and over-incarcerated, and its elected leaders have systematically disinvested from communities historically oppressed by racist policies. Hundreds of people in our city have died due to police-involved activity just this past decade. Nationwide, there have been 5,000 police-involved killings since 2015, half of which involve someone with disability or mental illness. Police disproportionately make arrests in poorer, non-white communities by criminalizing poverty, mental illness, substance use, and sex work. Prosecutors and courts then apply brutally harsh sentencing schemes, putting people in jails and prisons that exacerbate violence and do not help people through crises or prevent future crime. For generations, this nation has refused to invest in the things that really keep people safe: housing, health care, job opportunities, community-led safety initiatives, and public health solutions to public health problems. Fully funding those programs is a better way to fully fund public safety. Police do not solve most crimes and do nearly nothing to help survivors and victims. Rates of legal accountability for serious crimes hovers just above 10% based on the little data police make available, and most people who commit murders and rapes are not held accountable. Moreover, because police can manipulate data and even institute racist arrest quotas, clearance rates themselves seriously overestimate the actual rate at which people are held accountable when a crime is committed. If someone is in a situation where they need to call 911 because they are afraid for their life, police are unlikely to be able to help. The last thing survivors need is the perpetuation of harm that policing and prisons inflict; rather, most survivors and victims want services tailored to their needs. What do we need to do as a society to prevent as many bad outcomes and reduce as much harm as possible? The answer is investing in services and resources that prevent bad outcomes from happening. People who have access to opportunity, who grow up in a stable environment, and who feel confident that their future is secure almost never commit a serious violent crime like murder. Tragedies will still occur, unfortunately, and society must hold people accountable when harm is done. But the system that exists today does not prevent or resolve these tragedies, and the system’s cost – the generational destruction of disproportionately poorer Black and brown neighborhoods – means the solution of policing and prisons is worse than the problem it is trying to address. Our city has spent too many billions of dollars on an agency that uses gas on the people who live here, runs us over with cars, evicts us from our homes, tells us who qualifies as a journalist and who doesn’t, separates us from our families, deports us, rapes us, kills us – with no accountability. The solution to the problems of our time is not spending more money on racist, classist tools of oppression and violence. Here are some of the community-led efforts that we could spend that money on instead. Community Safety Centers Despite massive spending on policing and jails, people do not feel safe. People living in New York City continue to experience domestic violence, youth violence, gun violence, and police violence. This section outlines Community Safety Centers, one-stop shops for community-led alternatives to criminalization that focus on violence interruption, restorative justice and services-based approaches, expanding on existing City programs like the Crisis Management System and community neighborhood-based approaches. Every neighborhood could have a non-police, community-based center for comprehensive crisis intervention, mediation, supportive services, and violence prevention. In addition, police fail to respond to trafficking and instead criminalize sex workers in a way that prevents accountability for actual traffickers. Sex work is work and must be fully decriminalized; the government should have no place in the bedroom of consenting adults. Where people are concerned about harm to sex workers or orderliness, Family Support services could send teams capable of providing support for runaway and vulnerable youth, income supports for women in vulnerable positions, as well as trauma services for those surviving childhood sexual abuse. We need to invest in comprehensive family support programs, peer support, youth violence intervention programs, youth job programs, credible messenger systems involving violence disruption by trained experts including people recently released from incarceration, community mediation, community violence centers able to meet the needs of 160,000 people in a Council District, and fully funded community-based crisis intervention teams that can prevent violence and de-escalate situations. Wherever possible these supports will be provided by trained and compensated members of the community who are closest to the problem. These services will be non-coercive – they will be offered to people, rather than required of people. Family Supports Community Safety Centers would include Family Support services that work with and in households to improve parent and child education, provide counseling, address gender violence with support and services, pursue disability justice and offer education and services, and help disadvantaged families or young people. Studies show that families who receive family-centered support are satisfied with the care they receive, and that such care can reduce incidents of child abuse or neglect in families by 29% or more. Establishing family support centers in every neighborhood would ensure families can have access to healthcare information about their children, treatment from vaccinations to mental healthcare, peer support, counseling, legal aid, gender violence support, wraparound services, income supports, and intensive therapy as needed to help keep families together and reduce conflict. New York has started these kinds of programs. But as happens all too often in our service provision sector, employee turnover has been high due to better salaries elsewhere. We must pay a staff of social service and care providers good salaries with benefits and socially prioritize funding for these programs, and ensure social service providers have the right to organize without retaliation. Despite ongoing fiscal challenges, the NYC programs have demonstrated significant success worth scaling: they can reduce child displacement from homes, and they can help families better prevent future incidents. Example of Use: A parent is struggling with alcohol dependency and the family has experienced trauma. The family can come to the Community Safety Center for Family Support services. The parent can get medical care, individualized counseling, and parenting skills classes, while the center provides childcare and individualized support to help the child develop healthy coping mechanisms. All family members can access these services, and medical staff on-site will be available to answer urgent support questions 24/7. Example of Use: A community member who recognizes a sex worker who seems to be underaged, or suffering from some physical or emotional harm is able to refer them to Family Support, who can support them through trauma services, housing, and healthcare services. Example of Use: A person experiences intimate partner violence. They can come to Family Support for holistic services, counseling and access to legal support. If their immigration status depends on their partner, they can get an immigration attorney. If they have a child, the child can receive individualized care and tools to cope with the trauma.

Violence Prevention Services Young people are developing and vulnerable to trauma. This biology is mostly lost on the criminal legal system. Behaviorally, our brains develop through the age of 25 – yet police activity disproportionately involves going after young people. Young people who are acting out, exhibiting violent or antisocial behavior do not need police. We must provide these young people with holistic wraparound services, and facilitate credible messaging programs like LIFE Camp, Cure Violence, and others that focus on public health approaches to youth violence and gender violence prevention. These initiatives work with young people by hiring people who are in the community and familiar with its intricacies and conflicts to develop individualized strategies that address young people’s needs, and the evidence shows they work – these kinds of programs can reduce shootings or killings by 70%. Violence interrupter presence consistently leads to reduced violence and reduced police involvement. Example of Use: A young person is involved in an altercation with another young person. People in the area, friends and family worry the conflict will escalate into violence. Credible messengers from the community who have similar experiences and are engaged in long-term relationship building intervene. They work to establish processes and coping mechanisms that allow the young people to heal and to break cycles of violence. They help train the young people in de-escalation techniques, equipping them with tools to cool off. Example of Use: Two young people get into a dispute at school. Violence interrupters respond to the school premises. The team goes in, and, if necessary, physically separates the two young people. The peer interrupters talk to the young people and help equip them with the tools to resolve the conflict. No escalation. No retaliation.

Community Mediation Centers Police are often tasked with responding to non-criminal neighborhood-level conflicts, and it is a matter of luck whether the responding officer is both familiar with the people involved or their backgrounds and trusted enough to help de-escalate a conflict. Community-based mediation would enable trusted community members to resolve conflicts. Evidence on community mediation centers shows that they lead to broader satisfaction than policing and prisons, and generate buy-in from community members. Neighborhoods that can mediate their own conflicts tend to engender their own stability, which is a recipe for longer-term success. If members of a community are involved in a dispute over property, noise complaints, inappropriate conduct or some other hyper-local matter, other members of that community will be better equipped with the knowledge and understanding to resolve the conflict, particularly if we work with them on training and outreach so that every person knows where and how to resolve a conflict without involving law enforcement. Example of Use: A bodega owner and group of teenagers are getting into weekly disputes about noise disturbances and roughhousing. A team from the Community Mediation Center would respond to the situation and engage the teenagers and bodega owner in a mediation process using a restorative approach that facilitates space for the young people to express themselves and develop tools of resilience while meeting the bodega owner’s need for a calm and safe environment. Agencies Involved HRA, MOCJ Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Common Justice, and others. Violence Mediation Centers and Community-based Alternatives to Incarceration In the event violence occurs in the community, police are used as a blunt instrument – in other words, they perpetuate violence against the people involved. Rather than address instances of violence with policing and prisons, we could work with programs like Common Justice and others, proven to work and developed right here in New York City, showing the way on non-carceral alternatives to instances of violence. We could establish centers that can meet the needs of the 160,000 people in each Council District. If there is an act of violence, the approach would aim to center restorative responses that bring impacted people together and center their needs. That will mean different forms of accountability than the carceral response; it will mean prioritizing helping survivors and victims as much as possible, working with survivors and victims of gender violence to address their needs and trauma, identifying the root causes that led to an incident and working to address it, providing clear and swift accountability that focuses on trying to make the community whole rather than throwing someone in a cage, and engaging in long-term holistic dialogue aimed at lasting resolution, if and when appropriate. Communities will be empowered to develop individualized strategies to help heal wounds of violence rather than being forced to rely on policing and prisons as the only recourse. Agencies Involved HRA, MOCJ Example of Community Organization Doing This Work Common Justice, and others. Racism, Hate and Violence Response Funds When a community goes through its worst days – enduring an act of racism, hate or violence, including gender violence – the primary response available to them is policing. But police perpetuate systemic racism and violence, including in responding to cases of racism and violence. Two wrongs do not make a right. Police are also often perpetuators of racist or hate-based violence. Instead of addressing racism, hate or violence with more of the same, we could establish funds that allow people who have experienced an act of racism or violence to receive compensation. These funds would also allow people experiencing gender, youth or any type of violence to receive emergency funds, without police involvement. Emergency relief could help people get through difficult crisis situations, and the person could connect with additional Community Safety Center and Integrated Service Facility resources to access emergency housing counseling, peer support and other services they may need. In conjunction with other programming aimed at restoring and helping people through services and support, compensation for acts of racism or violence can provide people with assurance that their trauma will not compound into further trauma based on new financial difficulty. And in a very real sense, receiving compensation for such an act can help provide closure and a sense of justice without the tremendous deleterious baggage of the policing-prison system. These Funds would also work to engage in a restorative justice process for offenders, and publish a report on the incident to reckon with and begin a reconciliation process. The system would provide victims with support needed to get through the crisis. Racist actions have systemic, racist roots. They are a product of our racist society and we have a collective responsibility to repair that damage. Example of Use: A Black person who is bird-watching is subjected to racist insults and a police call, infringing their civil liberties and dignity. The person can turn to the New York Racism and Hate Response Fund and receive financial compensation for the emotional harm and life disruption. Example of Use: A Muslim woman is accosted by someone for wearing a hijab at a local market. She could apply for financial compensation from the New York Racism and Hate Response Fund for any harm or trauma imposed by the event. Example of Use: A mother who experiences abuse by the father of her children needs support but does not want him incarcerated. She could work with the appropriate support programs and apply for the New York Violence Response Fund and receive financial compensation. Example of Use: An indigenous community has been denied relief for property theft. The community could seek a reconciliation and relief process through the New York Racism and Hate Response Fund, regardless of when the theft occurred, to engage in restorative approaches that seek to recognize harms done and work with the community to identify and pursue pathways to relief.

Non-Police Crisis Intervention Teams When people are experiencing a crisis such as incidences of domestic, gender or youth violence, police are tasked with responding and addressing the situation. Too often, that response results in use of deadly force – but even when it does not, it can escalate the situation rather than resolve it. Civilian Crisis Intervention Teams (CITs) composed of violence reduction-focused de-escalation and behavioral health experts are better equipped than police to respond to these situations. Expanding crisis intervention programs and training, including for existing programs like Intensive Mobile Treatment teams (IMTs), can help mitigate local problems without involving police by enabling trusted community members and experts to join and spend extensive time learning about crisis intervention. These teams could help respond to a case of domestic, sexual, community-based, or youth violence. The groups could work as violence interrupters, linked to social workers that help people who are in crisis. Members of the CIT would regularly interact with people in the community and people who come to the Community Safety Center, so that their arrival on a scene includes someone who is known to people involved in the incident. Trained experts on sexual, domestic or youth violence mitigation are more likely to be able to successfully intervene and resolve or mitigate these kinds of crises. Example of Use: Two people in a long-term relationship are experiencing hardship, and one partner begins emotionally and physically abusing the other. CITs who are from the community and know both people respond to the situation, physically separate the pair if necessary, and engage them in a restorative process that centers the needs of both and ensures the person abused has resources, services and tools in place to feel safe and stable. They are connected to Family Support and other appropriate services for longer-term treatment.

Integrated Service Facilities Our city could establish Integrated Service Facilities citywide that provide comprehensive substance use treatment, overdose prevention services, and legal support for housing, employment, or other issues that arise. Deeply affordable, sustainable housing is fundamental to stable neighborhoods. Rise of crime is highly connected to economic hardships including struggles to pay for rent or utilities. Our city has wasted money trying to incentivize affordable housing through private development for too long. In order to solve our housing crisis, we need to renovate and develop green, mixed income housing that every person can afford. We must eliminate homelessness in our city by providing a home to every person experiencing homelessness. We must create and scale mitigation programs that provide people with a place for safe respite, mail drops, showers, and access to housing support services. Housing Support Services Housing precarity and homelessness are citywide crises. Right now, police are tasked with carrying out evictions and with responding to people experiencing homelessness, and the interactions frequently result in violence – whether it is removal or physical harm. Police disproportionately hurt or kill people who are experiencing homelessness, and should be removed entirely from responding to situations involving people experiencing homelessness and other housing issues. Services facilities would include support for housing – transitory housing, arrears payment funds to keep people in homes, support to ensure people are shifted into the shelter system, legal services for residents experiencing problems with rent or their mortgage, and a centralized location for people to turn to when they go through displacement or housing problems. That will include beds, 24/7 support staff, and a direct line available through 911 operators when a housing issue arises, including options to help transport people and their belongings to a safe space. Example of Use: A young person is kicked out of his home. They can immediately reach out to an emergency operator who will connect them to the local Integrated Service Facility and engage Housing Support to come pick them and their belongings up, provide them with a temporary safe space to sleep, and help them secure relevant legal counsel and support services. Example of Use: An older couple is experiencing financial hardship and is no longer able to pay their mortgage. Their lender is threatening to take their home. They can contact Housing Support to connect with emergency rent and mortgage relief, as well as legal counsel and financial planning advisers to help chart a course through their housing precarity.

Safe Respite Homelessness Mitigation Programs Police sweeping camps of people experiencing homelessness and making arrests does not solve the root issue, and makes the situation worse for the people involved. It also costs a tremendous amount of money to incarcerate people in jails or prisons. People who are in between housing need mitigation programs and access to a safe space for respite, including mail drops, showers, laundry and access to basics. Ensuring guaranteed access to these kinds of services will mean every person has a place they know they can go to take care of daily needs. Outreach programs can connect trained experts with people experiencing homelessness to increase access to housing opportunities and transitory support systems. Example of Use: A person is experiencing homelessness. They have a job interview coming up. They can come to the Safe Respite mitigation center to shower, clean their clothes, drop off and receive mail, rest for a short period of time and prepare for the job interview. Agencies Involved Department of Homeless Services (DHS) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, Coalition for the Homeless Substance Use Treatment Programs People with substance use disorder are frequent targets of policing and end up incarcerated, even though incarceration often exacerbates problems related to substance use. Relapse itself is particularly dangerous after incarceration – people who are reentering are particularly vulnerable to returning to drug use and to overdosing. Police and prisons do not address or improve problems stemming from substance use disorder. Substance use treatment programs can. Ensuring every neighborhood has access to comprehensive substance use care can help turn the tide of the opioid epidemic and the broader issues with substance use challenging our society. Treatment programs with inpatient and outpatient capacity can equip people with tools to cope with substance use issues, facilitate recovery, provide peer support, and ensure quality healthcare at every point of the recovery process. These kinds of programs may require years of proactive engagement with people to ensure long-term stability, because recovery is a lifelong process. Service facility treatment programs would be capable of engaged long-term care. We must also look at the underlying forces that drive harmful substance use. Long term unemployment, untreated mental health problems, unaddressed childhood traumas all play a role and could be addressed through better access to stable incomes, high quality mental health services, and trauma counseling. Example of Use: A person is struggling with opioid dependency. In the course of the pandemic, they have used opioids multiple times after years of sobriety. They recognize they need help, and engage with loved ones to reach out to the Substance Use Treatment Program to receive counseling, treatment, and inpatient treatment followed by outpatient care.

Overdose Prevention and Safe Consumption Services Safe consumption services are a core component of saving lives in the midst of the opioid epidemic and its effect on HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Safe consumption services are particularly important during public health crises including a pandemic. Overdose prevention services including supervised consumption sites and the accompanying treatment programs have demonstrated substantial success wherever they are implemented. These facilities prevent overdose deaths on-site, and reduce county-wide overdose death rates by about 30%. This kind of intervention is a core aspect of reducing the tens of thousands of overdose deaths nationwide and the thousands of deaths in New York City. In addition to the moral imperative, there is strong fiscal sense in establishing safe consumption services. Overdose prevention sites cost roughly $2 million per site, and studies show they save some $6 million per site in downstream healthcare costs. These sites are medical facilities that could be created in order to cope with an ongoing epidemic, providing preventative measures from narcan to clean needles to condoms. We could build on existing local efforts and establish these facilities as quickly as possible. Example of Use: A person purchases intravenous drugs, but is worried about impurities that could lead to overdose death, and does not have access to a clean needle. They can go to a Safe Consumption Services facility for a clean needle, as well as have the drug tested for purity to eliminate the risk of overdose and other health related complications. They can use at the facility, and in the event they do experience health complications, on-site medical personnel can apply life-saving treatment like Narcan. When the person leaves the facility, they take Narcan and other treatment information with them to share with their community.

Legal Support Clinics People who are experiencing everyday problems related to immigration, housing, employment, sexual or domestic violence, child care, elder care, retirement help, estate planning or other basic needs frequently have nowhere to turn to for quality, free and tailored advice. Comprehensive, quality and free Legal Support Clinics would be available at Integrated Service Facilities, including for these problems and more. Quality and comprehensive legal care should be guaranteed, similar to healthcare and housing; Legal Support Clinics will be fully staffed with attorneys, and will partner with independent and private legal service providers. Police responding to issues stemming from lack of adequate legal support often make the legal position of people involved worse. In the same way our city should provide fully funded public defense to every person charged with a crime, it should also provide fully funded civil legal support services to every person who needs help addressing problems that arise from everyday life. Example of Use: ICE arrests and is seeking to deport a family member. The person can turn to a Legal Support Clinic for comprehensive, free immigration representation. The family can receive additional legal support for problems that arise related to housing or employment. Example of Use: A person experiencing workplace harassment is afraid of employer retaliation for pursuing a complaint. They could turn to a Legal Support Clinic for legal services and representation that protects them against retaliation. Example of Use: A person with a disability requests installation of an accessible entryway at their apartment building. The landlord does not promptly comply. The person can come to a Legal Support Clinic to get legal help to compel installation if necessary, and referral to Civil Engineer Corps services for short-term relief.

School-Based Support Instead of Policing We need school counselors, not cops. School Safety Agents (SSAs) do not help our students’ education, and they do not even make young people safer – if anything, the presence of SSAs leads to the increased likelihood of arrest or upcharging minor problems into serious legal issues, and research shows Black students are monitored more closely and punished more frequently than white students, beginning at pre-school. SSAs and invasive security measures including metal detectors should be entirely removed from schools, and the School Safety Division should be disbanded. Instead, our city should spend that money on individualized, targeted strategic resource investment in students and teachers, including social, emotional and mental health support staff for students and families, that can help ensure every young person has the opportunity to succeed. Guaranteeing young people have access to counselors and supportive services both increases their chances of success and keeps our communities healthier and safer. Restorative programs and wraparound services address problems in student’s lives without subjecting them to school discipline or juvenile detention proceedings that only make things worse. Counselors and Medical Staff Funding School Safety Agents are police in schools that are supposed to promote student safety but in practice end up over-policing disproportionately Black and brown students. Although young people do not misbehave at different rates based on race, the presence of police in schools means a Black student is 2.3 times more likely to be arrested for an incident than a white student. In our school system, which is among the most segregated public systems in the nation, this kind of disparity means some schools have police who send young people to jail, while others do not – for the same conduct. Evidence shows that students who have experienced trauma or emotional distress frequently do not have access to counseling services. Yet lack of adequate funding for school healthcare staff during the pandemic means cops are helping take students’ temperatures. Schools should be centers for learning. Students need counselors and nurses to receive comprehensive emotional and physical healthcare. Every school should be equipped with a staff of trained healthcare experts who can provide students with whatever treatment they need or identify appropriate follow-up for care outside of school. We should replace school police with counselors, nurses, and medical staff that can ensure our children can receive the care that they need to learn effectively. Example of Use: A group of students has escalating interpersonal relationship problems at school. One-on-one consultations reveal they are experiencing various issues driving their conflict. A team of school counselors work with the students to teach them how to build healthy relationships with one another, understand how and why the conflicts arose, and develop tools together on acceptable ways to identify and resolve conflict. Where appropriate, family members are engaged for Wraparound Services. Agencies Involved DOE Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work The Door, NAMI-NYC, Community Access, Dignity in Schools, and others. Individualized Targeted Strategies Schools that spend money on policing should instead invest in individualized targeted strategies for students. Evidence shows that these kinds of strategies can increase graduation rates dramatically, and facilitate future education and employment opportunities. Targeted supportive services including mental health specialists, learning and physical disability specialists, gender and youth violence prevention experts, trauma experts, and additional support systems are better equipped to help young people learn and succeed than police. Supporting students in this way will not only better address crises as they unfold, they can prevent crises from happening in the first place and can ensure students are on the path to self-sustaining and socially beneficial lives. Example of Use: A social worker identifies a student who is experiencing mental health difficulties that result in disruptive behavior in the classroom. The social worker works with the student to address the root issues in an individualized setting. The worker consults with a team including counselors, teachers and other experts to develop a holistic plan that addresses the student’s needs, and engages in a long-term effort to help resolve them.

Youth Restorative Justice Programs Violence prevention has to start early. When police intervene, conflicts are escalated and can result in discipline or even arrest. Effective violence prevention and restorative justice programming should be available at all points of the day. Restorative programs can resolve conflicts rather than imposing violence to force them to stop. Restorative justice programs and mediation experts can de-escalate conflict and facilitate resolution through dialogue. These kinds of interventions are longer-lasting and equip students with tools to cope with future situations. Addressing the root problems leading to violent incidents with support and restorative approaches will facilitate broader social change in how we approach violence, and develop systems for intervening at developmental stages that are historically most closely associated with violent or antisocial behavior currently addressed through policing, detention and incarceration. Example of Use: Two students have an altercation that ends in a fistfight. A team of restorative justice experts works with the students to talk about the circumstances leading to the conflict, the issues in their lives that need addressing, and when appropriate a consensual dialogue that aims to resolve the conflict and equip the students with language and processes to de-escalate future conflicts. Agencies Involved MOCJ, Department of Youth & Community Development (DYCD) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Restorative Justice Initiative, El Puente, Girls for Gender Equity, VOCAL, Brooklyn Restorative Justice Project, and others. Wraparound Services Students exhibiting behavioral problems often receive escalating discipline and, when police are involved, may eventually become entangled with the criminal legal system. This response exacerbates crises and creates new ones. Just as police are incapable of resolving long-term mental health problems, police cannot resolve the multiple forms of trauma young people can experience. Every school should be equipped to provide wraparound services. That means schools need staff with family support experts who can engage teams including family members to help students overcome problems impacting their ability to learn. Incorporating family and loved ones into the support process is critical to ensuring long-term success, and can help equip family members with tools to support students in their home environment. Example of Use: Students in an altercation receiving individualized strategies identify family problems as a source of their in-school issues. Wraparound Services engages families and loved ones with holistic long-term counseling and skills training to address out-of-school issues that arise and lead to or exacerbate student conflict.

Non-Police Traffic Safety Evidence shows police do not contribute to traffic safety. Police should be removed from traffic-related enforcement. Traffic violations can be handled by civilian teams, non-biased automated systems and concerted education-based outreach. Where necessary, teams of non-police unarmed responders can assist in emergency situations. Transportation safety must include comprehensive investment in street infrastructure, free public transportation and urban planning that makes our streets safer, including bike lanes and safe open spaces for pedestrians. Non-Police Traffic Responders Police involvement in traffic response is one of the most dangerous areas of civilian-police interactions. People have been killed for reaching for their driver’s license, arguing their innocence, or simply being in a car with a panicking police officer nearby or as a result of a high speed chase. About 11% of police-involved killings in 2015 occurred during traffic enforcement, with disproportionately Black victims. Writing tickets is not worth lives, and there are better ways to enforce traffic safety rules. Non-police traffic responders, including a Department of Transportation Collision Investigation Squad, could operate in teams to respond to emergency situations on the road, and call in additional support in the event of medical situations. Removing police from these situations would eliminate a high-risk area of police-civilian interaction. Traffic responder teams of experts trained in de-escalation, auto mechanics and first aid provision are better options for roadway emergencies. Example of Use: A reckless driver causes a collision. A Collision Investigation Squad would examine the circumstances and causes of the collision, and compare it to automated system and city-wide data. A team of experts would work with the drivers involved to address the root causes behind the collision, provide the drivers with services to get through the trauma, and sustain outreach to prevent future collisions. Agencies Involved Department of Transportation (DOT) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Transportation Alternatives, Families for Safe Streets, and others. Driver Safety Education and Outreach Police react to driver incidents but do not prevent future incidents from occurring – the key to prevention is teams of civilian responders trained in de-escalation coupled with outreach and education. When a person demonstrates they are incapable of obeying the rules of the road, they should be held accountable and prohibited from driving but not prevented from earning a livelihood – we need alternative transportation mechanisms in place sufficient to ensure people can get where they need to go without driving. The Outreach program could work with people with suspended licenses to ensure problems are not compounded. And it could engage in long-term, relationship-based educational programming that works with individual drivers to achieve sustainable change and safe approaches to road travel. Example of Use: A new driver operates their vehicle recklessly on their way to work and endangers a pedestrian, and their license is suspended as a result. They are now at risk of losing their job. The Driver Safety Education and Outreach program would engage in a long-term process that works with the new driver to teach safe vehicle operation practices, and provide the driver with alternative modes of transportation to work until safe conduct is demonstrated. Agencies Involved DOT Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Transportation Alternatives, Street Vendor Project, Families for Safe Streets, and others. Automated Traffic Safety Systems Police often work to meet traffic-related citation quotas as a mechanism of funding, and frequently use pretexts in traffic stops such as the smell of cannabis to disproportionately harm Black and brown people. Police were never supposed to control public transit safety. Their jurisdiction in this space has perpetuated systemic harms, and this harm is untenable. Minor speeding or other traffic violations can result in dangerous police-civilian interactions. Establishing automated systems with a progressive sliding scale for citations for traffic violations in conjunction with civilian responders increases traffic safety, but only when such systems do not act as a new tax on Black, Latinx or poor communities. Ensuring these systems do not perpetuate invidious racial bias is critical to their success. Automated systems must not be utilized where they risk such bias. Additionally, these systems must not act to expand the surveillance state or include any kind of facial recognition or other privacy-invading technologies. Example of Use: A driver is speeding in a high-risk area. Warning signs indicate the presence of automated cameras. The system captures the driver speeding, and the driver is issued a citation. If necessary, the Outreach Team connects with the driver to develop long-term safe-driving practices. Agencies Involved DOT Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Families for Safe Streets, Transportation Alternatives, and others. Data-Driven Traffic Policy Major metropolitan areas like New York City should rely on data-driven approaches to reduce traffic-related incidents. Rather than reactively conducting vehicle pursuits or driver stops, the city should examine patterns of incidents and address the root problems that lead to them. Implementing evidence-based, data-driven reforms across city agencies could reduce both city driver and citizen driver traffic incidents. We need a paradigm shift around the relationship between our streets, cars, cyclists and pedestrians. The city needs to expand its bike lanes and establish safe open spaces for pedestrians. Public transportation should work with community groups to ensure best practices are followed. Accountability for conduct is critical; that response cannot be led by policing and incarceration – research shows it is counterproductive. Example of Use: All city agencies with drivers implement Vision Zero training to reduce city-involved crashes. A city driver gets into an accident. The driver receives training and education to address any issues behind the accident. The driver has the opportunity to demonstrate safe conduct and follow an accountability plan including restorative approaches to engaging with the survivor or victim. The survivor or victim receives support and services to get through their trauma and crisis. Example of Use: City agencies investigate a busy intersection where crashes occur. The agencies develop and implement a plan that prioritizes pedestrian and biker safety over driver convenience, involving adding bus lanes, barriered bike lanes and pedestrian guides. Agencies Involved Transportation Alternatives, Families for Safe Streets, and others. Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Families for Safe Streets, Transportation Alternatives, and others. Mental Health Services and Responders Jails and prisons should not be the largest provider of mental health treatment in our state. We need to create and scale non-police emergency healthcare responders for health-related problems. We need to establish community-based services that improve responses to individuals in mental health crises by ensuring they have access to treatment, emotional support, and expert care. Community Mental Health Centers In the 20th century, when the federal government reduced funding for state mental health institutes, it suggested communities would take on the task. Instead, the reality in 2020 is that people living with mental illness and the families trying to support them frequently have no place to turn. Every community could have an established Community Mental Health Center that is capable of meeting people’s needs where they are and addressing these situations before they get worse. These centers would include proactive outreach and service provision centered on long-term individualized outpatient support with crisis inpatient capacity. Families need a place they know they can get help caring for loved ones. Community-based mental healthcare centers could ensure people do not have to travel a great distance to receive quality mental healthcare. Too often, we see tragedies despite a litany of red flags – we must invest in the kind of preventative models and long-term support systems that can avert harm. This can start with scaled-up peer-based counseling, which Los Angeles County is doing and like New York City has begun implementing. Example of Use: A family member concerned about the mental health of a loved one in their care goes with them to their local mental health center where they receive a diagnosis and a treatment plan. The family member is given advice on how to support their loved one and contacts for follow-up care. Example of Use: A community member who would like mental health support but has no current medical support is paired with a peer counselor who is trained to counsel outside of a crisis situation and can identify someone in crisis and direct them to more supportive care. Agencies Involved DOHMH Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Community Counseling and Mediation, Institute for Family Health: Center for Counseling, and others. Healthcare Responder Corps Police are tasked with responding to situations involving people going through mental crises. About 25% of people who are living with mental illness have reported contact with police, and the result is too often deadly – half of all police killings involve a person suffering from mental illness. Tasking police with responding to mental health problems guarantees deadly outcomes. And in situations involving someone with substance use disorder, police frequently use intoxication as an excuse for use of deadly force. We need to establish an alternative – a non-police responder corps that includes de-escalation experts, gender violence experts, healthcare providers and peer support for healthcare-related situations, as community advocates and elected leaders have called for in New York and across the country. In Oregon, the CAHOOTS model has shown responding to substance use with healthcare reduces subsequent issues and establishes treatment pathways that better facilitate long-term recovery than a police response. The CAHOOTS program successfully diverts 20% of all 911 calls and in the process saves local governments millions of dollars. Denver, Austin, Los Angeles and other cities are implementing similar models at the local level. And in New York City, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams has called for a comprehensive 911 healthcare option that can address behavioral health issues with behavioral health responders, substance use issues with experts on addiction, and the multiple healthcare problems that can arise with appropriate responders including peer specialists and a direct line to non-police health experts in situations involving someone considering self-harm. This Corps would be fully staffed and equipped to handle both emergency 911 situations and daily non-emergency problems – including an alternative hotline for people in varying kinds of emotional distress who need someone to talk to. Example of Use: A concerned family member calls 911 when a person with a history of mental illness threatens self-harm. This call is diverted to a non-police emergency responder who is an expert in de-escalating mental health crises. They work with the patient and concerned family members to develop an ongoing care plan and ensure support is put into place to prevent future crises before they happen. Example of Use: Someone calls 911 when they witness a member of their household overdosing. An ambulance is called, and they are paired with a behavioral health responder who can determine options for immediate intervention as well as help them develop a long-term harm reduction plan. Example of Use: A person is worried that they are experiencing problems related to mental health. The situation is not an emergency, but the person needs help. The Healthcare Responder Corps could respond, establish an initial relationship, and help the person access services they need.

Civil Life Corps Historically, police have responded violently to situations that hold our democracy or institutions to account or demand more from our government. Our democracy is an organic, living process – responding to demonstrations or complaints about quality of life with a violent process only exacerbates the issue. Our city could expand and establish comprehensive programming that addresses the multiple and complicated needs of our civil society to ensure that every person’s rights are proactively protected and people are regularly engaging in constructive ways with a government that is supposed to work for them. Civil Safety Corps In the event of public demonstrations or social unrest, police are tasked with maintaining order, but the result is frequently a license for police to harm civilians. Police have even harmed de-escalation teams including city elected officials – Public Advocate Jumaane Williams was assaulted by an NYPD officer while trying to keep the peace during a demonstration in the fall of 2020. If the NYPD reaction to an elected official’s presence is aggression, it is incapable of operating within the confines of the social contract promised between a government and the people it is supposed to protect. Instead of police responders, people demonstrating could be supported with teams of de-escalation and behavioral health experts, and a corps of responders trained in crisis management who are available to provide food, water, medical treatment, and other support for people who are demonstrating. People who are demonstrating need assurance that they will not be met with assault by NYPD officers, including police vehicles driven into crowds, tear-inducing or otherwise harmful chemical compounds, physical force including projectiles, batons or melee weapons, or any type of serious physical danger from police. Example of Use: Building on the work of organizations who have created their own de-escalation and safety training programs for demonstrations, the city funds protest safety trainings, de-escalation training sessions and offers centralized access to volunteer de-escalation/ demonstration marshalling groups to make it easier for groups to connect to these groups and receive support for upcoming demonstrations (much like people request National Lawyers Guild observers now). Agencies Involved New agency Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work CCIT, and others. Democracy Outreach and Protection Corps New York finally has automatic voter registration, but there is much work that needs to be done to ensure every person in the city has the opportunity to voice their view on the future of the city, including non-citizens. Law enforcement should be dissociated from responding to complaints surrounding the democratic process. We could instead establish a Democracy Outreach and Protection Corps that works before an election to identify every person in the city who can vote, and ensure they are registered and know how to vote. During elections it would receive resources to safely staff polling sites, ensure sufficiency of voting locations and poll workers, and provide transportation services to people who need help voting. Example of Use: A local resident who has not voted in 10 years calls the Democracy Protection Corps or visits the website to learn whether they are registered to vote and where they should vote, and are given the option to request transportation to their polling site. Example of Use: A voter feels they are being intimidated as they walk into a polling place. They report the incident to the Democracy Protection Corps who can work with poll workers to ensure that all requirements, such as party affiliates standing the mandated distance from the entrance, are observed. Agencies Involved Civic Engagement Commission (CEC), DemocracyNYC, New York City Campaign Finance Bureau (NYCCFB), Voter Assistance Advisory Committee Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Make the Road, VOCAL, Immigrant Defense Project, New Sanctuary Coalition, and others. Civil Engineer Corps Too often, complaints about inadequate housing, public property or utilities maintenance end up as a police problem. Disputes with landlords can take substantial time to resolve, and may themselves be a product of inadequate collective resources for housing support and maintenance – there may be instances where a landlord wants to fix an issue, but cannot do so without city permission. Lead pipes slated for removal may take far longer to remove than anticipated. Our city could establish a corps of engineers and maintenance workers who are authorized and equipped to repair and maintain housing in the event of a dispute with a landlord, identify long-standing neighborhood infrastructure issues such as lead piping, renovate structures to fit modernized regulations, and ensure people experiencing mechanical problems that need fixing have a rapid response team available at all times. Where the landlord is eventually deemed responsible for the issue, the city can ensure financial resolution through expanding and collaborating with the Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) Alternative Enforcement Program. Example of Use: When someone calls Housing and Preservation to report that the landlord has not fixed the heat and hot water for over 24 hours, the city sends a maintenance worker to fix the issue immediately. If the lack of response is a result of neglect, the landlord will be responsible for the cost of repairs. Agencies Involved Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work New York Junior League Community Improvement Project (NYJL-CIP), Urban Pathways, and others. Civil Equity Research and Data Analysis Transparency Commission Information access points to civilian-government interactions are frequently controlled and often intentionally obfuscated by police. Law enforcement oversees comprehensive, well-funded and real-time data gathering and analysis efforts, which means policymakers looking for information may have few other sources available, may receive flawed data and produce flawed policy as a result. Civilian data analysts working with neighborhood nonprofit and community-based organizations could transparently evaluate all city policies in real-time. Existing data transparency laws should be enforced – too often, agencies ignore them. Requests for information should be granted rapidly. Communities should have control over this process, and ensure the public has access throughout. The Civil Equity Research and Data Analysis Transparency Commission could facilitate enforcement, and gather and release as much data about policies implemented by the city as possible, including race and wealth impact analyses. It could work with city agencies and elected leaders to ensure consistent standards of data collection and transparency, and regularly release reports evaluating agency compliance and assessing short-term steps to improve compliance. The Commission will also be tasked with systematically eliminating use of tools, data and algorithms that are demonstrated to use or perpetuate racially biased or wealth-based policy outcomes. Example of Use: A journalist needs information on information related to policy outcomes in a city agency. The Civil Equity Research and Data Analysis Transparency Commission would help them identify the data, provide it to them, and ensure follow-up questions are answered. Example of Use: A researcher interested in evaluating best-practices in municipal government wants to assess the benefits of a specific city program. The Civil Equity Research and Data Analysis Transparency Commission would share any existing analysis and partner with the researcher to publish evidence-based findings. Example of Use: A community organization believes that budgetary funding for a set of Assessment Algorithms would perpetuate systemic racism in an agency. The organization could file a complaint with the Civil Equity Research and Data Analysis Transparency Commission to halt the program in question and ensure it is no longer used or funded by the City. Agencies Involved Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Progressive Coders Network, Beta NY, Housing Data Coalition, and others. Conservation Corps Green spaces, open areas, public parks, flora and fauna in our city are precious resources that must be protected and nurtured. Policing parks and environmental issues does not work – it perpetuates harm, and rarely holds corporations accountable for patterns of environmental misconduct. New York already has a state-level conservation corps – our city could model and scale up a program based on civil environmental engagement programs that have worked across the country. A Conservation Corps could promote environmental resilience throughout the city in conjunction with appropriate agencies and work in teams to help ensure our green spaces are safe, nourished and well-stewarded for future generations. Teams of corps members could be on-site at every park to help address issues and call for appropriate backup responders when emergencies arise. They could also address problems of local environmental hazards such as lead paint complaints, hazardous waste, and pollution through research, advocacy, and public education. Example of Use: A community resident notices what could be a hazardous chemical in public. The Conservation Corps safely removes the hazard, and works to identify the actor responsible for long-term engagement and accountability so that the hazard is not reproduced. Example of Use: A local park is trashed and vandalized. Young people engage in altercations in the area. Conservation Corps members clean the site, and engage appropriate interagency collaborations that can address the conflicts to prevent future vandalization and harm. Agencies Involved Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Student Conservation Association, Sunrise, and others. Non-Citizen Safety and Outreach Corps Police and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities work hand in hand to target and frequently terrorize immigrants across New York City. Our city must end collaboration with ICE and never allow federal officials to police immigrants. At the same time, the majority of non-English speaking New Yorkers do not receive the services agencies are mandated to provide, and receive delayed and worse care when they do get it. We need oversight hearings and enforcement plans to address these issues. Instead of policing immigration and failing to meet the needs of immigrants, we could establish a Non-Citizen Safety and Outreach Corps to engage in long-term relationship building with people who are newly arrived and long-term immigrants. We could guarantee all residents, including immigrants, the right to vote in our elections. We must meet immigrants’ need for comprehensive legal services with guaranteed access to immigration attorneys during proceedings to avoid downstream collateral consequences. And we have to address the root insecurities too many immigrants experience. Our elected leaders have to hold corporations accountable that steal wages or endanger workers. We can also protect immigrants by fully funding healthcare, clinics and hospitals – the primary points of care for many folks. We need language justice in our districts to ensure people can access information. We have to ensure immigrant communities receive fully funded housing and education opportunities. The Non-Citizen Safety and Outreach Corps would work with immigrants to facilitate access to services including legal support and housing, field and respond to complaints, and ensure the various needs immigrants experience are met. The Corps would hire from and work with local immigrant communities to promote language justice and removal of access barriers, work with people to find employment opportunities, offer education, peer and legal support on the citizenship process or other issues that arise, and help people secure an attorney in the event of federal interference. Example of Use: People newly arrived to the United States move into a neighborhood. The Non-Citizen Safety and Outreach Corps engages with them to ensure they are receiving language justice, access to housing, healthcare, job opportunities and services, as well as opportunity to vote in the next local election. Agencies Involved Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA), new agency Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Immigrant Defense Project, Make the Road, VOCAL, New Sanctuary Coalition, and others. Arts Corps New York City fosters a unique and diverse array of artistic expressions that drive the culture of the world. Police respond to ad hoc art and street-level artistic expression with arrests and incarceration. Graffiti, for example, is seen as a threat, rather than an opportunity to engage someone who may be searching for ways to express themselves artistically. Graffiti should not result in arrests. If people living near it do not like it, they should not have to think about whether the person who made it will end up incarcerated – they should be able to turn to a collective of artists to collaboratively put up a new mural over the graffiti in question, or engage with the people involved to make something the community can be proud of. Instead of policing art, our city could invest in arts programming and an Arts Corps that is tasked with beautifying every neighborhood and public space in New York City, partnering with community organizations to hire local artists to make every area beautiful, and highlighting the artistic expression of our city through media, entertainment opportunities and, as pandemic safety allows, neighborhood block parties. Example of Use: Residents of a building complex are upset by the graffiti that covers the side of their building. Rather than waiting on a delinquent landlord to fix it, or policing the graffiti artist, they work with the NYC Arts Corps to create a facade that supports their vision for their building. Example of Use: Residents would like to host a block party. NYC Arts Corps drops off street barriers, tables, etc., connects residents to local artists and performers and local vendors if desired. It also helps notify surrounding areas so that people are prepared for traffic and other disruptions. Agencies Involved Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work The Creators Collective, Thrive Collective, Free Arts NYC, and others. Press Credentialing The NYPD is currently tasked with determining who is and who is not a credentialed member of the press. This can have a significant impact on reporting integrity – to gain access to press corps benefits, journalists are incentivized to avoid angering the NYPD. The NYPD press gatekeeping function is inherently antidemocratic, because it allows the NYPD to prevent press it may disagree with from receiving credentials needed to cover issues of public importance – and those issues may include police-involved matters. This is a clear conflict of interest. This past summer demonstrated the issue – the NYPD assaulted local journalists reporting on a demonstration and responded to the journalist’s complaints by saying that because the NYPD had not credentialed the journalists as press members, the complaints were invalid. The press is a fundamental part of our democracy, and a free press is prerequisite to functioning democracy. All press credentialing should be handled by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services commissioner, and include input from local community stakeholder organizations, local media outlets, representatives for new or emerging media outlets, and journalist labor unions. Example of Use: A newly-founded publication applies for press credentials in order to cover a large protest. The requirements for receiving credentials are clear, only as restrictive as necessary and public. The publication meets all requirements and receives credentials in a timely manner. Agencies Involved Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, local journalists, and others. Privacy Protection Commission Privacy rights violations are nuanced and require individualized responses. Police responses to privacy rights violations can further violate privacy and exacerbate trauma. People who feel their privacy has been violated could have a safe space to turn to try and resolve the situation in a way that they feel in control and protected, and we have to develop proactive approaches and accountability to digital privacy protection. A Privacy Protection Commission could work with a range of experts to address the various privacy violations, including gender violence through privacy violations, that are only becoming more problematic as our technology advances. Living in a city must not mean that our expectation of and right to privacy turn into a footnote in history. The privacy rights enjoyed by earlier generations could exist for the Internet generations. Systems that track people based on DNA or facial recognition or other pattern identification software effectively eliminate personal privacy. Our city should defund these systems and instead fund programming that protects privacy rights and proactively envisions ways to safeguard personal privacy into the new century. Example of Use: A person who has been filmed without their consent turns to the privacy protection commission, which provides the civil legal support necessary to help the person get their unauthorized image removed from various sites and the original footage confiscated/destroyed. Example of Use: A person’s computer is hacked, including non-consensual removal of private photographs. The person can turn to the Privacy Protection Commission to engage in a rapid, survivor-centered investigation focused on accountability, prevention of dissemination and preventative measures. The person can also receive resources to restore their confidence in their technology such as a new computer or privacy protection training. Agencies Involved Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (DOITT), new agency Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), and others. Civil Public Order and Property Protection Team People often have concerns related to simple property-related issues or public disorder. Police involvement can unnecessarily lead to arrest or incarceration. The Civil Public Order and Property Protection service could include teams of people to take insurance reports and give advice on property protection measures and a robust victim's compensation fund. It would collaborate with other city service providers to develop targeted strategies to address the things that drive property crime including drug addiction and juvenile poverty. Example of Use: A shop is vandalized in the middle of the night. The owner/manager reports the vandalism to the Commission. They are compensated for repairs and given advice on additional property protection measures they can take. Agencies Involved New agency Examples of Community Organizations Doing This Work Restorative Justice Initiative, and others. Acknowledgements and Next Steps Our campaign is working alongside community partners to build a coalition of candidates and elected officials to implement a new vision of public safety. At the beginning of 2022, a multi-committee initiative at the City Council, which will include community stakeholder organizations, will establish the budgetary needs for the agencies and groups that will replace the NYPD. This initiative will determine the best way to bring this plan to life. We are committed to ongoing engagement. This is a living plan that will continue to be informed by communities and people directly impacted by systems of oppression. We will host town halls and ongoing dialogue with our neighbors and neighborhoods across the city to ensure participatory co-governance as we build and implement our new vision for public safety. We will update our plans to reflect community feedback. The Cabán for Council Campaign would like to thank all the community organizations involved in contributing to this plan directly or by already doing the work this proposal calls for.

A Green New Deal For NYC PDF version of Policy Page ABSTRACT / SUMMARY The Green New Deal, and ‘Build Back Better,’ will utilize a system of cooperation and coordination among levels of government in which each level does what it does best. The federal government is best at (1) financing – thanks to the vast lending, borrowing, and spending power of the U.S. Fed and Treasury – and (2) harmonizing efforts among multiple states and localities to ensure they cohere rather than undercutting each other. States and localities are best at determining local needs and imperatives that are not understood in Washington. The Green New Deal will be largely funded and nationally coordinated in Washington, even while funding and nationally harmonizing projects determined by and large locally. New York, including New York City and District 22, will have both opportunities and responsibilities. The opportunity that the Green New Deal will present the City and the District is that of substantial federal funding for ambitious Green New Deal projects in NYC generally and D22 particularly. The corresponding responsibility this will place on NYC and D22 is to conceive and prioritize projects. We as a community must determine what we most need to do to make our city and community healthy, just, and sustainable in the way that the Green New Deal as a whole is meant to make our country itself healthy, just, and sustainable. This process must be participatory. It must center the voices of impacted communities. It must recognize environmental harms perpetuated in systemically racist ways, and it must address those harms through reparative and restorative approaches, as well as through forward-facing equity-focused solutions. In pursuing these solutions, we can create at least 100,000 green jobs, prioritize training in impacted communities for those jobs, and deliver a new care-based economy that is rooted in sustainability and the kind of infrastructural investments that enable our city to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Our district, and districts across the city must meet together in multiple town hall meetings over the next several months to decide upon our most urgent Green New Deal needs. Only a holistic, roundtable approach that starts from a place of community-led decision-making can lead us to a green New York City. BACKGROUND The text of the Green New Deal Resolution introduced in 2019 by Congress Member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey is a framework and a call to action. It calls on us to not only decarbonize each sector of our economy, but to also achieve environmental justice and a maximum amount of jobs for communities that have been ravaged thanks to the fossil fuel industry. The Cabán for Council Green New Deal is centered around reparations, jobs and pandemic recovery. Our plan calls for: Passage of and expansion on the Renewable Rikers Act; shade trees and heat island treatment plans; renewal of the Big Reuse facility’s lease, as well as expansion of food scrap drop off sites so that every person in our district is within 10 minutes’ walk of a site; flood-proofing and resilience-building across our coastlines; permanent open streets and green spaces based on successful models from NYC to Barcelona; comprehensive renovation of our outdated sewage system; new protected bike and bus lanes, as well as renovations to ensure accessibility for people with disability or people who are older; and, across the board, substantial and sustained infrastructure and job investments that increase our city’s renewable energy capacity as well as our ability to provide union jobs for environmental purposes. Reparations Most discussion of climate reparations has taken place on an international scale, with advocates calling for wealthier nations that have profited most from fossil fuel consumption to pay for climate change mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries now bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. As this idea gains momentum, experts and activists have advocated a similar framework of justice on a local scale. In New York and elsewhere, state and local governments have sued oil companies for their contributions to climate change. While these lawsuits are justified, they are insufficient; for example, Mayor de Blasio’s federal lawsuit against the five biggest publicly traded oil companies was thrown out. More effective climate reparations involve direct public investments in communities affected by environmental injustice. This approach recognizes “historical environmental racism and intersectional drivers of precarious lives, social trauma, and displacement beyond those narrowly associated with ‘climate.’ It embeds climate debt in longer historical time frames of infrastructural reparations.” Climate reparations must include investments in economic opportunity and infrastructure in historically marginalized communities, as well as initiatives to eliminate pollution, create green spaces and improve public health in those same communities. Such projects can take many forms in D22. For example, instead of giving vacant lots to real estate developers, such land should be used to build affordable housing units or communal parks. Meanwhile, Council must work with Albany to pass higher taxes on real estate developers and the wealthiest New Yorkers to help finance green projects, on top of federal funding. Climate reparations means holding energy companies accountable for abuses and using revenues from fines to compensate overcharged tenants. Climate reparations includes recognizing historical environmental injustices and centering communities in redressing them. The New York City government should acknowledge environmental harms through public education and public apology, which will in turn raise awareness and support for climate reparations. Ultimately, community members’ climate reparation priorities should shape funding priorities. Jobs and Pandemic Recovery The Covid pandemic has ravaged New York’s small businesses, and the federal stimulus package in addition to future legislation could provide relief. This money should be spent to bring more resilient small businesses, responsive to their local communities, back to New York. Our city should foster the creation and spreading of employee-owned firms, and other firms whose owners reside where their places of business are located, in both the City generally and D22 particularly. Labor sourcing can also be addressed through Council legislation. An equitable recovery would include training programs for a new green construction force with good-paying union jobs, which will be essential in the coming years through NYC. Union protections, good wages,and safe conditions should be fundamental to these projects. Therefore, the Council should tie city funding to project-labor agreement (PLA) usage. PLAs ensure union coverage on jobsites, increasing safety and ensuring communities benefit through job creation. As the city will be providing loans to many building owners to fund work in order to meet compliance, these loans can be tied to PLA usage. An act from the Council requiring this would bring a boom to the union construction industry while benefiting all workers on these job sites. An alternative plan might scale up project bundling (i.e. bring three nearby apartments looking for green loans into the same project) and mandate PLAs among those nearby job sites, while establishing mechanisms to maintain local control over project implementation. Low interest rates from the city could incentivize this and provide further reasons to conduct this work. The City Council should also facilitate youth hiring through expansion of the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) to offer more local environmental jobs, especially in environmental justice communities such as D22. ACTION PLANS Process: City and District Green New Deal Issues Meetings Our office will work with neighborhood, school, faith, and other civic leaders throughout D22 to set up town halls that establish sustainability needs to be addressed neighborhood by neighborhood. The issues constituents raise at each meeting will be compiled into a comprehensive and coherent D22 Green New Deal issues list. The office will regularly and transparently provide status updates on every item and the remaining steps necessary to secure funding. A youth climate council reflecting the diversity of D22 will advise the office on climate policy. The Green New Deal will never be a ‘done deal.’ It is a process of continual local renewal that is guided by ongoing democratic dialogue. Local issues meetings will be ongoing, to meet the evolving needs and wishes of the City’s and District’s own residents. Possible Green New Deal Projects Green New Deal Projects for the 22nd District: Power Generation: Background: Fossil-fuel plants, and peaker plants in particular, release air pollutants that affect the health of all residents of D22. NYC neighborhood health profiles report increased rates of asthma and higher levels of fine particulate matter in our District compared to the NYC average. That is the source of the nickname ‘Asthma Alley’ for Astoria. The Renewable Rikers Act was signed into law on Feb. 25, 2021. It is a package of legislation that transfers a portion of Rikers Island from the Department of Corrections (DOC) to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) and initiates a study of renewable energy generation and storage there. Solutions: The Renewable Rikers conversion must be a top priority. It is urgent and critical that we replace ‘peaker plants’ with renewable sources of power generation, including Renewable Rikers, as quickly as possible. For example, we can develop an electricity storage system on Rikers Island that integrates renewable generation and helps meet continually varying electricity demand across New York City. The transition to a Renewable Rikers can also provide reparations to marginalized communities by prioritizing jobs for past victims of our criminal legal system and by providing clean, cheap power to communities like those in D22 that have had historically high rates of air pollution. Funds to transition D22 away from fossil fuel peaker plants should also be used to build free public health clinics in D22, where victims of particulate matter in Astoria’s “Asthma Alley” deserve reparations for the health consequences they have suffered due to oil-burning peaker plants. Shade Trees and Environmentally Safe Fans & Air Conditioning: Background: Our District contains many heat islands – areas that are typically 2-3°F warmer than the average temperature in NYC – in multiple locations. Resident’s of the D22 are accordingly more vulnerable to heat-related deaths and health complications than is the typical New Yorker. Making the problem worse is the fact that 6-7% of homes in the D22 do not have air conditioners. The existence of heat islands has also been linked to previously redlined districts, meaning that this priority has reparations significance in addition to general quality of life significance. Solutions: Our city should engage in a comprehensive effort to plant shade trees in every neighborhood, and provide state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable fans or air conditioners in all of D22’s ‘heat islands.’ We could increase funds to NYC Parks in order to expand the NYC Street Tree Planting program. The city should expand the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) Cooling Assistance Component benefit, which currently offers a limited number of free air conditioners for people with medical conditions. It should also expand the NYC Cooling Assistance benefit that helps eligible households buy and install an air conditioner or fan up to a cost of $800, prioritizing vulnerable communities like nursing homes to meet the target community needs above. These programs should coordinate with NYCHA to expand and improve upon their ‘Smart Window Air Conditioners” and “Air Source Heat Pumps” pilot programs in order to bring energy efficient cooling systems to every NYCHA resident. Composting & Recycling: Background: Composting and recycling reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create job opportunities. D22 has been on the frontline of the multiyear struggle to get the city government to take composting seriously, and through the work of on-the-ground organizers has become a composting leader in a city that right now lacks infrastructure necessary to meet its carbon neutral goals. Our district should be the model for how the city develops and implements its composting and recycling infrastructure. We saw firsthand that political rhetoric on composting often does not live up to on-the-ground reality – just one painful example is the much-promoted curbside pickup program that initially saw $20 million in funding that slowly dwindled while the on-the-ground program continues to fail to meet its goals. Climate activists have worked hard to ensure composting accessibility despite the city’s failure to do so; now, most of District 22 is within walking distance of food scrap drop off sites. The problems with the curbside pickup program and the political failure to ensure its success means elected officials are obligated to prove their credibility on climate, and the best way to do that is to directly empower the people and organizations in D22 doing the work that is making our district a citywide leader in composting and recycling. . That work has been substantially more difficult during the pandemic, with curbside pickup suspended entirely and many food scrap drop-off sites shut down. Because of work by groups like Astoria Pug and others, D22 has as many food scrap drop off sites as any other district with 9. According to Astoria Pug, right now roughly 87% of District 22 lives within 10 minutes of a food scrap drop off site, a testament to the power of organizing in climate advocacy groups. At the same time, our core composting capacity is at dire risk as the current Parks Department is refusing to renew the lease of the Big Reuse composting facility. Big Reuse is responsible for 70% of our area’s food scrap recycling capacity – if the Parks Department insists on evicting Big Reuse even though it has regularly renewed leases in the past, the result will be our district simply cannot make meaningful progress toward carbon neutrality until a similar facility is established. In other words, the fate of our city, the status of D22 as a green leader in the city, and our long-term capacity-building goals in terms of resilience and recycling are all being put at risk by an arbitrary decision from the Parks Department. Solutions: Big Reuse must not be evicted; the Parks Department must renew the lease right away. The eviction of Big Reuse would single-handedly eliminate D22’s status as climate leader while simultaneously putting our composting capacity as a city at serious risk. These are core issues – if we fail to do this basic step, we may as well admit our city will not be carbon neutral by 2030. There is no carbon neutral NYC without a renewed Big Reuse lease. Beyond securing the future of Big Reuse, it is past time that we reopen, expand and create new food scrap and recycling drop-off sites throughout the District and provide home composting containers and recycling bins to D22 residents who wish to use them. Every building should have access to a composting and recycling site, and every neighborhood should have access to large-scale sites that can handle the city’s goal to get to zero waste by 2030. We must simultaneously engage in targeted expansion of food scrap and recycling drop-off sites in order to reduce the amount of walk time and increase widespread education, support, and adoption. Our goal should be that 100% of D22’s population is within a 10 minute walk of a food scrap drop off site over the next two years, and we should be making serious strides toward increasing the share of the population within 5 minutes of a drop-off site over these next two years as well. We can do it by funding with the groups on the ground already doing the work. People want to recycle and compost when it is accessible and convenient – we should guarantee that accessibility and convenience. We also have to make our recycling efforts more holistic and interconnected across agencies and government programs. For example, the DOE Office of Sustainability also runs a Zero Waste Pledge Schools Program. In FY20, 46 educators reached 23 schools to build recycling and waste reduction efforts, leaving over a thousand schools without the same guidance. City Council should provide funding to expand the Zero Waste Program, especially to D22 schools in typically low-income communities historically underserved by the city’s waste services. Establishing a culture of responsibility on both the sides of students and their city government now will help ensure sustainable and proper waste management later. Flood-Proofing: Background: Our District is vulnerable to hurricane flooding. Resilient Neighborhoods – a place-based planning initiative to identify neighborhood-specific strategies, including zoning and land use changes, to support the vitality and resiliency of communities in the floodplain and prepare them for future storms – does not currently plan any projects for our District. We can and must act both to change that and to develop measures of our own within D22. Solutions: We must convene roundtables of experts, communities, and advocates to develop flood-mitigation plans and facilities across the city including for D22, including floodwalls, better drainage, and flood-proofing building technology. We should also accelerate production of a resiliency plan for D22 that considers land use and zoning. These plans should hold developers accountable for preventing inland flooding using a holistic flood proofing plan that doesn’t protect luxury high rises at the expense of inland neighborhoods. Sewage Projects: Background: There are currently no sewage projects listed in the City’s capital budget that fall solely within D22. There are millions authorized to borough-wide projects, but whether this will be adequate for D22 needs cannot be known until we assess our own needs. Solutions: D22 should proactively assess our current and likely future sewage needs and determine whether current capacity is sufficient. This includes the construction upgrades of sanitary and storm sewers, water mains and appurtenances, the emergency reconstruction of sewers damaged by Sandy and other severe weather events, and improving storm drainage systems to improve sanitation and sustainability. Permanent Open Streets and Green Spaces Background: We deserve to have safe, open and clean public space. D22 streets have flourished since the city closed them off to most car traffic. Open Street policies allow local areas to become a safe space to exercise and make local parks a more relaxing environment. Open Street policies allow pedestrians, children, our neighbors with mobility assistive devices, cyclists, and families to enjoy a public space without excessive cars, noise, pollution, or danger. Solution: We must create and expand permanent open streets and green space for arts and cultural venues, restaurant seating, street vendors, retail, and other uses to bolster economic recovery. The city needs to expand safe open streets for pedestrians, so that our streets can be used for walking, for children to play and for outdoor dining, cultural events and retail. In particular, we must expand open streets in historically marginalized communities to ensure a more equitable distribution of public space. We will work with community stakeholders and government officials to make New York’s successful experiment in open streets permanent and larger. The city should create 1,000 lane miles of permanent Open Streets, a dramatic increase from Mayor de Blasio’s pledge of 100 miles. This Open Streets plan should include large pedestrian-only zones on major thoroughfares and in central business districts, including in D22. In the interim, we must provide financial and material resources for the continued maintenance and logistics of a volunteer-led open streets program that has been so successful to date. Community participation in Open Streets enables neighborhoods and community groups to define their own needs for the open space. Transit & Biking Background: We can improve living conditions for D22 residents by improving air quality, reducing noise pollution, encouraging social and physical activity, and increasing accessibility through transit and biking upgrades. In order to advance these priorities and meet our climate goals, we must reduce car and truck transportation, which are the city’s second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. As a start, we could convert 25 percent of the space currently devoted for cars into space for people. This means creating 500 lane miles of bus-only lanes and 500 lane miles of protected bike paths. Creating 500 additional miles of bus and bike lanes would ensure every New Yorker lives within a quarter mile of a bus and bike lane connected to a citywide arterial network. Experience has shown that where we convert just one lane of car traffic into a car-free busway, we can quickly increase bus ridership by 17% or more and make commutes significantly faster. Reliable, accessible and safe transportation alternatives will ensure we do our part to meet NYCs climate goals. Solution: In order to encourage wider use of public transportation, we must also fund capital projects to repair and improve tunnels, bridges, trains and buses, to ensure faster, more reliable commutes. New York City must use relief funds from the federal government to fully fund its capital infrastructure program, which will cost at least $12 billion. Capital projects should include investments in renewable energy, for example, to ensure that in D22 and beyond every bus shelter is powered by solar power and every subway station has regenerative elevators. In addition the MTA must accelerate its commitment to switch to an all-electric bus fleet by 2040. Green New Deal Projects for the Full City: Citywide Counterparts to D22 Projects: To begin with, many of the City’s other Districts will need projects like those she has suggested above for D22. The Mayor, the Comptroller, and the Council should facilitate counterpart projects throughout the City. Every District in the City must be individually addressed and included, in ways demanded by residents, in the City’s Green New Deal. City-wide building retrofitting is critical given existing legislation largely avoids touching, affordable housing, and the improvements to NYC department of education to ensure a sustainable future for all children of New York City. Retrofitting Buildings: Background: In 2019, the New York City Council passed Local Law 97 (LL97), an act that would cut large building emissions by 40% of 2005 levels, leading up to a 2030 deadline. While LL97 is a revolutionary act, there are still some blind spots to address, such as LL97 compliance requirements for buildings; the decarbonization of public and affordable housing; and the allocation of jobs and workforce development funds. Effective building compliance requirements are at risk with LL97. The Office of Building Energy and Emissions Performance (OBEEP) has been established to oversee standards and conduct rulemaking. Within the next year, OBEEP will issue recommendations on alternate compliance applications, such as whether or not energy credits will count towards compliance with building emissions limits. These alternatives would water down standards and give building owners new ways to skirt regulations, while hurting underserved communities by shifting the cost from carbon emitters in those communities. Council funding for NYCHA retrofits is essential. NYCHA buildings consume 40%-50% more energy per square foot than the typical NYC multi-family building, while providing unhealthy home environments that lack comfort and safety. NYCHA residents face greater asthma rates, worse health conditions, and more dangerous settings than more efficient neighborhoods, and the Council must step in to end this. Alongside public housing, affordable housing has been mostly cut out from LL97 requirements. Specifically, building owners of buildings with more than 35% “affordable” units will not have to improve energy efficiency and air quality standards anytime soon. If not addressed, this will further exacerbate inequitable environmental harms for people living in affordable housing. Federal Building Back Better funding will help retrofit these buildings, which will require jobs. If we invest $7 billion over three years into energy efficiency infrastructure projects in New York City, it could create 42,210 direct and indirect jobs. This will require much labor and hence offer many new job opportunities to those in the D22 who are un- or under-employed. New York City’s building emissions crisis can only be resolved through bottom-up economic movement. Solutions: The Council needs to codify LL97 mechanisms and applications, stating that the only way to be in compliance is to invest in NYC’s housing stock. This will ensure building owners live up to the spirit of LL97 and perform actual and meaningful improvements to the building’s carbon emissions output. However, to properly meet these goals, OBEEP needs to ensure that it has the capacity to work with building owners and check their records. For LL97 to meet its policy goals, the agency enforcing it must have the proper inspectors and workforce to keep building owners on target. There is a significant risk of buildings failing compliance tests in the first years of implementation – OBEEP needs the funds necessary to counter this. Climate reparations must include retrofits of energy inefficient buildings – starting with long neglected public housing units in D22. The Climate Works for All plan provides mechanisms to access city, state, federal, and FEMA funds, and lays out a roadmap for creating 100,000 green jobs. The Council should implement retrofit ideas, such as funding for small, rent-regulated houses and NYCHA developments. Likewise, the Green New Deal for NYCHA (GND for NYCHA) presents great opportunities to reduce emissions among these buildings while maximizing and centering opportunities for jobs, contracting, and decision-making in public housing residents. Massive capital investment will pay for itself in energy savings and climate harm reduction. The New York City government should flex its purchasing power and inspire growth in local renewable energy production. This will provide building owners with much needed relief by expanding their choices in building electricity providers. Additionally, the City and state should increase funds to small businesses to install clean energy systems in buildings with more than 35% affordable housing units. It is critical that these projects employ local residents, particularly from historically marginalized communities, to retrofit buildings in their neighborhood – starting with public housing units – to include state-of-the-art windows, solar panels, batteries or other energy-saving mechanisms, and more. As we prepare for federal investments to retrofit buildings, we can be proactive and prepare New Yorkers for these opportunities. We should invest in the future of New York City by funding apprenticeship training and labor-management training programs across all sectors, and we should also coordinate with NYCHA to improve and upgrade their Jobs-Plus and REES programs for residents. Climate & Sustainability In Our Schools: Background: Climate education cannot be implemented in a vacuum. To address climate racism institutionally, we must desegregate our public schools and allocate resources more equitably. Overhaul of the system that upholds educational inequity is the only method of truly empowering Black, Brown, low-income and disabled students, and their empowerment is central to our reasoning for implementing climate education. They are the leaders whom we will need to innovate and execute just solutions to this problem, which they know from personal experience. A Green New Deal for Schools would retrofit school buildings and push for the City to develop and enhance its own curriculum and programs on sustainability education in-school. Solutions: A guiding light should be the newly unveiled national plan, “A Green Stimulus For K-12 Schools,” authored by the Climate + Community Project in partnership with Congressman Jamaal Bowman. The proposal calls for a $1.16 trillion investment to fund climate-friendly retrofits at every K-12 public school nationwide, to hire and train more teachers, and to increase funding for low-income and disability-focused programs. If enacted, this plan would decrease carbon emissions, reduce class sizes, create more than 3 million jobs – from construction to teaching jobs – and support climate justice school curriculums. School retrofits would include installations of solar panels and batteries, repairs and upgrades to plumbing, lighting and other infrastructure, and renovations to improve student health by remediating lead, asbestos, mold and other harms. Such national legislation could work in concert with state and local legislation advancing sustainability and climate resilience efforts. It is in the interest of the City and all of our residents to teach children both the why’s and the how’s of sustainability and environmental justice. In April 2016, the New York City Council adopted Res. 0375, which calls on the New York State Department of Education to develop lessons on climate change for K-12 public schools’ curricula. However, as of the 2020-21 school year, no such lessons have been standardized or required across the public school system. Too often, the onus to offer climate education falls solely on a given school’s Sustainability Coordinator – i.e., a teacher who serves as the designated school liaison to the New York City Department of Education Office of Sustainability. The City Council must also renew its pressure on the State to pass and implement climate education in New York public schools. Currently, three New York State Senate bills on climate education lie in committee. First, S6837 would establish a grant program to fund climate education or professional development training. Second, S7341 would mandate that the commissioner of education create a model K-12 environmental curriculum, with topics including climate change, environmental justice, and public health, to be taught in science, history, social studies, and health classes. Third, S596 would require the commissioner of education to make recommendations to the Board of Regents to adopt instruction of climate science in public high schools. S596 has garnered significant momentum through the organizing work of the Climate and Resilience Education Task Force (CRETF), a National Wildlife Federation initiative. S596 is also the only bill that seeks to ensure students understand climate change before graduating from the public school system. Local organizations including TREEage, Sunrise and Our Climate are working alongside CRETF to modify and improve the language of S596 to mandate that more climate topics are taught. Beyond providing for climate instruction, the City Council must authorize increased funding for the DOE Office of Sustainability to support hands-on environmental learning through grants and initiatives. The Office’s sustainability programming has expanded significantly in the last fiscal year. For example, it now oversees a Youth Leadership Council of high school students and also includes a Living Lab series, in which select schools teach sustainability using the school facility as an example (e.g. studying the school facility’s energy efficiency). The reach of these programs must increase dramatically to educate the majority of students who have yet to meaningfully engage in Office of Sustainability programming, especially students from environmental justice communities such as D22. To this end, the City Council should increase funding for the Office’s Sustainability Project Grant program, which awarded only $385K to 98 schools in 2020 for projects in environmental education, energy conservation and gardening, among other things. The Office relies on funds from the Demand Response Program, through which City agencies earn revenue by reducing their energy usage during peak hours. This year, additional funds came from the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability and the Department of Citywide Administrative Services-Division of Energy Management’s ExCEL Program. To support school-directed environmental education programming in the coming years, the City Council must provide substantial additional funding for the Office of Sustainability’s grant program. Conclusion The Green New Deal is in some ways a daunting proposition, requiring as it does much urgent action in many domains. That will be as true of our City’s and District’s renditions of the Green New Deal as it is of the national Green New Deal. Mitigating the challenges, however, will be both the massive federal funding for our efforts and the significance of what we will have achieved within months and even weeks of commencing. With more federal funding than has been forthcoming in many generations, residents of New York City’s 22nd District and of the City at large will now render each other’s lives far more sustainable – and far more worth sustaining – according to our own determinations than ever before.

In its hearings this session, W&GE has heard from scores of courageous survivors, who have told the committee their painful stories and urged the Council to take action to meet their needs. Again and again, they have identified economic support and a comprehensive guide to available services as key ways the Council can make New York a more supportive city for survivors. This package delivers on those pleas as Domestic Violence Awareness Month comes to an end. Domestic violence is by far the biggest cause of New Yorkers entering the DHS shelter system ( Housing Survivors How New York City Can Increase Housing Stability for Survivors of Domestic Violence , Comptroller, 2019). While there are many great resources in the City, there are few that trust survivors of violence to know exactly what they need, and equip them with the funds to make decisions in their best interest. This package consists of three items related to services for survivors of violence, particularly domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence: Int 0153-2022 (introduced along with CMs Hanif, Louis, Ayala, Ung, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams) will establish a program of low-barrier, broad-use, urgently accessible grants for survivors. Int 0154-2022 (introduced along with CMs Riley, Louis, Ayala, Ung, and PA Williams) will expand the HOPE portal and establish a new printed guide of resources where the many city- and CBO-provided survivor services are aggregated – and translated into the major languages, including braille – for easy access. Res 0111-2022 (introduced along with PA Williams) calls on Albany to provide paid leave for survivors, ideally as a stepping stone to universal paid leave. “It’s time we did right by survivors,” said Council Member Tiffany Cabán . “Along with my colleagues, I am committed to removing the barriers to accessing services that the Committee on Women and Gender Equity has found survivors face, as well as proactively establishing the programs that survivors say they need. The ‘Support Survivors’ legislative package is a bold step toward a city where survivors of violence can find healing, growth, and safety. For too long, this city has cynically used survivors’ trauma and pain merely as a pretext to ramp up policing, prosecution, and incarceration, leaving the actual survivors without access to the services and protections they need. No more.” “The Supporting Survivors package passed today by the first women-majority Council is an incredibly powerful step toward intersectional justice for women and survivors across the city. As rates of Domestic Violence in the Bronx and across the City continue to grow it is incredibly urgent that our local government acts quickly to support our communities. I am proud to see that the New York City Council is moving our City toward prioritizing the needs of women. As Domestic Violence Awareness month comes to an end we cannot forget how much work we have to do when it comes to supporting the economic development that our survivors not only need, but deserve. I look forward to continuing to fight for more direct resources and investments to help end domestic and gender based violence,” said Council Member Amanda Farías, co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus. “As a member of the first women majority Council in our City’s history, I couldn’t be prouder that today we are taking action to support survivors of domestic violence,” said Council Member Shahana Hanif . “Last year, there were almost 100,000 reported cases of domestic violence in our City and we simply aren’t doing enough to give survivors the help they need. The Support Survivors package is a monumental, gender-responsive step in providing real City-backed resources to help survivors get back on their feet. Our work is far from over, but this women-led Council is ready to continue fighting.” “I am proud to stand with my colleagues in a women-led City Council to state unequivocally to survivors of domestic and gender-based violence that we have your back. My colleagues have done more than hear survivors– the bill sponsors of the Support Survivors legislative package have worked collaboratively with survivors to center their experience to craft legislation that will create positive change. I look forward to the passage of these bills which will remove barriers on the road to stability and safety,” said Council Member Carlina Rivera. “In 2020, over 200,000 domestic violence incidents were reported to the NYPD — and we know that number is just the tip of the iceberg. It is vital that NYC is doing everything in our power to ensure we are not enabling the re-victimization of survivors through a lack of resources, or disparate access to those resources,” said Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez. “ I am deeply proud of my colleague Council Member Caban for fighting tirelessness to deliver this critical assistance to survivors.” “The Support Survivors Legislative Package is a vital step to guaranteeing true justice for our communities when it comes to sexual and intimate partner violence,” said Council Member Crystal Hudson, co-Chair of the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. “The bills in the package, Int. 0153 and Int. 0154, prioritize the care of our neighbors and ensure that survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence have access to the resources that will allow them to heal with the safety and dignity we all deserve. As a community, the CDC reports that queer folks experience sexual violence at higher rates than their straight counterparts. And, within the LGBTQIA+ community, transgender people and bisexual women face the most alarming rates of sexual violence. Put simply, these laws will have an immediate, tangible impact on all communities impacted by sexual and intimate partner violence.” “As an attorney who has worked with domestic violence survivors, I know how difficult it can be for a person to leave an abusive situation,” said Council Member Sandra Ung. ‘In many cases, a major factor is that they are financially dependent on their abuser. These crucial pieces of legislation will not only provide survivors with the financial help they need to leave their abusers, but make it easier for them to access the services they need as they begin a courageous new chapter in their lives. I want to thank Council Member Tiffany Caban and my co-sponsors on these bills for their advocacy and support on behalf of survivors.” “Survivors of color face numerous barriers to accessing services. Since the pandemic, our Anti-Violence Program has seen a 40% increase in need and doubling in high-risk cases—cases with a homicidal or suicidal risk. We, alongside our partners, celebrate the passage of the Support Survivors Package. The Package is a major step in ensuring all survivors in NYC have the support they deserve,” said Rawaa Nancy Albilal, President & CEO of the Arab-American Family Support Center. “For the past 14 years, across Astoria and NYC, we have been organizing on issues of domestic violence and so little has changed. In fact the confluence of the pandemic and the current economic crisis has only made things worse, especially for the working class immigrant women we serve. The Support Survivors Package would radically improve material conditions for survivors and make safety more accessible for them and their families. Especially in the midst of both a housing and economic crisis, survivors need paid leave, more accessible services and financial support. This would allow so many members of our community who are stuck in the cycle and harsh reality of gender violence every day to access support. This would save lives,” said Rana Abdelhamid, Executive Director and Founder, Malikah . “We are tremendously grateful to Council Member Cabán and each member of the Council that has co-sponsored the Support Survivors Legislative Package, especially Intro 153-A. For too long, domestic violence has been the number one driver of family homelessness in New York City. Most survivors have also endured economic abuse and have been stripped from their social safety nets. Establishing a housing stability program that provides low-barrier grants and support services for survivors will help them avoid shelter entry and foster stability. We urge the Council to pass and Mayor to sign the legislative package and to invest adequate funding,” said Nicole Branca, Executive Director of New Destiny Housing . “Day One applauds the passage of the Support Survivors act. We are excited that new measures will create and expand pathways to safety for youth seeking to leave abusive relationships. Day One looks forward to working with the Council on more ways to serve young survivors and to address the unique issues they face,” said Andrew Sta. Ana, Director of Law and Policy, Day One. “As a survivor of domestic violence, these bills are a step in the right direction to getting women and other survivors the services they need. With 93% of women diverted from Rikers having experienced sexual, physical or emotional violence, these measures will also help prevent incarceration and keep families together.” Leah Fair, Senior Community Organizer Women’s Community Justice Association “The Support Survivors package centers the fact that you cannot separate economic abuse from domestic violence and that the two are interconnected for nearly all survivors. We are glad to see that this package provides survivors and their families with the much needed immediate, low barrier direct financial support that survivors crucially need. As the largest provider of domestic violence services and support in the country, URI is grateful to Councilmember Caban for seeing the bills over the finish line and we look forward to our continuing work together to address and remove the financial barriers to safety and to support healing for survivors of domestic violence,” said Teal Inzunza, Program Director, Economic Empowerment Program at Urban Resource Institute. “The New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault is thrilled by the passage of these survivor-centered bills.  In the midst of the trauma COVID-19 brought to New York over the past two and a half years, sexual violence has continued to impact our communities at increasing rates.  At the Alliance, we have heard loud and clear from New York City’s rape crisis centers of the need for more collaboration in order to better meet the increasingly complex needs of sexual violence survivors. The service portal and resource guide will be a valuable tool for advocates to make informed referrals and better collaborate in order to support these survivors. We are grateful to Councilmember Cabán and the bill co-sponsors for focusing on the need to support this vulnerable population.” Emily Miles, Executive Director of New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault “LGBTQ survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence experience higher barriers to safety, support, and services, and the Support Survivors bill package takes steps to make urgent and long-term support more accessible for survivors. At the New York City Anti-Violence Project, 65% of the survivors we support are queer and trans people of color, and many do not want to report incidents to the police” said Audacia Ray (they/she), Director of Community Organizing and Public Advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. “The Support Survivors bill package makes it possible for survivors to access grants that can help them navigate the economic consequences of violence which include housing instability, food insecurity, ongoing medical bills, and other expenses for themselves and their children.” Posted in Uncategorized Council Member Tiffany Cabán’s “Support Survivors” Legislative Package Passes NYC Council Vote October 27, 2022 At today’s Stated Meeting of the New York City Council, the “Support Survivors” legislative package, introduced by Council Member Tiffany Cabán, Chair of the Committee on Women and Gender Equity (W&GE), passed by a vote of 45-6. In its hearings this session, W&GE has heard from scores of courageous survivors, who have told the committee their painful stories and urged the Council to take action to meet their needs. Again and again, they have identified economic support and a comprehensive guide to available services as key ways the Council can make New York a more supportive city for survivors. This package delivers on those pleas as Domestic Violence Awareness Month comes to an end. Domestic violence is by far the biggest cause of New Yorkers entering the DHS shelter system ( Housing Survivors How New York City Can Increase Housing Stability for Survivors of Domestic Violence , Comptroller, 2019). While there are many great resources in the City, there are few that trust survivors of violence to know exactly what they need, and equip them with the funds to make decisions in their best interest.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 22 Tiffany Cabán Astoria (North)-Ditmars-Steinway, Old Astoria-Hallets Point, Astoria (Central), Astoria (East)-Woodside (North), Queensbridge-Ravenswood-Dutch Kills, Rikers Island, St. Michael's Cemetery, Astoria Park, Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, LaGuardia Airport Council Member Tiffany Cabán Introduces Bill to Track Property Seized by NYPD and DAs, Resolution in Support of PromPT Stability Act September 14, 2022 At today’s Stated Meeting of the New York City Council, Council Member Tiffany Cabán introduced Int 0657-2022 , a bill designed to track the property seized by District Attorneys. Joining Cabán as sponsors of the bill were Council Members Althea Stevens, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Shahana Hanif. “District Attorneys seize money and property left and right,” said Council Member Tiffany Cabán . “No due process is afforded those whose assets are being seized. They do not get their property back, even if the case is dismissed. They might not even be the target of a search warrant or investigation, but their property is liable to be seized just because they live there. Transparency and accountability are sorely needed. During budget hearings, DAs come and tell us that they haven’t got the funds necessary to implement vital criminal legal reforms, and plead for ever more money from us on the Council. We can’t assess the merits of these claims and pleas if we don’t know the status of the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of seized assets they’re sitting on. If DAs want more money from us come budget time, they’re at least going to have to be open and transparent about what they’re doing with these funds.” Close Rosies issued the following statement: “New York State prosecutors are required to return property turned over willingly or confiscated: but District Attorneys do not always return property after charges have been dropped as was the case of one of our Close Rosie’s members. Even when the property was finally returned the DAs office pretended they had not forensically evaluated it when evidence of device extraction software was found. Reporting on property seizures, auctions and device extractions is an initial step towards reigning-in decades old bad practices and impugn our ability to succeed in civil right actions.” “Far too often, the NYPD has seized and held property without so much as a document noting what they took. This practice is regularly abused and often leaves those targeted by the police with less than they had before their interactions with the NYPD. This must be stopped,” said Council Member Shahana Hanif . “I’m glad to be signing on to Council Member Cabán’s bill to mandate reporting on seized property by each district attorney. This legislation will provide a real paper trail and make it possible for thousands of people to reclaim what is rightfully theirs.” Additionally, Council Member Cabán  introduced Res 0309-2022 , a resolution in support of S.2832B, introduced by NYS Senator Jessica Ramos, and A.4558B, introduced by Assembly Member Dan Quart – the Promoting Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act. Joining Cabán as sponsors of the bill were Council Members Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Shahana Hanif. “Learn the name Shamika Crawford,” said Council Member Tiffany Cabán . “In 2019, she was arrested based on a vaguely-worded misdemeanor assault complaint filed by her sometime boyfriend. Judges issued a pretrial stay-away order, separating her from her children, forcing her out of her own NYCHA apartment, and rendering her homeless for nearly three months. Ms. Crawford is far from alone. From my time as a public defender, I know full well that the NYPD will frequently arrest both people involved in a domestic dispute, and whoever gets in front of a judge first is granted the order of protection and allowed to go home, while the other is shut out. Unsurprisingly, even though rates of domestic violence are similar across socioeconomic status and ethnicity, it is poor and working class Black and brown New Yorkers who tend to come before the court. Let’s honor Shamika Crawford and so many more like her, and pass this resolution in support of the Promoting Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act.” “Every day in Bronx Criminal Court, people are made homeless and separated from their families by orders of protection that are rubberstamped without any real process,” said Julia Solomons, Senior Policy Social Worker at The Bronx Defenders . “Since the 1st Department decision in Crawford v. Ally was issued last spring, we are finally seeing some progress on this issue but the only way to ensure true due process and minimize the harmful consequences of wrongful orders of protection is to pass legislation codifying the right to a hearing. We are grateful to CM Caban for introducing this resolution, and urge the City Council to immediately vote on and pass it.” “Temporary orders of protection disenfranchise the most marginalized New Yorkers by making housing, employment, and education even more difficult to obtain while they await their day in court. These orders have immense consequences for young people, families, LGBTQ+ people, criminalized survivors of violence, noncitizens, and people experiencing housing instability. Albany must safeguard against arbitrary orders and ensure that legally innocent people maintain their liberty, housing, and public benefits by passing the PromPT Stability Act without delay,” said Jared Trujillo, Policy Counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union . “In our flawed criminal justice system, far too often do we see tools of protection weaponized against the most vulnerable. While Temporary Orders of Protection are needed in certain situations, their overuse and lack of due process protections has hurt far too many and requires reform,” said Council Member Shahana Hanif . “I’m proud to sign on to Council Member Cabán’s resolution to call on our state to pass the Prompt Stability Act to make the necessary changes to our pre-trial system to ensure everyone can remain safe throughout difficult court proceedings. Our state legislature and governor must act to pass this legislation before more people end up homeless, jobless, or hurt.” “Automatic, full criminal court orders of protection have devastating impacts on many New Yorkers – including homelessness and family separation. Courts must consider the unique needs of individual cases and craft individualized solutions that promote true safety for families,” said Yung-Mi Lee, Legal Director of the Criminal Practice at Brooklyn Defender Services . “Brooklyn Defender Services commends the New York City Council and Council Member Tiffany Caban for championing the Promote Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act to strengthen New Yorkers’ due-process rights. We join the Council in calling on the New York State legislature to pass and the Governor to sign the PromPT Stability Act into law.” Posted in Uncategorized Council Member Tiffany Cabán Introduces Bill to Track Property Seized by NYPD and DAs, Resolution in Support of PromPT Stability Act September 14, 2022 At today’s Stated Meeting of the New York City Council, Council Member Tiffany Cabán introduced Int 0657-2022 , a bill designed to track the property seized by District Attorneys.

Where an employer fails to timely provide a written explanation to an employee, the discharge shall not be deemed to be based on just cause. e.

Electronic monitoring. a. 1. Employers may not rely on data collected through electronic monitoring in discharging or disciplining an employee unless the employer can establish before each use that (i) there is no other practical means of tracking or assessing employee performance; (ii) the employer is using the least invasive form of electronic monitoring available; and (iii) the employer previously provided notice to the employee of that monitoring as required by this section. 2.   Employers cannot establish the practical necessity for electronic monitoring without previously filing with the department an impartial evaluation from an independent auditor that said electronic monitoring is effective in undertaking its designated task. 3. Employers who have established practical necessity for using data from electronic monitoring for tracking and assessing employee performance may not rely solely on such data but must also use other means of assessment such as manager observation or interviewing clients, customers or other employees to solicit feedback. b. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers may use data gathered through electronic monitoring: 1.  To record the beginning or end of a work shift, meal break, or rest break; 2. For non-employment-related purposes; 3. To discharge or discipline an employee in cases of egregious misconduct or involving threats to the health or safety of other persons; or 4.

Notwithstanding subdivision a, when discharging or disciplining employees, employers may rely on electronic employee work speed data to determine whether an employee has met a quota, so long as it measures total output over an increment of time that is no shorter than one day. 2. Employers may not discipline or discharge an employee based on failure to meet a daily quota if the employee did not complete their entire shift. e. 1. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers using electronic monitoring to measure increments of time within a day during which an employee is or is not meeting performance standards  may not record or rely on such data in discharging or disciplining an employee unless it is gathered during a periodic performance review and so long as the employee subject to the performance review has been given at least seven days advance notice of the exact timing of such review. 2. Such reviews can occur not more than once a quarter and can occur for a duration of time not longer than 3 hours. f. An employer or agent thereof that is planning to electronically monitor an employee for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall provide the employee with notice that electronic monitoring will occur prior to conducting each specific form of electronic monitoring. Notice shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: 1. Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to make or inform disciplinary or discharge decisions, and if so, the nature of that decision, including any associated benchmarks or performance standards; 2.

The names of any vendors conducting electronic monitoring on the employer’s behalf; 4. A description of the dates, times, and frequency that electronic monitoring will occur; 5. An explanation for why there is no other practical means of tracking or assessing employee performance and how the specific monitoring practice is the least invasive means available; 6. Notice of the employees’ right to access or correct the data; and 7. Notice of the administrative and judicial mechanisms available to challenge the use of electronic monitoring. g. 1. Notice of the specific form of electronic monitoring shall be clear and conspicuous.

An employer who engages in periodic electronic monitoring of employees for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall inform the affected employees of the specific events which are being monitored at the time the monitoring takes place. 3. Notice of periodic electronic monitoring may be given after electronic monitoring has occurred only if necessary to preserve the integrity of an investigation of illegal activity or protect the immediate safety of employees, customers or the public. 5. An employer shall provide additional notice to employees when an update or change is made to the electronic monitoring or in how the employer is using it. h. Employers shall provide a copy of the disclosures required by this section to the department at the time they are required to be disseminated to employees. § 20-1272.2 Data access and accuracy. a. An employer shall ensure that any data collected through electronic monitoring that may be used for the purposes of discipline or discharge is accurate and, where relevant, kept up to date . b. A current employee shall have the right to request a copy of employee work speed data that may be used for the purposes of discipline and termination at least once every seven days. c. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees the opportunity to supplement that data to record any increments of time during which they are not performing work-related tasks and to record the reason that they are not performing work-related tasks during that time. 2. Such opportunity must be made available to employees both at the time of data collection and after. 3. Employers must give employees the option to record reasons for not performing tasks that include, at a minimum, the following: using the bathroom, taking meal breaks, responding to an emergency, injury, illness, fear of injury, disability, complying with local, state or federal laws or exercising workplace rights under local, state or federal laws. d. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees with the opportunity to review and request correction of such data both at the time of its collection and after. 2. An employer that receives an employee request to correct inaccurate data that collected through electronic monitoring shall investigate and determine whether such data is inaccurate. 3. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that such data is inaccurate, the employer shall: (a) Promptly correct the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the employer’s decision and action. (b) Review and adjust, as appropriate, any disciplinary or discharge decisions that were partially or solely based on the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the adjustment. (c) Inform any third parties with which the employer shared the inaccurate data, or from which the employer received the inaccurate data, and direct them to correct it, and provide the employee with a copy of such action. 4. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that the data is accurate, the employer shall inform the employee of the following: (a) The decision not to amend the data. (b) The steps taken to verify the accuracy of the data and the evidence supporting the decision not to amend the data. § 20-1273 Arbitration. a.  On or after January 1, 2022, any person or organization representing persons alleging a violation of this subchapter by an [a fast food] employer may bring an arbitration proceeding.  In addition, the department may, to the extent permitted by any applicable law including the civil practice law and rules, provide by rule for persons bringing such a proceeding to serve as a representative party on behalf of all members of a class. Such a proceeding must be brought within 2 years of the date of the alleged violation.  If the arbitrator finds that the [fast food] employer violated the provisions of this subchapter, it shall (i) require the [fast food] employer to pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of the [fast food] employee, (ii) require the [fast food] employer to reinstate or restore the hours of the fast food employee, unless the employee waives reinstatement, (iii) require the [fast food] employer to pay the city for the costs of the arbitration proceeding, and (iv) award all other appropriate equitable relief, which may include back pay, rescission of discipline, in addition to other relief, and such other compensatory damages or injunctive relief as may be appropriate. b.

Such arbitration demand must include a general description of each alleged violation but need not reference the precise section alleged to have been violated. c.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, such arbitration shall be subject to the labor arbitration rules established by the American Arbitration Association and the rules promulgated by the department to implement this subchapter. In case of a conflict between the rules of the American Arbitration Association and the rules of the department, the rules of the department shall govern. Any rules promulgated by the department implementing this section shall be consistent with the requirement that in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this section, the arbitrator shall have appropriate qualifications and maintain personal objectivity, and each party shall have the right to present its case, which shall include the right to be in attendance during any presentation made by the other party and the opportunity to rebut or refute such presentation. i.

A civil action under this section shall be commenced within two years of the date the person knew or should have known of the alleged violation. e.   Relationship to department action. 1. Except where the action seeks the imposition of civil penalties, any [Any] person filing a civil action shall simultaneously serve notice of such action and a copy of the complaint upon the department. Failure to so serve a notice does not adversely affect any plaintiff's cause of action. 2.   An employee need not file a complaint with the department pursuant to subdivision b of section 20-1207 before bringing a civil action; however, no person shall file a civil action after filing a complaint with the department unless such complaint has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action. 3.   No person shall file a complaint with the department after filing a civil action unless such action has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action. 4.   The commencement or pendency of a civil action by an employee does not preclude the department from investigating the employer or commencing, prosecuting or settling a case against the employer based on some or all of the same violations. 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing subdivisions, the comptroller or any current or former employer may initiate a public enforcement action seeking to recover civil penalties and injunctive and declaratory relief as a relator on behalf of the department for a violation affecting current or former employees by giving written notice to the department, in such manner as the department may prescribe by rule, of the provisions of this title alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, where a current or former employee is represented by a bona fide labor organization, no organization other than such labor organization may initiate a public enforcement action in relation to any violation by which they were affected. Within 65 calendar days of the postmark date of the notice, the department shall notify the relator if it intends to open an investigation. Within 60 calendar days of that decision, the department may investigate the alleged violation and take any enforcement action authorized by law. If the department determines that additional time is necessary to complete the investigation, it may extend the time by not more than 60 additional calendar days and shall notify the relator of the extension. If the department determines that no enforcement action will be taken, does not respond to the notice, or if no enforcement action is taken by the department within the time limits prescribed, a public enforcement action for civil penalties may be commenced in court. The department may intervene in a public enforcement action for civil penalties brought under this subdivision and proceed with any and all claims in the action as of right within thirty days after the filing of the public enforcement action, or for good cause, as determined by the court, at any time after the thirty-day period after the filing of the public enforcement action. f. Any civil penalties imposed as a result of an enforcement action described in paragraph 5 of this subdivision shall be distributed 65 percent to the department, and 35 percent to the relator to be distributed to the employees affected by the violation, except that if the department intervenes in the action, 75 percent of the penalties shall be distributed to the department and 25 percent to the relator, including a service award that reflects the burdens and risks assumed by the relator in prosecuting the action.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School.

No. 309 Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign S.2832B/A.4558B, the Promote Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act, to ensure judicial review of orders of protection. By Council Members Cabán, Avilés, Gutiérrez, Hanif, Louis, Restler, Hudson and Won Whereas, According to the New York State Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, an order of protection is a court order issued in cases involving domestic violence, requiring one person to do, or not do, certain things if a crime is committed; and Whereas, Orders of protection often require the person charged to stay away from the protected person and children and anywhere they frequent like work or school; and Whereas, A temporary order of protection (TOPs) is issued the same day that a complainant files for an order of protection and lasts only until the next court date, at which point it may be extended; and Whereas, A full order of protection means that the subject of the order of protection must stay completely away from the complainant, their home, job and school, and must not abuse, harass, or threaten them; and. Whereas, A final order of protection is issued when the case results in a conviction (whether by plea or after a trial) in criminal court or in family court after a judge finds that a family offense was committed; and. Whereas, According to the Battered Women Justice Program, orders of protection can be critical to survivor safety, however, orders will not be effective if survivors are not presented with an understandable, just and clear process to obtain an order; and Whereas, According to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), during New York Criminal Court arraignment, judges issue full temporary orders of protection as a matter of course on nearly every case if there is a complainant; and Whereas, Prosecutors ask for TOPs based almost entirely on the representation of law enforcement officers who sometimes act with incomplete information and bias; and Whereas, As a result, TOPs are also issued against survivors of intimate partner violence, with women of color, especially Black women, frequently criminalized even when defending themselves according to NYCLU; and Whereas, According to NYCLU, unnecessary TOPS’s do not make New Yorkers safe, rather, they disfranchise the most marginalized New Yorkers by making housing, employment and education more difficult to obtain; and Whereas, These orders exclude people from their homes and jobs, which has immense consequences for the most marginalized New Yorkers, according to NYCLU; and Whereas, Unlike many other states and the District of Columbia, New York does not have a codified process for accused persons or protected parties to be heard when these ordered are issued; and Whereas, Recognizing this, the New York Appellate Division recently ruled in the matter of Crawford v. Ally (June 24 th , 2021), that when a temporary stay-away order is issued which implicates defendant’s due process rights, the Criminal Court should conduct a “prompt evidentiary hearing,” thereafter; and Whereas, The case bears the name of Shamika Crawford, who was removed from her own New York City Housing Authority apartment by a stay-away order, rendered homeless and separated from her children for nearly three months; and Whereas, A hearing in her case would have offered an opportunity for a judge to examine the facts more closely than they could at arraignment to decide if the order should remain in place, or be limited; and Whereas, However, the Crawford decision leaves numerous details open to interpretation by the courts, and as a result the ruling has been undermined and applied in an inconsistent manner; and Whereas, According to The Bronx Defenders, Ms. Crawford’s experience is a microcosm of the systemic harms that low-income people of color often face when issued a full order of protection in the absence of procedural due process in a way that violates their human right to housing and further perpetuates the poverty and homelessness crisis; and Whereas, S.2832B, introduced by Senator Jessica Ramos, and A.4558B, introduced by Assembly Member Dan Quart, would give the charged parties the right to a hearing to determine whether a full TOP is necessary and appropriate during the pendency of a criminal proceeding; and Whereas, The Promoting Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act codifies Crawford’s holding into law while clarifying key details of hearings; and Whereas, It ensures that due process is complied with and that there is uniform application of the decision across the state; and Whereas, The PromPT Stability Act allows judges to respond to the unique needs of a particular case while also allowing families to work out their differences, and teenagers and young adults to stay in their family’s homes; and Whereas, This legislation will allow judges to make decisions as to the appropriateness of a stay-away order based upon more complete information than they have at arraignment; and Whereas, According to the Human Rights Watch, pretrial reform has made New York’s system fairer by limiting punishment prior to a conviction, allowing people to contest charges against them without the pressure of being in jail and allowing people to keep their jobs and homes, maintain family connections, and access health care while contesting accusations against them; and Whereas, We must continue the fight to reinforce one of the most basic tenets of justice to ensure that everyone is given the right to a prompt evidentiary hearing so courts will not impose punishments without first reviewing evidence; now, therefore, be it; Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign S.2832B/A.4558B, the Promote Pre-Trial (PromPT) Stability Act, and ensure judicial review of orders of protection.

She is the daughter of Dr. Lynne Richardson and Dr. Desmond Jordan, two minority physicians who trained at the historic Harlem Hospital.  Her father, Dr. Desmond A. Jordan, just passed this past November 2020. He is deeply missed.  Growing up Kristin (KRJ) was in and out of Lenox Terrace where her great aunt was an original tenant and where Kristin herself lives now. She attended the Calhoun School where she graduated cum laude with distinction in Social Studies, Spanish, Mathematics, Science, and Music. She then attended Brown University where she graduated class of 2009 as a double major in in Black Studies (“Africana”) and Literary Arts and was a commencement speaker for the Africana Studies department.  Kristin (KRJ) is a book printing poet, teaching artist, author, and activist in the Harlem community, where her mother is also from and lives, where her great aunt (as mentioned above) was from and lived, and where her grandparents (married at Abyssinia Baptist Church) lived – 3 generations of Harlem.  Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has published her own (and others) work by starting an independent publishing company called Pens Up Press, for literary activists generally, and Black and Latino activists in particular to publish and promote books for and about making a better world. Kristin’s first book titled Mules Fight Back: 40 Activist Poems and Stories is a poetic response to the famous Zora Neale Hurston reference that the Black woman is the “mule of the world,” and her most recent work, Water & Light: Choose Love Now, rooted in her personal experience with an abusive relationship is about a totality of things from personal, interpersonal, romantic, platonic, social, communal to national revolution. In addition to her own work and publishing, Kristin also coordinates the Uproar Poetry Group, an online Facebook platform for activist poets, and (until recently with the COVID pandemic) ran senior poems and senior current events workshops at A. Phillip Randolph Senior Center and Central Harlem Senior Center. She and her team continue to serve seniors and ALL Harlem residents with daily wellness checks and mutual aid.  As an activist Kristin has participated in the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street mass movements. She’s been a member of the ANSWER coalition (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), a supporter of Freedom Hall and Sister’s Uptown Bookstore in Harlem, and a member of AALUSC (African Ancestrial Lesbians United for Societal Change). In 2012 Kristin founded a cop watch team and has continued to this day to be an advocate for police accountability. She is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, a member of LT-ACT (Lenox Terrace Tenants Association), and the Social Justice Chair for United Methodist Women at Salem Church. Kristin is also a practicing Buddhist (Christian Buddhist) and member of Soka Gakkai International (SGI). Some opponents with ties to the establishment claim they have “never seen Kristin” because of her lack of ties to Harlem’s political machine, but anyone active in Harlem community service and anyone out in the streets with the protests last summer and for years before knows Kristin, KRJ, Kristin for Harlem.  As a teacher and a teaching artist KRJ has worked for a number of notable organizations including Directions For Our Youth and Girl Be Heard; and until recently was a literacy specialist at Harlem Boys & Girls Club. She was also the co-founder of Freedom Love Birthright a writing and community theatre youth program in the spirit of African and African-American ancestry that took place in 2019 in Central Harlem.  As a public speaker, panelist, and guest lecturer, Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has presented at Circle of Voices, the Kennedy Center, Hostos Community College, and Montclair State University. She has also been featured on a number of podcasts including Mind Over Melanin.  Kristin is passionate about social justice, and the history, politics, and culture(s) of all people generally and Black people in particular. Politically spiritually and personally she believes in serving people including but not limited to housing, environment, health, food, education, and criminal/policing justice. She is an optimist and an idealist who dreams about a truly equal and equitable world based on seeing whole people and the humanity in every person.

Last name: Hanif E-mail: District39@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/ Notes: District 39 - Council Member - Democrat - Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Waterfront, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington - Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard.

Last name: Last name: Hanif Hanif E-mail: E-mail: District39@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/ Notes: Notes: District 39 - Council Member - Democrat - Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Waterfront, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington - Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.

At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

Last name: Stevens E-mail: District16@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-16/ Notes: District 16 - Council Member - Democrat - Althea Stevens is a proud New York native and a respected community advocate for the Bronx. As a dedicated single teen mother, she works hard to create a sustainable future for her child and for all children and families who live in under-resourced neighborhoods.  Althea began her career in civic service more than 15 years ago working for non-profit agencies and community centers that focused on giving a voice to the most vulnerable populations. She organized voting rights information sessions, led strategy workshops to address gang policing and created annual youth forums and community celebrations to bridge relationships between residents and neighborhood partners. Each step of the way, Althea’s natural leadership and organizing skills were honed while advocating for families, seniors, young adults and students on important issues, while identifying and allocating much needed resources to neighborhoods of the Bronx.  Althea will continue her life’s work – of motivating and inspiring, leading with passion and advocating for the community – as a proud member of the City Council representing the great residents of City Council District 16.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.  Lincoln grew up in Brooklyn Heights and lives in Greenpoint with his partner. He graduated from Brown University and attended neighborhood schools.

No. 111 Resolution calling on New York State to pass legislation that would provide domestic violence survivors and their families with job-protected, paid leave, similar to that of New York State’s Paid Family Leave law, to be used for any activities relating to their actual or perceived status as a domestic violence survivor or family member of a domestic violence survivor. By Council Member Cabán, the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Stevens, Hanif, Won, Restler, Krishnan, Abreu, Hudson, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Narcisse, Ung, Menin, Lee, Williams, De La Rosa, Richardson Jordan, Avilés, Schulman, Brewer, Sanchez, Farías, Riley, Ayala, Gennaro, Louis, Velázquez, Kagan and Rivera Whereas, In 2018, the New York State (NYS) Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence reported that domestic violence and sexual violence hotlines throughout NYS received 341,909 calls, including 81,062 from New York City (NYC), with approximately 5,244 hospital inpatient discharges and Emergency Department visits statewide identified as domestic violence -related events, an 84% increase as compared to similar data in 2017; and Whereas, From 2010 to 2018, in NYC there were 558 domestic violence homicide incidents, with 55 occurring in 2018, according to the NYC Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee; and Whereas, Although domestic violence is highly prevalent in society, as evidenced by NYS and NYC statistics, many domestic violence survivors and their families are not provided with adequate paid time off to tend to their complex situations, often seeing their employment being drastically impacted; and Whereas, For example, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research’s 2018 survey on the impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) indicates that 83% of respondents reported that their abusive partners disrupted their ability to work, with those respondents reporting that: 70% were not able to have a job when they wanted or needed one; 53% lost a job because of abuse; 49% missed one or more days of work and 18% missed out on a promotion or raise; and Whereas, In addition, data from the National Violence Against Women Survey published by the Centers for Disease Control estimated that women victims of IPV lose a total of nearly eight million days of paid work annually as a result of IPV; and Whereas, In 2016, NYS Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law Paid Family Leave (PFL), with its official launch in 2018, providing eligible employees paid time off to: bond with a newly born, adopted or fostered child; care for a family member with a serious health condition; or assist loved ones when a spouse, domestic partner, child or parent is deployed abroad on active military service, while also including job protection, continued health insurance and protection from discrimination or retaliation; and Whereas, NYS’ PFL is funded by employee payroll deductions and offers its benefits through a four-year phase-in period, with phase one (2018) providing employees with eight weeks of PFL at 50% of their average weekly wage (AWW), capped at up to 50% of the Statewide Average Weekly Wage (SAWW), and phase four (2021), with employees receiving 12 weeks of PFL at 67% of their AWW, capped at up to 67% of SAWW; and Whereas, In an effort to help domestic violence survivors and their families, NYC passed the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act in 2017, requiring employers to provide employees who are victims of family offense matters, sexual offenses, stalking and human trafficking, and their family members, with up to 40 hours per calendar year of paid leave or unpaid leave, depending on employer size, to take time off to restore their physical, psychological and economic health or that of a family member; and Whereas, Although NYC’s law is beneficial, domestic violence survivors and their families may require a longer leave period and the assurance of paid leave, similar to the benefits provided by NYS’ PFL; and Whereas, Because NYS’ PFL is funded by employee deductions, employers do not bear the cost of providing these benefits to their employees; and Whereas, Providing domestic violence survivors and their families with job-protected, paid leave, similar to that of NYS’ PFL, would ensure that domestic violence survivors and their families properly heal from the abuse they have endured and receive the financial support, job-protection and protection from discrimination or retaliation that they require to deal with their complex situations, while also ensuring that the cost of such benefit does not fall on employers; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on New York State to pass legislation that would provide domestic violence survivors and their families with job-protected, paid leave, similar to that of New York State’s Paid Family Leave law, to be used for any activities relating to their actual or perceived status as a domestic violence survivor or family member of a domestic violence survivor.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers.

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses.

Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.  As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.  For many years, Gale Brewer has taught at CUNY and Barnard College.  Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College. She lives with her husband Cal Snyder, and they have a grown son. In the past, she had many foster children.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all. District 34 - Council Member - Democrat - Williamsburg, Bushwick, Ridgewood - Jennifer Gutiérrez is an organizer, activist, and ally. For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother. For nearly a decade, Sandy has been working in Bushwick and supporting projects in East New York that empower women and young people of color. Most of her work has been dedicated to ending white supremacy, fighting for a transition away from the fossil fuel economy, and demanding our public agencies and servants are accountable to the people, not corporations.  Through years of strong community partnerships and collaborations, Sandy has built neighborhood institutions that directly strengthen grassroots movements in Bushwick and East New York. She has committed her life to addressing issues through direct interventions and solutions including building farms in our food deserts, creating jobs where we have high unemployment, and helping develop community space where it was scarce.  As the new City Council Member, she will fight to keep people in their homes, create protections for our immigrant neighbors, and help to build a healthy, sustainable future.

Amanda is a lifelong Bronxite, born and raised in Soundview as a second-generation Afro-Latina of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent. She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours learning to dance and summers at camp in Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. Soon after graduate school, she started her career by fighting voter suppression and mobilizing Black and Latino communities for President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus and a districtwide Participatory Budgeting process. After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx. Amanda’s programming and partnerships with CUNY, labor unions, and local community-based organizations have allowed her to create new opportunities for young Bronxites to access trade jobs. During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Amanda created a pipeline for more women to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.  During the height of the pandemic Amanda became active in mutual aid and feels most in her element when in community. Hosting food distributions for neighbors has been at the core of her service to continue the fight against food insecurity and The Bronx being the unhealthiest county in NYS.  She was elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021. Amanda currently resides in Parkchester with her dog and cat.

The safe, healthy New York City we all need and deserve will recognize that being homeless isn’t a crime. Read The Bill NYC Sex Worker Protection Bill Sex work is work. The city has a responsibility to protect the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of all New Yorkers, regardless of what they do for a living. Read The Bill Passed Into Law Cecilia Gentili Day Cecilia Gentili was a fearless leader, a trans icon, an author, an actress, a pioneering advocate for the dignity and freedom of sex workers, and so much more. The New York City Council passed my resolution to designate January 31 as Cecilia Gentili Day annually. Cecilia Day is proof that New York City will continue to celebrate the joy and power of the transgender community. Read Coverage Support Survivors For too long, this city has cynically used violence survivors trauma and pain merely as a pretext to ramp up policing, prosecution, and incarceration, leaving the actual survivors without access to the services and protections they need. No longer. Read Coverage Safe City for Abortion Care As we fight for the  guaranteed right to a free, safe, legal abortion for anyone who determines that they need one, this legislative package ensures that NYC is safe for anyone receiving, performing, or assisting in abortion care. Read Coverage From Shelters Into Homes Too many can’t afford rent if their housing voucher has to cover utilities too. This law eliminates that obstacle, helping our homeless neighbors move more efficiently from the shelter system into the permanent housing they need and deserve.

Photo by Dean Moses Elected officials joined backers of the “Care for All Families” campaign in City Hall Park Tuesday to demand funding for all children, especially undocumented immigrants to be included in the City’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget. New York State legislators expanded childcare in the state budget last month; however, New York City elected officials lambasted Albany for leaving behind what they say is an essential group—undocumented immigrants.  Private early childcare in New York City can cost astronomical amounts of money, and those living paycheck to paycheck are left to choose between family care and work. Comptroller Brad Lander rallied on May 31 around Council Members Tiffany Cabán and Shahana Hanif, along with members of Make the Road NY and NICE to demand the city invest $10 million in order to provide childcare for undocumented families. This is something Cabán says is easily obtainable and comes at the cost of roughly 0.01% of the city’s total budget. Close Get amNY in your inbox! News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up Comptroller Brad Lander. Photo by Dean Moses Photo by Dean Moses “If there was any question before the pandemic, it is certainly undeniable now that undocumented New Yorkers keep this city running,” Cabán said. “Since we rely on the labor of our undocumented neighbors to stay afloat, we have a moral and economic obligation to guarantee them the same publicly-subsidized childcare other New York families are entitled to. A commitment to true public safety must include a commitment to meeting families’ needs so they aren’t stressed to the breaking point, and meeting children’s needs so they grow up healthy, connected, and secure.” Advocates argue that no child should be left behind, yet currently, they say children of undocumented immigrants will be at a disadvantage in life without access to early childhood programs. If allocated, the funds would make city-run early childhood education and care vouchers available to children currently ineligible due to their immigration status while also ensuring that DOE-contracted programs accept city-funded vouchers. Photo by Dean Moses “Our city offers all school-age children regardless of immigration status a public education because providing an education to all has enormous benefits to children, families, and our city. Those benefits shouldn’t just begin when a child enrolls in school; they should begin at birth. Our city should engage our youngest learners and ensure that working families have access to high-quality care regardless of immigration status. When we build a city where no one is excluded from obtaining care, where workers can support their families without worry—that is when everyone can thrive,” Comptroller Lander said.

A commitment to true public safety must include a commitment to meeting families’ needs so they aren’t stressed to the breaking point, and meeting children’s needs so they grow up healthy, connected, and secure.” Advocates argue that no child should be left behind, yet currently, they say children of undocumented immigrants will be at a disadvantage in life without access to early childhood programs. If allocated, the funds would make city-run early childhood education and care vouchers available to children currently ineligible due to their immigration status while also ensuring that DOE-contracted programs accept city-funded vouchers. Photo by Dean Moses “Our city offers all school-age children regardless of immigration status a public education because providing an education to all has enormous benefits to children, families, and our city. Those benefits shouldn’t just begin when a child enrolls in school; they should begin at birth. Our city should engage our youngest learners and ensure that working families have access to high-quality care regardless of immigration status. When we build a city where no one is excluded from obtaining care, where workers can support their families without worry—that is when everyone can thrive,” Comptroller Lander said.

Wade last month, members of the first women-majority New York City Council began crafting their response. They wanted to safeguard abortion access and bolster reproductive health care in the city as protests and legal battles kicked off across the country Around three weeks later, that response will largely be voted on Thursday in the Committee on Women and Gender Equity and then the full City Council. On the docket are bills that would take a holistic approach to expanding abortion access, including measures that would require some city health clinics to provide free abortion pills, allow civil lawsuits against operations or individuals that interfere with reproductive or endocrine medical care, and bar city agencies from using city resources to enforce other states’ abortion restrictions. Related articles Pat Ryan runs an abortion ad, hoping to make reproductive rights a focus in the NY-19 special election New York lawmakers rage in wake of Supreme Court’s ‘abhorrent’ reversal of Roe v. Wade These are the types of steps that blue cities and states must take to ensure equitable access to abortion and other forms of reproductive care – especially in areas that border states where abortion is now banned,  according to Council Member Carlina Rivera, who is sponsoring several of the measures in the “NYC Abortion Rights Act” legislative package. “Women across the United States are desperately searching for abortion care, and tens of millions are living in fear over concerted Republican efforts to further roll back our rights,” Rivera said. “We need to fight like hell to secure safe, legal and easily accessible abortion for everyone.” Rivera’s legislation would require all Department of Health and Mental Hygiene clinics to provide medication abortion for free regardless of a person’s immigration status or health insurance. While providing this medication is likely to be costly, she said the investment would be worth it. “People are going to come to New York City,” Rivera said. “We know that people will come here, and the focus is really to serve low-income women and people whose abortions are not covered by their health care.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán, who is also sponsoring several measures in the package, said it's no coincidence that the City Council is tackling the overturning of Roe v. Wade with such urgency. With the latest election, the New York City Council is composed of 31 women members, making the majority for the first time in history. And with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams at the helm, it's also being led by a woman. Many of these council members have said they see the new session as an opportunity to ramp up the attention on pay disparities, the maternal mortality crisis and of course abortion and reproductive health care – issues that Cabán said have long been a blind spot for many cisgender men serving in political positions. “There’s an accounting for and a base of knowledge that is deeply personal, and then there’s momentum and power behind it because there’s so many folks that are sharing some sort of overlapping experience around that,” Cabán said. “We are seeing, I think for the first time in our council, lots more legislation that has to do with child care – legislative interventions and solutions that will make a difference in the day-to-day lives of expectant parents. That is because we have mothers and caretakers in the halls of power.” One of Cabán’s measures would require the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to issue an annual report on the number of births and abortions that occur in the city for both New York City residents and those who come from out of state. This effort, she said, would help assess the city’s capacity to accommodate the increased demands. Also up for consideration Thursday is legislation that would empower countersuits in cases where a person who comes to New York to receive an abortion is sued because accessing one is illegal in their home state. “This reinstates that in our city and our state these kinds of illegal actions that an abusive ex partner might take is an interference with medical care,” Council Member Shahana Hanif said, the bill’s sponsor. Having passed out of committee Wednesday, her other bill would require the city to conduct a robust public information campaign to inform New Yorkers about their reproductive rights – especially for those who face additional barriers such as lower income folks, those with limited English proficiency, and women of color. Policy leaders at the New York Civil Liberties Union say the City Council’s package comes as half the country strives to ban abortion within their own states’ borders and even impede access in places where abortion remains legal. They said the council’s legislation is a promising first step, but more efforts remain to be taken to expand “meaningful access” to reproductive health care. Still, according to NYCLU policy counsel Allie Bohm, Thursday’s efforts are at their heart, reminiscent of those taken in 1970 when New York legalized abortion – three years before Roe v. Wade. “At that time we put up bilboards on the borders saying that abortion was safe, legal and available here,” Bohm said. “We are called upon to do the digital age equivalent of that these days and to really make it accessible and affordable for everybody.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Elijah Muhammad was kept in isolated unit on Rikers for over 30 hours days before his death, board member says Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Policy New York City’s first women-majority council to take on abortion access The City Council will consider bills to allow people to sue for abortion interference and prohibit city resources for enforcement of other states’ restrictions among other actions.

In determining whether [a fast food] an employee has been discharged for just cause, the fact-finder shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors, whether: 1. The [fast food] employee knew or should have known of the [fast food] employer’s policy, rule , [or] practice or performance standard that is the basis for progressive discipline or discharge; 2. The [fast food] employer provided relevant and adequate training to the [fast food] employee; 3.

In determining whether an [a fast food] employer had just cause for discharge, the fact-finder may not consider any reasons proffered by the [fast food] employer but not included in such written explanation provided to the [fast food] employee. 4. Where an employer fails to timely provide a written explanation to an employee, the discharge shall not be deemed to be based on just cause. e. The [fast food] employer shall bear the burden of proving just cause or a bona fide economic reason by a preponderance of the evidence in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subchapter, subject to the rules of evidence as set forth in the civil practice law and rules or, where applicable, the common law. f.

Electronic monitoring. a. 1. Employers may not rely on data collected through electronic monitoring in discharging or disciplining an employee unless the employer can establish before each use that (i) there is no other practical means of tracking or assessing employee performance; (ii) the employer is using the least invasive form of electronic monitoring available; and (iii) the employer previously provided notice to the employee of that monitoring as required by this section. 2.   Employers cannot establish the practical necessity for electronic monitoring without previously filing with the department an impartial evaluation from an independent auditor that said electronic monitoring is effective in undertaking its designated task. 3. Employers who have established practical necessity for using data from electronic monitoring for tracking and assessing employee performance may not rely solely on such data but must also use other means of assessment such as manager observation or interviewing clients, customers or other employees to solicit feedback. b. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers may use data gathered through electronic monitoring: 1.  To record the beginning or end of a work shift, meal break, or rest break; 2. For non-employment-related purposes; 3. To discharge or discipline an employee in cases of egregious misconduct or involving threats to the health or safety of other persons; or 4. Where required by state or federal law. c. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers may not use data for discipline or discharge if such data is gathered using biometric technologies, video or audio recordings within the private home of an employee, apps or software installed on personal devices or geofencing technologies. d. 1. Notwithstanding subdivision a, when discharging or disciplining employees, employers may rely on electronic employee work speed data to determine whether an employee has met a quota, so long as it measures total output over an increment of time that is no shorter than one day. 2. Employers may not discipline or discharge an employee based on failure to meet a daily quota if the employee did not complete their entire shift. e. 1. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers using electronic monitoring to measure increments of time within a day during which an employee is or is not meeting performance standards  may not record or rely on such data in discharging or disciplining an employee unless it is gathered during a periodic performance review and so long as the employee subject to the performance review has been given at least seven days advance notice of the exact timing of such review. 2. Such reviews can occur not more than once a quarter and can occur for a duration of time not longer than 3 hours. f. An employer or agent thereof that is planning to electronically monitor an employee for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall provide the employee with notice that electronic monitoring will occur prior to conducting each specific form of electronic monitoring. Notice shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: 1. Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to make or inform disciplinary or discharge decisions, and if so, the nature of that decision, including any associated benchmarks or performance standards; 2. Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to assess employees’ productivity performance or to set productivity standards, and if so, how; 3. The names of any vendors conducting electronic monitoring on the employer’s behalf; 4. A description of the dates, times, and frequency that electronic monitoring will occur; 5. An explanation for why there is no other practical means of tracking or assessing employee performance and how the specific monitoring practice is the least invasive means available; 6. Notice of the employees’ right to access or correct the data; and 7. Notice of the administrative and judicial mechanisms available to challenge the use of electronic monitoring. g. 1. Notice of the specific form of electronic monitoring shall be clear and conspicuous. A notice that states electronic monitoring “may” take place or that the employer “reserves the right” to monitor shall not be considered clear and conspicuous. 2. An employer who engages in periodic electronic monitoring of employees for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall inform the affected employees of the specific events which are being monitored at the time the monitoring takes place. 3. Notice of periodic electronic monitoring may be given after electronic monitoring has occurred only if necessary to preserve the integrity of an investigation of illegal activity or protect the immediate safety of employees, customers or the public. 5. An employer shall provide additional notice to employees when an update or change is made to the electronic monitoring or in how the employer is using it. h. Employers shall provide a copy of the disclosures required by this section to the department at the time they are required to be disseminated to employees. § 20-1272.2 Data access and accuracy. a. An employer shall ensure that any data collected through electronic monitoring that may be used for the purposes of discipline or discharge is accurate and, where relevant, kept up to date . b. A current employee shall have the right to request a copy of employee work speed data that may be used for the purposes of discipline and termination at least once every seven days. c. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees the opportunity to supplement that data to record any increments of time during which they are not performing work-related tasks and to record the reason that they are not performing work-related tasks during that time. 2. Such opportunity must be made available to employees both at the time of data collection and after. 3. Employers must give employees the option to record reasons for not performing tasks that include, at a minimum, the following: using the bathroom, taking meal breaks, responding to an emergency, injury, illness, fear of injury, disability, complying with local, state or federal laws or exercising workplace rights under local, state or federal laws. d. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees with the opportunity to review and request correction of such data both at the time of its collection and after. 2. An employer that receives an employee request to correct inaccurate data that collected through electronic monitoring shall investigate and determine whether such data is inaccurate. 3. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that such data is inaccurate, the employer shall: (a) Promptly correct the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the employer’s decision and action. (b) Review and adjust, as appropriate, any disciplinary or discharge decisions that were partially or solely based on the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the adjustment. (c) Inform any third parties with which the employer shared the inaccurate data, or from which the employer received the inaccurate data, and direct them to correct it, and provide the employee with a copy of such action. 4. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that the data is accurate, the employer shall inform the employee of the following: (a) The decision not to amend the data. (b) The steps taken to verify the accuracy of the data and the evidence supporting the decision not to amend the data. § 20-1273 Arbitration. a.  On or after January 1, 2022, any person or organization representing persons alleging a violation of this subchapter by an [a fast food] employer may bring an arbitration proceeding.  In addition, the department may, to the extent permitted by any applicable law including the civil practice law and rules, provide by rule for persons bringing such a proceeding to serve as a representative party on behalf of all members of a class. Such a proceeding must be brought within 2 years of the date of the alleged violation.  If the arbitrator finds that the [fast food] employer violated the provisions of this subchapter, it shall (i) require the [fast food] employer to pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of the [fast food] employee, (ii) require the [fast food] employer to reinstate or restore the hours of the fast food employee, unless the employee waives reinstatement, (iii) require the [fast food] employer to pay the city for the costs of the arbitration proceeding, and (iv) award all other appropriate equitable relief, which may include back pay, rescission of discipline, in addition to other relief, and such other compensatory damages or injunctive relief as may be appropriate. b. A person or organization bringing an arbitration proceeding under subdivision a must serve the arbitration demand, and any amendments thereto, on the [fast food] employer either in person or via certified mail at the current or most recent [fast food establishment] workplace or job site where each [fast food] employee named in the arbitration demand is or was employed, or pursuant to the rules for service specified in article 3 of the civil practice law and rules. Such arbitration demand must include a general description of each alleged violation but need not reference the precise section alleged to have been violated. c. The parties to an arbitration proceeding shall jointly select the arbitrator from a panel of arbitrators. The number of arbitrators on the panel shall be determined by the department. The arbitrators on the panel shall be chosen by a committee of eight participants established by the department and comprised of: 1. Four employee-side representatives, including [fast food] employees or advocates; and 2. Four employer-side representatives, including [fast food] employers or advocates. d. If an insufficient number of employee-side and employer-side representatives agree to participate in the committee pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the department shall consult with those that have agreed to participate and select individuals to fill the requisite number of openings on the committee. e. If the committee established pursuant to subdivision c of this section is unable to select a sufficient number of arbitrators for the panel as determined by the department, the department shall select the remaining arbitrators. f. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the department shall select an arbitrator from the panel. g. The department shall provide interpretation services to any party requiring such services for the arbitration hearing. h. The arbitration hearing shall be held at a location designated by the department or a location agreed to by the parties and the arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, such arbitration shall be subject to the labor arbitration rules established by the American Arbitration Association and the rules promulgated by the department to implement this subchapter. In case of a conflict between the rules of the American Arbitration Association and the rules of the department, the rules of the department shall govern. Any rules promulgated by the department implementing this section shall be consistent with the requirement that in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this section, the arbitrator shall have appropriate qualifications and maintain personal objectivity, and each party shall have the right to present its case, which shall include the right to be in attendance during any presentation made by the other party and the opportunity to rebut or refute such presentation. i. If an [a fast food] employee brings an arbitration proceeding, arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there shall be no right to bring or continue a private cause of action or administrative complaint under this subchapter, unless such arbitration proceeding has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice. j. Each party shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the confirmation, modification or vacatur of an award pursuant to article 75 of the civil practice law and rules, as such article applies, pursuant to applicable case law, to review of legally mandated arbitration proceedings in accordance with standards of due process. § 20-1274 Applicability of schedule change premiums.

But the Council has pushed back consistently, disputing the mayor’s cost estimate and accusing him of shortsightedness. Gerardo Romo / NYC Council Media Unit Councilmember Pierina Sanchez speaks at a rally in support of CityFHEPS expansion ahead of the council’s veto. Weeks of mounting tension between Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council came to a head Thursday, as the Council voted 42-8 to override his recent veto of bills aimed at expanding eligibility for city-issued rental vouchers. The mayor has argued that the bills will be too costly, and that an expanded pool will make it harder for existing voucher holders in a city with too few low-cost apartments. A legal challenge to today’s veto override could be imminent. But the Council has pushed back consistently, disputing the mayor’s cost estimate and accusing him of shortsightedness. “We are trying to relieve pressure on our shelter system,” Bronx Councilmember Pierina Sanchez, a primary sponsor of the package, said at a rally outside City Hall Thursday. While more housing supply is needed, she said, “you can walk and chew gum.” The override comes as a record number of people are sleeping in Department of Homeless Services shelters*— nearly 82,000 as of Tuesday , with tens of thousands more in emergency facilities set up to house asylum seekers. The bills, which initially passed in May, will eliminate several existing qualifications to access City Family Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement, or CityFHEPS, vouchers. Under the program, established in 2018, most voucher holders pay part of their income in rent, while the city covers the balance. Income eligibility will jump from 200 percent of the federal poverty level to 50 percent of the area median income under the legislation, or $63,550 for a family of three. Work requirements will also be eliminated, and New Yorkers will be able to access the vouchers in a wider range of shelter systems, including those for youth. Under current rules, New Yorkers who are not in shelter have to meet strict qualifications to access CityFHEPS. But one of the bills revived today will expand voucher eligibility to any income-qualifying household “at risk of eviction,” demonstrated with a rent demand letter—a notice signaling the impending start of an eviction case. “It’s all about keeping folks in their homes,” sponsor Sanchez said ahead of the override. The bills also codify the elimination of a 90-day waiting period for New Yorkers to qualify for CityFHEPs after entering shelter. Mayor Adams eliminated the requirement through an emergency rule in June, while also tweaking work requirements that the Council bills strike down. Moving to veto the Council’s package on June 23, Mayor Adams said it goes too far and that “the option to provide vouchers to every person who would be eligible under the Council’s bills is far beyond what the city can provide.” Cost estimates vary. The Adams Administration has estimated a $17.2 billion price tag over five years, factoring in shelter savings and based on an assumed 47,000 new voucher holders each year. The City Council’s estimate hovers at $10.6 billion. In a June analysis, the Community Service Society of New York (a City Limits funder) predicted a much lower net cost of $3 billion over five years, factoring in estimated shelter savings as well as the the cost differential between the apartments low-income tenants are fighting to hold onto and more expensive apartments on the open market. At a press conference preceding the veto override, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams described other costs if the Council bills were to flounder. “There are also the educational, health, justice system, and other costs that are created when people become, and remain homeless,” she said. Thursday marked the first veto override since Michael Bloomberg’s mayoralty, when bills were vetoed, and subsequently overridden, with some frequency. By contrast,  former Mayor Bill de Blasio did not veto a single bill. During his veto announcement last month, Mayor Adams hinted at a possible legal challenge if the Council were to override his action, saying the legislation “clearly exceeds the Council’s legal authority.” Elaborating on this position this week, City Hall sources said the bills impede on state authority, since rental assistance programs are governed by the state’s Social Services Law, which doesn’t empower the City Council to administer them. Mayor Adams would not be the first mayor to use such an argument to challenge a veto override, according to Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University. In 2006, for example, the New York State Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, ruled in favor of then-Mayor Bloomberg, finding that he did not have to enforce a law extending certain benefits to domestic partners because it violated state and federal law. “The Council is on thin legal ground,” Moss said. But the City Council dismissed the legal threat on Wednesday, in a lengthy press release annotating the mayor’s recent Daily News op-ed on the voucher bills line by line. “The Council has previously legislated several times on the CityFHEPS voucher program,” the release noted, including in 2021, when the city increased the value of the vouchers to better keep pace with rising housing costs. “I would offer that the CityFHEPS program is completely city-administered with city funds,” said Robert Desir, an attorney with the civil reform unit at the Legal Aid Society and proponent of the CityFHEPS bills. “And obviously the City Council has a role, they’ve played a role, and I think that they’re on solid footing.” Asked about a possible court battle ahead of Thursday’s vote, Speaker Adams said she hadn’t had any discussions about it. “I’ve had no conversation, candidly, of that, so that’s something that I can’t even address,” she said. Regardless, the legislation revived Thursday comes with a six month implementation period, meaning the bills won’t take full effect immediately. Both critics and supporters have noted that the city agencies tasked with processing vouchers are short-staffed , and the current volume of vouchers is not being processed smoothly. “The city has to attack the delays associated with CityFHEPS,” Desir of Legal Aid said during a General Welfare Committee hearing Thursday, speaking in support of the veto override. “Voucher holders should not have to navigate a byzantine lease-up process where weeks or months of delays often lead to loss of housing opportunity.” In a statement, a spokesperson for the Council turned the spotlight on the Adams Administration to address its staffing shortages, saying increasing and sustaining staffing is “the responsibility of every mayoral administration.” “Rather than justifying dysfunction or setting low expectations for our city agencies,” they added, “people criticizing solutions to homelessness should focus their attention on promoting more support for agencies to have the capacity they need.” *This story has been updated to clarify the shelter census is DHS-specific.

It’s been nearly a year since the sudden passing of Cecilia Gentili, the trans activist and New York icon who, among other accomplishments, helped to repeal the state’s “Walking While Trans” law. Now, thanks to a resolution spearheaded by City Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán , the City has officially recognized January 31—Gentili’s birthday—as Cecilia Gentili Day. The honor is well-earned. In her lifetime, Argentinian-born Gentili was known as a uniting, nurturing force in New York’s trans community, one whose tireless advocacy for trans causes made the city a safer place for sex workers. A performer by trade, Gentili played a key role in lobbying for trans rights at the state level. Her activism helped to bring us the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA), which established gender identity as a protected category under New York State’s Civil Rights Act. Through her advocacy group Decrim NY, Gentili was instrumental in the bid to overturn New York’s “Walking While Trans” law, an anti-sex work statute that activists say disproportionately targeted trans women. Gentili was also pivotal in making—and keeping—gender-affirming healthcare accessible to trans young people across the city. In 2021, she established the COIN Clinic at the Callen-Lorde healthcare center to ensure trans sex workers had access to free healthcare, and she helped to expand the reach of Apicha Community Health Center, bringing almost 500 trans people through its doors. Cecilia Gentili’s storied legacy means she’s remembered fondly not just by her many chosen children—including the artist Rio Sofía, who spoke to City Council about her mother’s contributions to the city—but by thousands of queer and trans New Yorkers. This year, Cecilia’s children were joined by loved ones and strangers alike for a celebration of her life at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, where those who knew Cecila honored her through speeches and performance tributes. The celebration was reminiscent of Gentili’s February 2024 memorial service, a raucous, fashion-forward affair at St. Patrick’s Cathedral that brought together more than 1,400 people from across New York’s LGBTQ+ communities, including artists, writers, and activists like Billy Porter, Sara Ramirez, and Indya Moore. Honoring Gentili feels more important now than ever, as trans and immigrant New Yorkers are once again fighting to hold onto their hard-won rights. As the Trump Administration attempts to eradicate trans healthcare , roll back legal protections for the LGBTQ+ community , and antagonize immigrant communities through deportations and fearmongering , we’re reminded of the strength of Gentili’s enduring commitment to making the city a safe haven for trans people of all ages and backgrounds. Speaking to the City Council about her mother’s legacy, Río Sofía said, “I want us to remember every January 31st that what Cecilia was fighting for was not about recognition. It was about trans liberation, liberation for immigrants, for sex workers, and I want us to carry forth that legacy.” Trans Icon Cecilia Gentili Officially Recognized By New York City February 4, 2025 Paulina Rodriguez New York’s City Council has officially named January 31 “Cecilia Gentili Day” in honor of the late trans activist’s birthday.

It was about trans liberation, liberation for immigrants, for sex workers, and I want us to carry forth that legacy.” Share on Facebook Share on X Share on Reddit Pin on Pinterest Toggle share menu Recommends Sign up to receive GO 's weekly newsletter!

John McCarten/NYC Council Media Unit Queens Councilmember Tiffany Cabán introduced the legislation and rallied for its passage outside City Hall Thursday. Survivors of domestic violence in New York City will soon have access to modest emergency grants that will help cover the cost of housing and other needs under a new measure passed by the Council Thursday. The legislation, introduced by Queens Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, directs the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-based Violence (ENDGBV) and the Department of Social Services (DSS) to establish the fund and dispense modest grants to qualifying families and individuals, like New Yorkers who have stayed in domestic violence shelters or sought services through the city’s Family Justice Centers. The exact amount of the proposed fund and the maximum total of each grant will likely be determined ahead of the city’s budgeting process next year, but a pilot program introduced by ENDGBV early in the COVID pandemic offered 377 “microgrants” averaging $1,243.37 from June 2020 to May 2021, according to an evaluation . All told, the program dispensed about $470,000 that year. Cabán said the bill, part of a legislative package intended to support domestic violence survivors, is the “first program of its kind” and builds on the ENDGBV initiative. She said the legislation is inspired by a 2019 report issued by then-City Comptroller Scott Stringer, which found that domestic violence was the leading cause of family homelessness and urged the city to create a “survivor housing stability fund” to meet immediate rental assistance and rehousing needs. READ MORE: Hundreds of Families Forced from Domestic Violence Shelters into Strained DHS System Each Year “Being able to materially support survivors immediately in the moment of most acute need, we can’t stress how important that is,” Cabán told City Limits Wednesday. “Part of being independent is having the resources you need around you.” The ENDGBV pilot program evaluation determined the initiative faced challenges, including sifting through more applications than expected, but met “the acute and unique needs of survivors of domestic and gender-based violence in New York City.” Forty percent of service providers who administered the grants said the program helped clients remain stably housed or covered rent, while 48 percent of recipients reported feeling safer after receiving the modest sums, the 2021 report added. “This will materially make them and our city safer from violence,” Cabán said. Last year, New York City’s five Family Justice Centers—one in each borough—served 13,272 individual clients, with Queens accounting for about a third of that total, according to a Council committee report on the grant legislation. The centers provide safety planning, legal services and other programs for survivors of domestic violence. Thousands of families enter the city’s domestic violence shelter system each year, according to DSS records, but, as City Limits has reported , more than half end up being discharged from those specialized facilities into the broader Department of Homeless Services (DHS) system. At least 41 percent of families in DHS shelters had fled domestic violence, according to the 2019 report by the comptroller. Many end up returning to their abusers rather than remain in shelters. Nicole Branca, executive director at the housing agency New Destiny, said the small grants often enable recipients—primarily families headed by women of color—to find and maintain stable housing. New Destiny has issued the so-called “low-barrier grants,” typically totaling around $1,000 to $2,000, to help cover back rent, utilities and childcare costs in a pinch, Branca said. “We’ve seen it make all the difference [in] allowing a family to stay in housing rather than go into shelter,” she said. The key is ensuring people can access the money immediately. Branca said she issues checks directly to landlords or daycare providers on behalf of the applicant. “You can’t do this through a reimbursement process three months later,” she said. “At that point, they would have lost their housing.” Branca, a former city housing official, said she also hopes the grant program approved by the City Council will fund community-based organizations that provide aftercare services, such as case management, to formerly homeless families who enter permanent housing. The bill received six “No” votes, from Republican Councilmembers Joann Arriola, Joseph Borrelli, David Carr, Vickie Paladino and Inna Vernikov, and Democrat Bob Holden, a conservative who often sides with Republican colleagues. Borrelli, the Council’s minority leader, said he was concerned that people will be able to “self attest or for a community organization to attest that they were victims, without any criminal charge, to access city funds for housing.” He said he and conservative colleagues support the concept but think survivors of domestic violence should only qualify if they press charges against the abuser. “Prosecuting domestic violence is as important as preventing it,” Borrelli said. Holden’s chief of staff, Daniel Kurzyna, also said the bill to provide small grants needs a  “mechanism for verification of a domestic violence incident.” “It does not require someone to report or have an incident investigated by law enforcement agencies,” Kurzyna said, adding that the current measure “invites fraud.” Existing state programs provide compensation for survivors of domestic violence who first report the abuse and work with police and prosecutors. But many advocates, including Cabán , cite a number of reasons why survivors may decline to press charges : they could be financially dependent on their abuser, fear additional retaliation or hesitate to get law enforcement involved because of their immigration status. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and several Democratic lawmakers, hailed the legislation on the Council floor. “We must work to create a safe environment where survivors have access to resources and services that promote health and safety,” Adams said.
