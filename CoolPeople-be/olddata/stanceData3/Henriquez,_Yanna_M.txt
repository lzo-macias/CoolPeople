Queens News Featured   A Queens councilmember told the Eagle that the mayor mischaracterized their conversations about bringing ICE to Rikers Island, a move that has landed the mayor in court and brought on accusations that he traded access to the jail for the dismissal of his criminal case. The City Council passed a resolution on Thursday calling on the state to pass a bill that would allow New York Mets owner Steve Cohen to build a casino on Citi Field’s parking lot. At the height of the pandemic, around 2,500 restaurants’ outdoor dining structures dotted Queens streets.  Lawyers for the Queens County Democratic Party told a judge this week that ballot petition signatures purportedly collected from voters by a canvasser for a Queens judicial candidate – and for several others running for office – were forged. The Adams administration’s plan to redevelop a large swath of Long Island City officially entered the city’s land use review process this week. The number of vehicle stop-and-searches committed by the NYPD skyrocketed last year – and the vast majority were conducted on Black and Latino drivers, newly released data shows. The trial of a Far Rockaway man accused of attempting to shoot two NYPD police officers began on Monday. For at least the next several days, federal immigration agents will not be allowed on Rikers Island, a Manhattan judge said Monday. Starting on Monday, lawyers for a handful of Queens City Council hopefuls will appear before a judge in Queens Supreme Civil Court to argue their client should stay on the ballot for the upcoming primary election – or that someone else should be kicked off of it. Street vendors in Queens are resorting to an increasingly expensive tactic to survive New York City’s multi-agency quality-of-life crackdown on Roosevelt Avenue: paying thousands of dollars for black-market food permits. Voices from Queens Featured   “As lifelong New Yorkers and environmental professionals, we are sounding the alarm. Queens Future’s proposal is greenwashing. The so-called “Metropolitan Park” is not a park—it’s a sprawling casino development dressed in the language of sustainability.” “The staffing crisis within the NYPD is real.” “The Packaging Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act is a well-intentioned but deeply flawed approach that threatens to impose an unbearable financial burden on working-class families and the small businesses that drive New York’s economy.” “Speaker Adrienne Adams and the City Council have delivered a comprehensive approach to address every aspect of this crisis with their City for All plan.” “Proposition 1 might sound good on the surface, but voters need to carefully examine this proposition’s broader implications, and understand what is really lurking behind its flowery title and optimistic wording.” “Access to sexual and reproductive healthcare should be guaranteed for New Yorkers — not dependent on who is in office. Without Prop 1, New Yorkers may very well face deadly consequences.” Home / / Queens News / / Coronavirus / / Law / / Crime / / Politics / / Communities / / Voices / / Who We Are / / Newsletter / / Queens Daily Eagle Today’s Print Eagle Subscribe to the digital version of our daily print edition delivered to your inbox every day.

In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom such personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed, upon receipt of a request by a California resident. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As noted above, we do not disclose such personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.

Queens News Home / / Queens News / / Coronavirus / / Law / / Crime / / Politics / / Communities / / Voices / / Who We Are / / Newsletter / / April 16, 2025 Queens candidates bring in over $1 million in matching funds April 16, 2025 / Jacob Kaye Erycka Montoya, a Democratic candidate running for City Council District 21, brought in more public matching funds than any other non-incumbent Queens candidate on Tuesday. Photo via Montoya’s campaign By Jacob Kaye Over a dozen candidates running for City Council in Queens were gifted public matching funds by the city’s Campaign Finance Board on Tuesday. The total haul for local candidates through the eight-to-one matching program that has become vital to winning office in New York City surpassed $1 million. For a little less than half of the Queens Council candidates, Tuesday’s awarded funds marked the first time they’ve been able to access the money this election cycle. The biggest earner on Tuesday was City Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who is facing a Democratic primary challenge from Ricardo Pacheco, who also was awarded funds on Tuesday. The CFB voted to give the incumbent around $192,500 after he raised $69,136. Pacheco, who has raised $10,135 this cycle, was awarded $16,212. City Councilmember Linda Lee, who is running unopposed in the Democratic primary but will likely face a challenger in November’s general election, brought in the second-highest total in Queens on Tuesday with a $153,832 haul. Lee and Krishnan were the only two incumbents to be awarded the funds this week, with the rest going to candidates running for one of the three open seats in the borough. In District 21, which is currently represented by term-limited Councilmember Francisco Moya, five of the six Democratic candidates running for the seat were awarded the funds. Erycka Montoya, who has earned the backing of the Working Families Party, topped the field with $118,917 in matching funds. Sandro Navarro, who works as the district director for State Senator Jessica Ramos, was the only other candidate in the race to bring in over $100,000. Yanna Henriquez, a district leader, brought in $70,262, Democratic committee member David Aiken brought in $57,912 and Shanel Thomas-Henry, a local organizer, brought in $28,614. The only other Democratic candidate in the race, Hiram Monserrate, was denied public matching funds because his campaign was not-compliant with the CFB’s matching funds program’s rules. Monserrate was one of two candidates citywide to be cited for non-compliance, the other being Mayor Eric Adams. In District 28, which is currently represented by term-limited Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, four of the five candidates running for the seat got the matching funds, including; Tyrell Hankerson, who brought in $73,408; Romeo Hitlall, who brought in $35,922; Latoya LeGrand, who brought in $12,814; and Japneet Singh, who brought in $702. Ruben Wills, the former councilmember booted from the legislature after being convicted of corruption and who has since been found to have been wrongfully convicted, was the only candidate denied funds in the District 28 race. The board said they didn’t give Wills funds for three reasons – he didn’t meet the fundraising threshold, he didn’t submit his personal financial disclosure to the Conflicts of Interest Board before the deadline and he did not complete a mandatory compliance training. In City Council District 30, which is currently represented by term-limitted Councilmember Robert Holden, three of the five candidates running for the seat were granted the money. Republican candidate Alicia Vaichunas led the charge with $62,700 in matching funds. Democrats Paul Pogozelski and Dermot Smyth were awarded $56,164 and $31,179 respectively. District 30 Democratic candidate Phil Wong, who, alongside Vaichunas, earned a dual endorsement from their boss, Holden, was denied funds because the variance between the receipts he reported and those that were documented were greater than 10 percent. Mike Lopez, another Democratic candidate in the race, was denied the funds because he too had a variance of greater than 10 percent. He also didn’t meet the fundraising threshold. Citywide, the board denied matching funds to mayoral frontrunner Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday after the board said his campaign didn’t meet the fundraising threshold and had a high percentage of errors in its paperwork. Cuomo's campaign blamed the denial on a software error that failed to collect information needed by the CFB in order to issue the funds. Cuomo, who entered the race in February, has yet to be issued a cent in matching funds but has raised a significant sum, including $1.5 million in the most recent fundraising period. Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani brought in more matching funds than any other candidate citywide on Tuesday, with a $3,832,987 haul. The second-highest sum for a mayoral candidate went to independent Jim Walden, who was given a little over $1.9 million by the CFB. Matching funds will next be doled out on May 12, a little more than month before election day.

The Adams administration’s plan to redevelop a large swath of Long Island City officially entered the city’s land use review process this week. The number of vehicle stop-and-searches committed by the NYPD skyrocketed last year – and the vast majority were conducted on Black and Latino drivers, newly released data shows. The trial of a Far Rockaway man accused of attempting to shoot two NYPD police officers began on Monday. For at least the next several days, federal immigration agents will not be allowed on Rikers Island, a Manhattan judge said Monday. Starting on Monday, lawyers for a handful of Queens City Council hopefuls will appear before a judge in Queens Supreme Civil Court to argue their client should stay on the ballot for the upcoming primary election – or that someone else should be kicked off of it. Street vendors in Queens are resorting to an increasingly expensive tactic to survive New York City’s multi-agency quality-of-life crackdown on Roosevelt Avenue: paying thousands of dollars for black-market food permits.

Queens News Home / / Queens News / / Coronavirus / / Law / / Crime / / Politics / / Communities / / Voices / / Who We Are / / Newsletter / / April 15, 2025 Fight over ballot petitions begins April 15, 2025 / Ryan Schwach The fight to get on the ballot is underway in Queens. Eagle file photo by Ryan Schwach By Ryan Schwach For weeks, dozens of candidates in Queens have hit the streets to ask voters not for their support, cash or vote – but for their name, address and signature. The tedious process of collecting ballot petition signatures, which came to an end earlier this month, in some ways marks the first real test for any candidate running for office in New York City. Candidates with deep pockets, an inspired group of volunteers or support of their local party organization should pass the test with flying colors, collecting three to four times as many signatures as the law requires. Candidates without such support likely struggled to hit the signature threshold. What’s left after the collection process is a group of candidates that will likely appear on the ballot come election day – as long as they survive the legal challenges to their petitions that have expectedly come to most candidates. Campaigns had until Monday at midnight to file their specific objections to their competitors' petitions, all in the hopes of getting them knocked off the ballot. This week, the Board of Elections will begin to parse through the accusations and begin to whittle down the field of candidates running for elected office until the city is left with a final ballot at the end of the month. Over 200 objections were filed against candidates running for office in the World’s Borough. In Queens, a majority of the candidates running in one of the three open City Council seats told the Eagle that they collected more than enough signatures to withstand any objections to their petitions. Others have just squeaked by. And while the entire process of collecting signatures and then defending them before the BOE – or sometimes in court – has been described as a tiresome process, even its critics say it has value. “It is a necessary and tedious task,” long-time election lawyer Jerry Goldfeder said. “When a candidate is personally involved it is a good way of meeting voters.” However, the veteran counselor isn’t exactly a fan of petitioning. When the Eagle asked him what voters should glean from candidates petitioning numbers, he gave as straightforward an answer as one could give. “Nothing,” he said in a text message. Goldfeder argued that paid petitioners, rather than volunteers, have watered down the actual merits of the process, and that the idea of needing signatures to appear on a ballot is arcane at best. “The stated rationale for petitioning has historically been to show community support so as to not clog the ballot with too many candidates,” Goldfeder wrote in a recent op-ed. “With the advent of paid petitioners and the liberalization of petition requirements, this reasoning rings hollow. Its major function these days is to give political adversaries the opportunity to knock them off the ballot in time-consuming and costly litigation.” The litigations Goldfeder is speaking of – called objections – are often as numerous as the signatures themselves, and involve one candidate taking legal issue with an opponent’s petitions in an attempt to invalidate their candidacy. The objections are often centered on mundane and seemingly innocuous mistakes – for instance, abbreviating street as “St.” or Avenue as “Ave.” “Voters shouldn’t be deprived of voting for candidates because of arcane, hypertechnical mistakes,” Goldfeder told the Eagle. “Opponents would rather knock off competitors than run a race.” In Queens, at least 220 objections were filed against candidates with the Board of Elections. Most were filed against those running for the lowest-level position on the ballot – county party committee members. Republican John David Rinaldi, a perennial candidate who's been known to harass his opponents on the campaign trail, filed 69 different objections against Queens and citywide Republican candidates, including his primary opponent in Queens’ City Council District 29. But petitioning remains a quintessential part of the city’s electoral process. In the World’s Borough, 27 candidates have filed petitions to run for City Council. Council candidates need a minimum 450 to 900 petition signatures from active voters who are members of the candidate’s party in order to get their name on the ballot. Hitting that number is a point of pride and accomplishment for candidates. However, candidates often aim for more than three times that number – around 2,000 – to ensure that objections and invalidations don’t bring them beneath the threshold. The Eagle asked every candidate running for Council in Queens how many signatures they collected. Ten responded. Most of the candidates running in Southeast Queens’ District 28, which is currently represented by term-limited Council speaker and mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams, secured enough signatures to likely withstand a bevy of challenges. District 28 candidate Japneet Singh reported bringing in around 3,500 signatures, well over the needed amount. As for his “Great 28” opponents, Tyrell Hankerson received 2,300, Romeo Hitlall reported 1,400 and former office holder Ruben Wills turned in 1,900 signatures. The only other candidate in that race, Latoya LeGrand, did not respond to the Eagle’s request for comment. The Eagle reported on Monday that a petition page featuring 15 signatures for Wills and a trio of other candidates appeared to have several allegedly fraudulent signatures. Voters in the South Jamaica Houses told the Eagle that they didn’t sign the sheet, despite their name, signature and address appearing on it. LeGrand’s name was listed on her opponent’s questionable petition sheet. Wills has not been accused of petition fraud. In one of Queens’ other closely watched open races, District 21 candidates Shanel Thomas-Henry and Hiram Monserrate both filed over 2,000 signatures. Erycka Montoya, a staffer for Council Speaker Adams, reported 1,530 signatures. Other D21 candidates Yanna Henriquez, Sandro Navarro and David Aiken did not respond to the Eagle’s requests for petitioning numbers. Regardless of the tedious, arguably archaic process that is petitioning, elected officials and candidates alike often speak highly of it. For new candidates, it is an introduction to the technical, bureaucratic process of getting elected. It’s also another way to meet voters and drum up support for a candidate’s campaign. “It was really informative and it's humbling, because you get the doors slammed in your face,” said Paul Pogozelski, who is running as a Democrat to replace term-limited Bob Holden in Western Queens. Pogozelski, who turned in around 1,100 signatures for his first attempt at local office, said petitioning helped him learn about the issues voters felt were important. “That was the best thing that actually happened,” he said. “It was eye-opening.” Pogozelski went door-to-door to collect the signatures rather than collecting them on busy corners, as others elect to do. He enlisted volunteers with connections to the roller hockey league he founded and currently runs in Middle Village. “They would do a couple blocks around their house, but that actually gave us a really good base,” he said. “We went to the approach of actually doing it at the doors, because I just felt like it's a better connection.” Pogozelski’s Democratic primary challenger Phil Wong, who works in Holden’s office, told the Eagle he received 1,055 signatures. Neither Michael Lopez nor Dermot Smyth, both Democrats who are also running for the seat, responded to the Eagle’s petition numbers request. The only other candidate who responded to the Eagle’s request for petitioning numbers was Alexander Caruso, a Democrat who is running with the Working Families Party endorsement for District 19. He said he was just above the threshold with 973 petitions filed. His primary opponents, Youn Chung and Benjamin Chou, did not respond to requests for their numbers. For veteran incumbents, petitioning may be something of a formality, but for them too, it is a chance to gauge the energy behind their campaign and return to boots-on-the-ground politics. Jackson Heights Councilmember Shekar Krishnan is running for a third time this year, and is one of three Queens incumbents with a registered primary opponent. As a well-known councilmember with a political party behind him, Krishnan likely won’t have any issues getting on the ballot. Still, he said he enjoys hitting the streets with the green petitioning sheets. “I get energized by it, I feed off of it,” he said. “I just feel like it's a great opportunity to be out there to talk to neighbors, to talk to voters about the work that we're doing, hear from them and talk about the work and our vision for moving forward.” If anything, Krishnan wishes the process started a little closer to the June primary, when the weather is a little warmer. “It's cold outside,” he said. “But I have found every time I've done it, I've come away feeling energized and inspired to keep going.” The final results of petitioning won’t be known until the end of April, when all objections will have been filed and argued either before the BOE or in court. Whenever challenges to petitions are made to the BOE, the agency assigns a team of bipartisan clerks to review the claims. The clerks then issue a report, which will be reviewed and voted on by the BOE during a hearing, where both the campaign that challenged the petition and the campaign that is defending the petition can raise exceptions to the report. Any candidate alleging that a petition has fraudulent signatures would be required to file a “petition to invalidate” in court. Campaigns have until April 17 to file their claims in court. The Board of Elections will certify the primary ballot on April 28.

The tedious process of collecting ballot petition signatures, which came to an end earlier this month, in some ways marks the first real test for any candidate running for office in New York City. Candidates with deep pockets, an inspired group of volunteers or support of their local party organization should pass the test with flying colors, collecting three to four times as many signatures as the law requires. Candidates without such support likely struggled to hit the signature threshold. What’s left after the collection process is a group of candidates that will likely appear on the ballot come election day – as long as they survive the legal challenges to their petitions that have expectedly come to most candidates. Campaigns had until Monday at midnight to file their specific objections to their competitors' petitions, all in the hopes of getting them knocked off the ballot. This week, the Board of Elections will begin to parse through the accusations and begin to whittle down the field of candidates running for elected office until the city is left with a final ballot at the end of the month. Over 200 objections were filed against candidates running for office in the World’s Borough. In Queens, a majority of the candidates running in one of the three open City Council seats told the Eagle that they collected more than enough signatures to withstand any objections to their petitions. Others have just squeaked by. And while the entire process of collecting signatures and then defending them before the BOE – or sometimes in court – has been described as a tiresome process, even its critics say it has value. “It is a necessary and tedious task,” long-time election lawyer Jerry Goldfeder said. “When a candidate is personally involved it is a good way of meeting voters.” However, the veteran counselor isn’t exactly a fan of petitioning. When the Eagle asked him what voters should glean from candidates petitioning numbers, he gave as straightforward an answer as one could give. “Nothing,” he said in a text message. Goldfeder argued that paid petitioners, rather than volunteers, have watered down the actual merits of the process, and that the idea of needing signatures to appear on a ballot is arcane at best. “The stated rationale for petitioning has historically been to show community support so as to not clog the ballot with too many candidates,” Goldfeder wrote in a recent op-ed. “With the advent of paid petitioners and the liberalization of petition requirements, this reasoning rings hollow. Its major function these days is to give political adversaries the opportunity to knock them off the ballot in time-consuming and costly litigation.” The litigations Goldfeder is speaking of – called objections – are often as numerous as the signatures themselves, and involve one candidate taking legal issue with an opponent’s petitions in an attempt to invalidate their candidacy. The objections are often centered on mundane and seemingly innocuous mistakes – for instance, abbreviating street as “St.” or Avenue as “Ave.” “Voters shouldn’t be deprived of voting for candidates because of arcane, hypertechnical mistakes,” Goldfeder told the Eagle. “Opponents would rather knock off competitors than run a race.” In Queens, at least 220 objections were filed against candidates with the Board of Elections. Most were filed against those running for the lowest-level position on the ballot – county party committee members. Republican John David Rinaldi, a perennial candidate who's been known to harass his opponents on the campaign trail, filed 69 different objections against Queens and citywide Republican candidates, including his primary opponent in Queens’ City Council District 29. But petitioning remains a quintessential part of the city’s electoral process. In the World’s Borough, 27 candidates have filed petitions to run for City Council. Council candidates need a minimum 450 to 900 petition signatures from active voters who are members of the candidate’s party in order to get their name on the ballot. Hitting that number is a point of pride and accomplishment for candidates. However, candidates often aim for more than three times that number – around 2,000 – to ensure that objections and invalidations don’t bring them beneath the threshold. The Eagle asked every candidate running for Council in Queens how many signatures they collected. Ten responded. Most of the candidates running in Southeast Queens’ District 28, which is currently represented by term-limited Council speaker and mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams, secured enough signatures to likely withstand a bevy of challenges. District 28 candidate Japneet Singh reported bringing in around 3,500 signatures, well over the needed amount. As for his “Great 28” opponents, Tyrell Hankerson received 2,300, Romeo Hitlall reported 1,400 and former office holder Ruben Wills turned in 1,900 signatures. The only other candidate in that race, Latoya LeGrand, did not respond to the Eagle’s request for comment. The Eagle reported on Monday that a petition page featuring 15 signatures for Wills and a trio of other candidates appeared to have several allegedly fraudulent signatures. Voters in the South Jamaica Houses told the Eagle that they didn’t sign the sheet, despite their name, signature and address appearing on it. LeGrand’s name was listed on her opponent’s questionable petition sheet. Wills has not been accused of petition fraud. In one of Queens’ other closely watched open races, District 21 candidates Shanel Thomas-Henry and Hiram Monserrate both filed over 2,000 signatures. Erycka Montoya, a staffer for Council Speaker Adams, reported 1,530 signatures. Other D21 candidates Yanna Henriquez, Sandro Navarro and David Aiken did not respond to the Eagle’s requests for petitioning numbers. Regardless of the tedious, arguably archaic process that is petitioning, elected officials and candidates alike often speak highly of it. For new candidates, it is an introduction to the technical, bureaucratic process of getting elected. It’s also another way to meet voters and drum up support for a candidate’s campaign. “It was really informative and it's humbling, because you get the doors slammed in your face,” said Paul Pogozelski, who is running as a Democrat to replace term-limited Bob Holden in Western Queens.

Neither Michael Lopez nor Dermot Smyth, both Democrats who are also running for the seat, responded to the Eagle’s petition numbers request. The only other candidate who responded to the Eagle’s request for petitioning numbers was Alexander Caruso, a Democrat who is running with the Working Families Party endorsement for District 19.

Queens News Featured   A Queens councilmember told the Eagle that the mayor mischaracterized their conversations about bringing ICE to Rikers Island, a move that has landed the mayor in court and brought on accusations that he traded access to the jail for the dismissal of his criminal case. The City Council passed a resolution on Thursday calling on the state to pass a bill that would allow New York Mets owner Steve Cohen to build a casino on Citi Field’s parking lot. At the height of the pandemic, around 2,500 restaurants’ outdoor dining structures dotted Queens streets.  Lawyers for the Queens County Democratic Party told a judge this week that ballot petition signatures purportedly collected from voters by a canvasser for a Queens judicial candidate – and for several others running for office – were forged. The Adams administration’s plan to redevelop a large swath of Long Island City officially entered the city’s land use review process this week. The number of vehicle stop-and-searches committed by the NYPD skyrocketed last year – and the vast majority were conducted on Black and Latino drivers, newly released data shows. The trial of a Far Rockaway man accused of attempting to shoot two NYPD police officers began on Monday. For at least the next several days, federal immigration agents will not be allowed on Rikers Island, a Manhattan judge said Monday. Starting on Monday, lawyers for a handful of Queens City Council hopefuls will appear before a judge in Queens Supreme Civil Court to argue their client should stay on the ballot for the upcoming primary election – or that someone else should be kicked off of it. Street vendors in Queens are resorting to an increasingly expensive tactic to survive New York City’s multi-agency quality-of-life crackdown on Roosevelt Avenue: paying thousands of dollars for black-market food permits. Voices from Queens Featured   “As lifelong New Yorkers and environmental professionals, we are sounding the alarm. Queens Future’s proposal is greenwashing. The so-called “Metropolitan Park” is not a park—it’s a sprawling casino development dressed in the language of sustainability.” “The staffing crisis within the NYPD is real.” “The Packaging Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act is a well-intentioned but deeply flawed approach that threatens to impose an unbearable financial burden on working-class families and the small businesses that drive New York’s economy.” “Speaker Adrienne Adams and the City Council have delivered a comprehensive approach to address every aspect of this crisis with their City for All plan.” “Proposition 1 might sound good on the surface, but voters need to carefully examine this proposition’s broader implications, and understand what is really lurking behind its flowery title and optimistic wording.” “Access to sexual and reproductive healthcare should be guaranteed for New Yorkers — not dependent on who is in office. Without Prop 1, New Yorkers may very well face deadly consequences.” Home / / Queens News / / Coronavirus / / Law / / Crime / / Politics / / Communities / / Voices / / Who We Are / / Newsletter / / Queens Daily Eagle Today’s Print Eagle Subscribe to the digital version of our daily print edition delivered to your inbox every day.
