His father, a former livery cab driver and later President of the Non-Medallion Livery Association, instilled in him the importance of fighting for a better future. Freddy’s upbringing in our community and education in our public schools shaped his dedication to service. After graduating from Aviation High School, Freddy joined the Marine Corps and served our country for six years. While he was stationed overseas, tragedy struck home. His father was killed in a senseless act of violence while fighting for the community he loved. Determined to honor his father’s legacy, Freddy returned to the Bronx to continue his advocacy. A Lifelong Commitment to Our Community: For over 16 years, Freddy has owned and operated a small business in the South Bronx while also serving on Community Board 1 and as Chair of the Land Use Committee. Through initiatives like annual toy drives and turkey giveaways, Freddy has been there for our community in every way possible. His commitment extends beyond the Bronx, with humanitarian efforts in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. Freddy lives with his wife of over 20 years in the South Bronx. As the Male Democratic District Leader for the 84th Assembly District, he continues to champion our values, ensuring that the voices of the South Bronx are heard at every level.
