meet jumaane THE PEOPLE’S ADVOCATE.  Jumaane Williams has served as New York City’s Public Advocate since 2019. Since becoming Public Advocate, the second-highest ranking office in New York City, Jumaane has restructured the office to empower staff to prioritize community engagement, outreach, and service. He has also passed more legislation in office than all previous Public Advocates combined, including key bills that protect New Yorkers in the workplace and those looking for work, shield struggling homeowners from undue tax burdens, increase public safety, and fight discrimination in our housing systems. Prior to serving as Public Advocate, he represented Brooklyn’s 45th District in the New York City Council from 2009-2019. Jumaane is a first-generation Brooklynite of Grenadian heritage. He was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome and ADHD as a teenager, persevering as he came up through the public school system from pre-school to Master’s. After graduating, Jumaane began his career as a community organizer by serving as the assistant director for the Greater Flatbush Beacon School, then later as the executive director of New York State Tenants & Neighbors, where he fought for truly affordable, income targeted housing across the city and state. In 2009, he defeated an incumbent to begin his career as an activist elected official in the New York City Council. During his time at City Hall, Jumaane has championed landmark legislation to create transformational change. In his first term, Jumaane aimed to end the abuse of the NYPD’s use of stop, question and frisk by sponsoring the Community Safety Act. The legislation was enacted despite a veto from then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and helped put an end to unlawful policing practices typically used in communities of more color, while creating the NYPD’s Office of Inspector General to investigate unlawful or unethical practices within the department. As Co-Chair of the Council’s Task Force to Combat Gun Violence, he helped launch New York’s Crisis Management System, which funds Cure Violence Groups that work to reduce shootings through a multi-pronged, community-centered approach. As Chairman of the Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, he challenged the de Blasio administration’s inadequate affordable housing plan by advocating for more deeply affordable housing to help prevent communities from being priced out of the five boroughs.. Throughout his over decade of service in government, Jumaane never stopped standing with marginalized communities to fight for justice and equity for all, and has never been afraid to put his body on the line. He has been arrested more than any other sitting elected official in New York, standing up for women’s rights, immigration rights, housing rights, and more.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room NYC Public Advocate Calls To End Flawed NYPC Gang Database, Improve Actual Public Safety February 24th, 2025 Press Release Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams today joined the New York City Council Committee on Public Safety to call for an end to the NYPD's Criminal Group Database (CGD), also known as the gang database. In his remarks before the committee, the Public Advocate underscored the disproportionate impact of the database on Black and Hispanic youth, the lack of transparency around its criteria for inclusion, and the harm it causes to individuals and communities. “It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it,” said Public Advocate Williams . “Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database.” The database currently contains approximately 16,000 names, with 99 percent of individuals identified as Black or Hispanic and 98 percent as male. It includes minors as young as 13 years old. The Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD has reported that the department has violated its own database entry and renewal processes, failing to provide sufficient guidance for inclusion and review. Today’s hearing included testimony on Intro 798 , legislation sponsored by Council Member Althea Stevens and co-sponsored by the Public Advocate, which seeks to abolish the database, prohibit the establishment of a similar system, and ensure individuals are notified if they have been listed in the database. The bill would also provide a process for individuals to request and review records before the database is dismantled. “Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes,” the Public Advocate continued.  “We should be focusing our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services.” The Public Advocate reiterated that the issue is not necessarily police presence but rather the misuse of law enforcement resources and the failure to invest in community-driven solutions. He urged the Council and the administration to shift focus from punitive measures to meaningful investments in the well-being of vulnerable communities. The Public Advocate’s full opening comments as delivered are below. He also questioned the administration’s representatives multiple times – see those discussions here . STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS
TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY
FEBRUARY 24, 2025 Thank you Mr. Chair, I appreciate it, and I also want to note, it is also before noon and I am present. Good morning, My name is Jumaane D. Williams, and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. I would like to thank Chair Salaam and the members of the Committee on Public Safety for holding this important hearing. Since 2013, the NYPD has maintained a database of what they characterize as intelligence regarding criminal groups and street gangs. This Criminal Group Database (CGD)—or, as it is colloquially called, the “gang database”—according to the NYPD, contains about 16,000 entries and allows them to discern trends, relationships and patterns to enhance public safety and criminal investigations. However, advocates, lawyers, and individuals in the database themselves report that it is largely full of men and boys of more color, many of whom have no gang affiliation at all. It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it. Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database. In the last few years, the NYPD has expanded “self-admission” criteria to include social media postings—which can include emojis or hashtags, or other unclear and undisclosed criteria. This raises questions not only about the interpretation of these posts as admittance of gang membership, but also of whether the NYPD can definitively attribute a post to an individual. I think anyone who uses social media can relate to posting something without thinking or something that was misconstrued—it does not mean that they are admitting to being in a gang. A report from the OIG-NYPD found that 99 percent of those in the CGD are Black or Hispanic, 98 percent male, and contains kids as young as 13 years old. These demographics are reminiscent of the abuses of stop, question and frisk; in 2023, 59 percent of Terry stops were of Black people, and 30 percent were Hispanic. In a city that is 36 percent white, this looks like a disproportionate targeting of certain communities. Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes. Individuals labeled as gang members face obstacles in court, as prosecutors can raise alleged “dangerousness” when judges set bail, and claiming gang affiliation can easily color a jury’s perception of a defendant. It is a damaging allegation that is almost impossible for someone to refute. Contact with the criminal legal system can cost a NYCHA resident their housing, which is especially troubling given gang takeovers  appear to target public housing and the surrounding communities. And while we don’t know if gang takedowns in NYC have led to deportations, the gang label presents serious and unique legal problems for noncitizens. With President Trump in office and Mayor Adams collaborating with immigration enforcement at the behest of the administration, it is especially urgent to ensure that we are not mislabeling people as gang members. Today, we are hearing some bills including Intro 798, sponsored by Councilmember Stevens and of which I am a co-sponsor, which would abolish the Criminal Group Database and would prohibit a similar database from being established. It would also require notification to those in the database, as well as instruction for how they could request records contained in the database before it is destroyed. It is important to abolish the CGD for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NYPD has violated its database entry and renewal processes, including renewing inclusion of minors in the database without qualifying police contact, and it does not provide sufficient guidance for gang database entry and lacks enforcement in its review processes. The NYPD has also historically been resistant to these types of changes. We should instead try to focus our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. At a hearing of this committee this past December, former Chief of Department Maddrey acknowledged that the NYPD has an increased presence in under-resourced communities, and that he wishes the city would bring more resources to those neighborhoods. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services. We know what works to prevent crime and violence. We also know that simply trying to arrest the children of the people arrested twenty years ago will not get there. I just want to also be clear: the issue for me is not necessarily police involvement. It is the consistent over-policing. Some of the takedowns that are happening, we have to come back several years later to do the same takedowns, because we haven't done any changes in those communities. Oftentimes I see in the news, these type of bills that are problems and they present violence from gangs themselves, even those these bills, so what it looks like some of the things we are doing aren’t working generationally, and it doesn't seem like a database like this stops the violence that we want to stop, but can cause additional harm to people who are not part of the legal system, that now may fall into further more problems in the legal system, because they were put there in the first place. So that is the issue that we are trying to fix. I don’t want the media to think that people up here are trying to promote violence, want violence in their communities, quite the opposite, we want it to stop. We also, in my opinion, want to stop asking the police to do everything and try to solve everything. It’s unfair to them and it’s unfair to the communities that they’re asked to solve these problems in. Back to press reports Public Advocate Jumaane D.

No. 41 Resolution calling on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation that allows service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to use the United States Department of Veteran Affairs home loans to purchase cooperative apartments. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Hanif, Yeger, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Dinowitz, Menin and Holden Whereas, The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) helps service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to become homeowners by offering a home loan; and Whereas, Home loans offered by the VA, known as VA loans, are provided by private lenders such as banks and mortgage companies; and Whereas, The VA guarantees a portion of the home loan, which enables the lender to provide favorable terms; and Whereas, The New York Times published an article titled, “A Loan Program for Veterans Comes Wrapped in Red Tape”, on June 10, 2013, which identified obstacles to using the VA loan to purchase a condominium or cooperative apartment in New York; and Whereas, The New York Times article highlights three challenges: 1) New York real estate firms have no experience with VA loans, 2) VA loans can only be used to purchase a condominium if the entire building applies to the VA for approval and 3) cooperative buildings are excluded from the VA loan program; and Whereas, According to the National Association of Housing Cooperatives,  more than 1.2 million families in the United States live in homes owned and operated through a cooperative association and most of these units are located in major urban areas such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York City; and Whereas, Cooperative units are often a less expensive housing option when compared to condominium units or single-family houses; and Whereas, Veterans seeking to find a home in New York City or other major urban areas should have similar home buying support as veterans who purchase homes in suburban or rural areas; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation that allows service members, veterans and eligible surviving spouses to use the United States Department of Veteran Affairs home loans to purchase cooperative apartments.

No. 641 Resolution calling on the coordination of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), the New York State Office of Court Administration, and New York City District Attorneys to expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Levin, Cumbo, Ayala, Lander, Kallos, Treyger, Rivera and Miller Whereas, In recent years many jurisdictions around the country have sought to correct the wrongs of the war on drugs and collateral consequences of marijuana-related convictions; and Whereas, In New York City, enforcement policies have been amended to move further away from criminalizing the low-level possession and use of marijuana; and Whereas, As of September 2018, the New York City Police Department committed to issuing criminal summons in lieu of arrests for the majority of persons found smoking marijuana in public; and Whereas, Arrests will only be made if persons are on probation or parole, have an existing criminal warrant, a recent history of violence, does not possess a form of identification, or if their smoking poses an immediate public safety risk, such as while driving a car; and Whereas, While the City has taken steps to improve enforcement, a legacy of unduly harsh policies has had significantly negative adverse consequences on those with convictions for marijuana possession, hindering access to housing, education, and employment prospects for persons with decades-old convictions; and Whereas, Due to racial disparities in policing strategies, research shows that poor communities of color are disproportionately affected by marijuana convictions; and Whereas, According to the Misdemeanor Project at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, between 1993 and 2016, arrestees for marijuana-related charges were overwhelmingly Black and Latino men, despite there being no difference in usage across race; and Whereas, As many states have now legalized marijuana for recreational use, some jurisdictions, including San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle have automatically cleared prior misdemeanor convictions for possession; and Whereas, New York should follow in the footsteps of these jurisdictions; therefore be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the coordination of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), the New York State Office of Court Administration, and New York City District Attorneys to expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions LS 7034/7208 10/18/2018 CMA Legislation Text Legislation Details Legislation Details (With Text) Details Details Details Details Reports Reports Reports Reports File #: File #: Res 0641-2018 Version: * Res 0641-2018 Version: * Name: Name: Expunge the records of all city misdemeanor marijuana convictions.

No. 296 Resolution calling on the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth and fifth degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses,” and stop considering these offenses as grounds for termination of tenancy. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Ampry-Samuel, Reynoso, Lander, Kallos, Rivera, Ayala and Miller Whereas, Scientific and medical studies have shown that marijuana is less harmful than legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco; and Whereas, A 2015 study published in Scientific Reports found that marijuana is 114 times less deadly than alcohol; and Whereas, That study also found that marijuana presented the lowest mortality risk of the drugs it examined, which also included tobacco, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, and methamphetamines; and Whereas, Marijuana has a well-documented history of health benefits; and Whereas, In January of 2017, the United States National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a report that analyzed more than 10,000 studies and found strong evidence that marijuana lessened chronic pain in adults as well as various side effects of multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy; and Whereas, Moreover, experimentation with cannabis has become common in the United States; and Whereas, A Marist poll released in January found that 52 percent of American adults have tried marijuana and that 56 percent believed the drug to be “socially acceptable;” and Whereas, Even though cannabis poses no unique harms, offers medical benefits, and has been used by millions, prospective residents of public housing in New York City can face up to three years of ineligibility if they are convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession, under federal law and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations; and Whereas, These directives also burden the relatives of those who have been convicted, as NYCHA can deny admission to family members of individuals convicted of Class A or B misdemeanors; and Whereas, In recent years, both federal and local agencies have sought to mitigate these collateral consequences; and Whereas, In June of 2011, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan advised executive directors of public housing authorities across the country to consider “second chances,” and examine “all factors that might suggest favorable future conduct” in reviewing applications from potential tenants; and Whereas, In November of 2014, the New York Police Department (NYPD) announced that it would stop arresting those found to be in possession of up to 25 grams of marijuana, and begin issuing court summonses and fines instead; and Whereas, It is worth noting that New York is one of sixteen states that does not ban individuals from receiving public assistance due to a prior drug conviction; and Whereas, New York state law still treats possession of marijuana in a public place, which can include transportation facilities, parks, and places of amusement, as a crime, for which one can spend as many as three months in jail; and Whereas, This means that an applicant for public housing who was found in possession of a small amount of marijuana in a public park, a class B misdemeanor, could not only spend time in jail but also make his or her family ineligible for public housing for three years; and Whereas, NYCHA has the discretion to determine which offenses it overlooks and which it considers for prospective applicants; and Whereas, In accordance with existing medical consensus, and consistent with prior federal and local policy shifts, adding fourth and fifth degree marijuana possession to NYCHA’s list of overlooked offenses would not only preserve access to public housing for thousands but also prevent families from adverse circumstances in the event of a minor drug infraction; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon NYCHA to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth and fifth degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses,” and stop considering these offenses as grounds for termination of tenancy MK LS# 9704/Res.1784/2017 LS # 690 1/2/18 Legislation Text Legislation Details Legislation Details (With Text) Details Details Details Details Reports Reports Reports Reports File #: File #: Res 0296-2018 Version: * Res 0296-2018 Version: * Name: Name: NYCHA to add unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana in the 4th & 5th degrees to its list of “overlooked offenses.

The department is prohibited from engaging in attempts to unnecessarily prolong, delay or undermine an individual’s escorted movements. 2. The department shall not place an incarcerated person in restraints beyond the use of restraints described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision, or on two consecutive days, until a hearing is held to determine if the continued use of restraints is necessary for the safety of others.

Pre-hearing temporary restrictive housing. In exceptional circumstances, the department may place a person in pre-hearing temporary restrictive housing prior to conducting a restrictive housing hearing as required by subdivision f of this section. 1. Such placement shall only occur upon written approval of the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, or another equivalent member of department senior leadership over the operations of security. Such written approval shall include: the basis for a reasonable belief that the incarcerated person has committed a violent grade I offense, and whether such person has caused serious physical injury or poses a specific and significant risk of imminent serious physical injury to staff or other incarcerated persons. 2. A restrictive housing hearing shall occur as soon as reasonably practicable following placement in pre-hearing temporary restrictive housing, and must occur within five days of such placement, unless the person placed in such restrictive housing seeks a postponement of such hearing. 3.

If an individual is not discharged from restrictive housing after review, the department shall provide in writing to the incarcerated person: (i) the reasons for the determination that such person must remain in restrictive housing and (ii) any recommended program, treatment, service, or corrective action. The department shall provide the incarcerated person access to such available programs, treatment and services. 3. The department shall discharge an incarcerated person from restrictive housing if such person has not engaged in behavior that presents a specific, significant, and imminent threat to the safety and security of themselves or other persons during the preceding 15 days. In all circumstances, the department shall discharge an incarcerated person from restrictive housing within 30 days after their initial placement in such housing. 4.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room April 9th, 2025 Press Release April 9th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Adams Administration Inviting ICE to Rikers "The idea that Mayor Adams was recused from this decision is laughable. The deal was made a month ago, in the mayor’s agreement with ICE. His weak attempt to insulate himself from criticism for doing the Trump administration’s bidding is transparently ridiculous, and New Yorkers will see through it. "The truth is that the mayor has long looked for every opportunity to expand collaboration with ICE – whether it was his own position or Donald Trump’s. By misleading the public about our sanctuary policies, he’s attempting to make it more acceptable to chip away at them and deport more immigrant New Yorkers, regardless of criminality or 'illegality.' This mayor has already demonstrated a willingness to ignore laws he doesn’t like, especially on Rikers, and this latest example is nothing more than an attempt to aid the Trump deportation machine that rips immigrant families from their homes and students from their campuses." The Public Advocate will hold a virtual media availability at 1:00 PM today to further discuss this issue. Reporters can join by registering here . April 8th, 2025 Press Release April 8th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Condemns The Mayor Commending ICE "Mayor Adams offered a ' Hats Off' to ICE and Kristi Noem today as they have ripped families from homes, students from streets, and mistakenly sent people like Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to a horrific prison in El Salvador. At least now we know the so-called “independent” mayor’s hat is now MAGA-red by choice. “Like so much of the mayor’s conduct, this is a disgrace. This has never been about criminality or 'illegality.' While families are being swept up in Sackets Harbor and student activists are being abducted at Columbia and elsewhere, Mayor Adams is more interested in scolding the media, misleading New Yorkers, and falsely re-litigating the last few years than in dealing with the real inhumanity and danger of the moment. “No matter what he claims, the mayor is neither a messiah nor a martyr. And it is clear he is only interested in defending himself and Donald Trump, not New Yorkers. It’s up to the rest of us to stand with our neighbors – as they did in Sackets Harbor – and stand up to irresponsible, harmful leaders.” April 2nd, 2025 Press Release April 2nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate's Statement On The Dismissal Of The Mayor's Case "The mayor was always entitled to his day in court – instead, he’s used his power and privilege to sidestep the process. No matter what he’ll now claim, this isn’t a testament to his innocence, but to his capitulation and fear. "Judge Ho may have refunded the sale today, but Mayor Adams still sold out New York in the first place – and would unapologetically do so again and again. We’ll soon find out if his refusal to stand up to Donald Trump was because he was afraid, or because he agreed with him. "Prosecutors Danielle Sassoon, Hagan Scotten, First Deputy Torres-Springer and Deputy Mayors Parker, Joshi, and Williams-Isom are just some of the people who resigned because the mayor hasn’t cared enough about the city to do so himself. Based on the judge's own words, how can New Yorkers ever believe that the mayor won't continue to put his own interests above the best interests of our city?" March 29th, 2025 Press Release March 29th, 2025 Press Release NYC PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S STATEMENT ON EID AL-FITR "Eid Mubarak to all New Yorkers celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan. "Today as we celebrate Eid al-Fitr, we recognize the spirit that has defined this past month. I’ve been honored to join in many iftars and observances this year, and have been inspired and grounded by the resilience, resolve, generosity of our Muslim neighbors—values that extend far beyond today’s celebrations. "I know that for many in the Muslim community, this time of joy is also met with uncertainty and pain – with suffering abroad and threats at home challenging basic identity and ideals. In moments of crisis, we must reaffirm our shared commitment—to combating Islamophobia and hatred, to advocating for justice, and to building a city where every New Yorker feels safe and seen. "The lessons of Ramadan are universal. They remind us that our strength is greatest when it is shared. I pray that Eid brings you peace, blessings, and light, today and always." March 27th, 2025 Press Release March 27th, 2025 Press Release Emergency For Emergency Responders: NYC Public Advocate Calls On NYPD To Provide 911 Operators And Dispatchers With Safe Conditions And Staffing New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams today called for urgent action to address a looming emergency for emergency responders. 911 operators and dispatchers are facing untenable, unacceptable working conditions and staff shortages that could threaten the city’s emergency response systems if not addressed immediately. The Public Advocate recently raised these issues to NYPD Commissioner Tisch, and joined workers at a press conference outside 1 Police Plaza today to further discuss the urgent issues. “We have an emergency coming for our emergency responders – and there’s no one left for them to call,” said Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams . “Without fair conditions and benefits, an end to punitive forced overtime, and sufficient training and staffing, we could be heading for a crisis with no one on the other end of the line. This is a core public safety issue – we need fast emergency response. That means we need more responders, more experienced operators, and support for the trauma of the people supporting New Yorkers in traumatic moments.” 911 dispatchers and operators, members of DC37 Local 5911, report being routinely subject to unworkable conditions, including mandatory overtime under threat of penalty, with some workers unable to go home between 16-hour shifts and needing instead to sleep in the facilities. Despite the traumatic work they are engaged in on a regular basis, NYC’s Police Communications Technicians and Supervisors are considered clerical workers, and so not able to access mental health resources. As a result of these and other conditions, as well as pay that is not commensurate with the challenges of the work, staffing levels are alarmingly low and turnover is alarmingly high.  

In a letter to NYPD Commissioner Tisch, the Public Advocate documented serious issues and potential exploitative actions that workers have reported including: Punitive measures - including docking pay - for an inability to work forced overtime 16-hour mandatory overtime shifts several days a week Employees sleeping in locker room facilities due to time and financial constraints A lack of adequate mental health resources despite the trauma inherent in the work Hearing and vision loss due to inadequate equipment and poor facility conditions. To address these issues, the Public Advocate demanded the NYPD answer the following questions: Does the NYPD believe staffing to be adequate to successfully maintain the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? What are the overtime statistics compared to other divisions within the NYPD? What are the absenteeism rates compared to other divisions within the NYPD? What is the current retention rate, and how does it compare to the rate of vacancies filled? What strategies, if any, have proven successful in retaining staff? What contingency plans are in place if the system were to be overwhelmed? What specific measures are being considered to improve staff working conditions and overall well-being? What previous efforts to address these issues have been attempted, and why were they unsuccessful? If 100% of the funds from surcharges were redirected to 911 operations, how would you suggest they be used to strengthen operations? The dedication of Local 5911 workers is deep, but the consequences of a failure to address this crisis are dire. Read the full letter from the Public Advocate here . March 25th, 2025 Press Release March 25th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Argues To Strengthen Housing Protections Against Federal Budget Cuts Amid an ongoing effort by the federal government to reduce the budgets and effectiveness of federal housing programs, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. WIlliams pushed for the staffing and strengthening of municipal housing agencies. At a budget hearing of the Committee on Housing and Buildings, he argued that the safety of tenants and tradesmen alike depends on safe staffing levels and robust funding for inspection and infrastructure. “We cannot have unsafe and weakening infrastructure that puts New Yorkers at risk,” declared the Public Advocate. “I would like to know if the administration plans to respond to the federal government and meet the goal of being fully staffed for HPD and DOB.” This comes as City Hall and city agencies have been reluctant to criticize the actions of the Trump administration that negatively affect the lives of New Yorkers. As to the municipal budget and city administration, Public Advocate Williams noted that the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) currently has 382 open positions, a vacancy rate of 13.8 percent, and the Department of Buildings has over 200 vacant positions. He further highlighted the direct dangers of underfunding and understaffing, both to tenants and workers. There were 30 construction-related deaths on the job in 2023, the most in a decade, and that for DOB “... The average inspection response has been negatively impacted due to being understaffed. The average wait time for construction inspections increased to 4.2 days, plumbing inspections increased to 3.9 days, and electrical inspections increased to 9.4 days more than doubled from before.” In the face of federal cuts, the Public Advocate  asked “What is the City planning to do to protect the federal funds and capital projects? Also, how will the City respond to a potential and probable backlog on the administration of Section 8 applications?” The Public Advocate’s full comments as-delivered are below, and video is available here. STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND BUILDINGS MARCH 25, 2025 Thank you very much, Madame Chair. I just want to congratulate the Acting Commissioner, congratulations, couldn’t happen to a nicer, more attentive guy, so I appreciate that. And I want to shout out my 16 year old, Amelie, who is here today, out of school, thanks for joining, junior in high school. My name is Jumaane D. Williams and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. Thank you very much to Chair Sanchez and members of the Committee on Housing and Buildings for holding this hearing and always allowing me the opportunity to provide a statement. Our housing agencies have faced high attrition rates with HPD experiencing a 45.6 percent change from pre-pandemic to current trends. As of February 2025, HPD’s vacancy rate is 13.8 percent with a total of 382 vacancies.  HPD has bounced back from the pandemic lows with production in FY25 increasing from the low point of the previous two fiscal years. However, the vacancy rate from last month is still very high. It’s my hope HPD continues to approve prioritizing hiring to fill the gap and ensure it does not negatively impact the agency’s capacity. According to the Preliminary Mayor’s Management Report, within the first four months of FY25, HPD issued 13 percent more violations compared to the same period of FY24 for hazardous conditions including 15 percent increase for Class A non-hazardous violations, 13 percent increase for Class B hazardous violations and 11 percent increase for Class C immediately hazardous violations. In addition, HPD’s Section 8 voucher utilization rate was 89 percent in the first four months of FY25, which was a 8 percent decrease compared to FY24. The rate is much lower because of the transfer from NYCHA that saw 3,000 vouchers added to the Agency’s baseline, which in turn increased the number of vouchers issued by 26 percent. DOB faces similar staffing changes with a higher attrition rate of 68.3 percent change from pre-pandemic to current trends. As of February 2025 – I know DOB will be later, just putting on the record now – DOB’s vacancy rate is 12.41 percent with a total of 216 vacancies. Compared to HPD, DOB has been falling behind from the pandemic lows with production in FY25 being minimal compared to the previous fiscal years. It is critical that we ensure that DOB is also able to fill all its vacancies for this year. There has been a concerning trend in building safety in the past couple of years. 2023 was the deadliest year for construction workers. There were 30 construction deaths on the job, which was the most in a decade. According to the Preliminary MMR, construction-related incidents with injury decreased from 237 to 143 and construction-related injuries decreased from 266 to 146, as DOB has put several steps in place to prioritize and ensure the safety of workers. In addition, the average inspection response has been negatively impacted due to being understaffed. The average wait time for construction inspections increased to 4.2 days, plumbing inspections increased to 3.9 days, and electrical inspections increased to 9.4 days more than doubled from before I’m hoping to hear from the administration about my concerns and asks for this budget cycle:  I noticed that almost $214,000 that was set aside for the asylum seekers was removed. I’d be interested to find out where that money is going, and whether it’s possible to substitute this money for a different need for HPD. The current federal administration is dismantling agencies including HUD, and it is currently facing agency cuts and massive layoffs during a housing crisis. One department in particular that is seeing the deepest cuts is the Office of Community Planning and Development. This office funds disaster recovery and programs that help local communities build affordable housing. In addition, this office provides more than $3.6B in federal funding for rental assistance, substance use treatment, mental health, and outreach to get those living outside into housing or shelter. HPD runs an emergency housing program for people who need to be relocated because of the fires. I’d like to find out how HPD is impacted by these cuts, and whether folks are on the verge of homelessness. HUD has only one staff person for the entirety of the State of New York which has a population of approximately 20 million. What is the City planning to do to protect the federal funds and capital projects? Also, how will the City respond to a potential and probable backlog on the administration of Section 8 applications? I hope during today’s hearing the administration will provide information on the issues that I just highlighted in my statement. We cannot have unsafe and weakening infrastructure that puts New Yorkers at risk. I would like to know if the administration plans to respond to the federal government and meet the goal of being fully staffed for HPD and DOB. I’ll just end by saying a few weeks ago I was here at a public safety hearing. The only thing discussed during that public safety hearing was law enforcement. I just want to re-up the fact that all of these issues, whether education, or housing , really, really have to be a part of the public safety discussion. I hope soon, we’ll talk about it as such.

For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: Investigative encounter. The term “investigative encounter” means an interaction between a member of the department and a member of the public for a law enforcement or investigative purpose. The term does not include a casual conversation or interaction between a member of the department and a member of the public unless such conversation or interaction is based on or, in the course of such conversation or interaction, an officer develops: an objective credible reason to approach; a founded suspicion that such member of the public has engaged in or will engage in criminal activity; a reasonable suspicion that such member of the public has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime; or a reasonable cause to believe that an offense is being or has been committed. Level I encounter. The term “level I encounter” means an investigative encounter in which a member of the department requests information from a member of the public based on an objective credible reason for such encounter, and need not necessarily require any suspicion of criminal activity. Level II encounter. The term “level II encounter” means an investigative encounter in which a member of the department requests information from a member of the public based on a founded suspicion that such member of the public has engaged in or will engage in criminal activity, and during which a reasonable person would feel free to leave. Level III encounter. The term “level III encounter” means an investigative encounter in which a member of the department requests information from a member of the public based on a reasonable suspicion that such member of the public has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime, and during which a reasonable person would not feel free to leave. Use of force incident. The term “use of force incident” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision a of section 14-158. b. Within 30 days of the quarter ending September 30, 2024, and thereafter within 30 days of the end of each quarter, the department shall submit to the mayor, the public advocate and the speaker of the council and post on its website a report for the previous quarter regarding investigative encounters conducted by the department.

The apparent race/ethnicity, gender, and age of the member of the public involved in the investigative encounter; 2. The reason for the investigative encounter, including the conduct or offense or other circumstances that formed the basis for the investigative encounter; 3. Whether the investigative encounter was based on observations made by a member of the department, a response to a dispatch from a police radio, information provided by a witness, or on another basis; 4. Whether a criminal or civil summons was issued to the member of the public involved in the investigative encounter, or whether an arrest of such person was made; 5. Whether a use of force incident involving such member of the public occurred during such encounter; and 6. Whether a level III encounter with such member of the public began as a level I or level II encounter, and whether a level II encounter with such member of the public began as a level I encounter. d. The information required pursuant to this section shall be stored permanently and shall be accessible from the department’s website. The information shall be provided in a format that permits automated processing. Each report shall include a comparison of the current reporting period to the prior four reporting periods, where such information is available. § 2. This local law takes effect immediately.

No. 415-A Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2240/A.5414, which would remove the lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons and postpone jury service for any person currently incarcerated for a felony By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Restler, Cabán, Hanif, Joseph, Banks, Louis and Rivera Whereas, Pursuant to section 510 of the New York State Judiciary Law, individuals convicted of felonies are permanently disqualified from serving on a jury within the New York State Unified Court System, including courts in New York City, regardless of the seriousness of the felony or how long ago it occurred, resulting in jury disenfranchisement; and Whereas, There are constitutional bases for the responsibility of serving on a jury, such as the right to a trial by jury enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in section 2 of article I of the New York State Constitution; and Whereas, Jury service provides an opportunity for citizens to participate in the process of governing by giving them a voice in the justice system; and Whereas, Section 509 of the New York State Judiciary Law requires individualized screening of all prospective jurors to determine their qualification for jury service in the New York State Unified Court System; and Whereas, New York State law does not impose a ban on jury service relating to conduct that bears more directly than the commission of a felony on fitness to participate in a jury, like tampering with a juror in the first degree, which is a misdemeanor pursuant to section 215.25 of the New York State Penal Law; and Whereas, New York State’s lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons has a disproportionate impact on minorities, as according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2022, for example, in New York State, 45 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 51 percent of prison sentences involved Black individuals, compared to just 25 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 28 percent of prison sentences involving White individuals; and Whereas, The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the National Center for Health Statistics also reported that in 2022 in New York City, Black individuals were involved in 52 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 61 percent of prison sentences, compared to White individuals who accounted for only 9 percent of adult arrests for felonies and 5 percent of prison sentences; and Whereas, The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), a not-for-profit organization focused on advancing civil rights for New Yorkers, filed a lawsuit in December 2022 challenging the exclusion of convicted felons from Manhattan jury service and reported that between 2002 and 2019, Black individuals in Manhattan were convicted of felonies at a rate more than 21 times greater than the felony conviction rate for White individuals; and Whereas, The NYCLU additionally found in connection with filing such lawsuit that approximately 25 percent of Manhattan’s Black residents, which is approximately 38,000 people, would be otherwise eligible to serve on a jury but are instead disqualified due to a prior felony conviction; and Whereas, It is essential for New York City to safeguard its residents’ ability to participate in civic society and make the justice system fairer by reducing jury disenfranchisement that has a disproportionate impact on Black individuals in New York City, through advocating for removal of the New York State legislative ban on jury service on the basis of a previous felony conviction; and Whereas, S.2240, introduced by New York State Senator Cordell Cleare and pending in the New York State Senate, and A.5414, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Edward Gibbs and pending in the New York State Assembly, seek to remove such ban and postpone the jury service of any person serving a term of incarceration for a felony during the period of such incarceration; and Whereas, In May 2021, former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law S.830-B/A.4448-A, to grant voting rights to formerly incarcerated individuals convicted of a felony, and the enactment of S.2240/A.5414 would be a logical next step in promoting justice and the rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals after release from custody; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2240/A.5414, which would remove the lifetime ban on jury duty for convicted felons and postpone jury service for any person currently incarcerated for a felony.

No. 416 Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.3103-B/A.6058-A, to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Restler, Cabán and Hanif Whereas, Incarcerated individuals are housed in jails and prisons where they experience overcrowding, solitary confinement, routine exposure to violence, and mental trauma while disconnected from support systems such as family, friends, and other communities; and Whereas, According to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit organization advocating against mass criminalization, exposure of incarcerated individuals to violence and other common conditions in jails and prisons can exacerbate their existing mental health disorders and lead to their development of post-traumatic stress symptoms such as anxiety, depression, hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, suicidality, flashbacks, and difficulty with emotional regulation; and Whereas, The Prison Policy Initiative theorizes that incarceration can lead to post-incarceration syndrome, a syndrome similar to post-traumatic stress disorder whereby individuals continue to suffer mental health effects related to their incarceration after serving their official sentences; and Whereas, The Urban Institute, a non-profit research organization advocating for upward mobility and equity, posits that women are the fastest-growing incarcerated population in the United States and that many will experience violence, abuse, and trauma during their term of incarceration; and Whereas, According to a study conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice and Black and Pink National from 2019 to 2022 involving transgender individuals incarcerated in state prisons, transgender people are especially at risk for contact with the criminal justice system and half of the individuals surveyed reported that their mental health deteriorated during their period of incarceration; and Whereas, The Vera Institute of Justice argues that resources and treatment options within jails and prisons to help incarcerated individuals manage their mental health after release are woefully inadequate, even though according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services more than 600,000 incarcerated individuals are released from state and federal prisons each year while another 9 million incarcerated individuals cycle through local jails; and Whereas, The Prison Policy Initiative reported in 2022, based on a survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the United States Department of Justice in 2016, that over 50 percent of individuals incarcerated in state prisons reported mental health problems but only 26 percent of these individuals received mental health treatment since entering prison; and Whereas, The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) manages two prisons within New York City, Edgecombe Residential Treatment Facility in Manhattan and Queensboro Correctional Facility in Long Island City; and Whereas, S.3103-B, introduced by New York State Senator Jabari Brisport and pending in the New York State Senate, and A.6058-A, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Michaelle C. Solages and pending in the New York State Assembly, seek to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals in DOCCS custody with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration, in part involving inclusion by DOCCS of mental health reentry services in the transitional accountability plan for each person within DOCCS custody and provision by DOCCS of supportive services for incarcerated individuals upon release who received trauma intervention while in DOCCS custody; and Whereas, The New York City Council believes that the provision of adequate mental health services to individuals who have endured the traumas of incarceration is essential during and after incarceration, particularly supporting S.3103-B/A.6058-A because there are incarcerated individuals in DOCCS custody residing in state prisons located within New York City; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.3103-B/A.6058-A, to require mental health services for incarcerated individuals with mental health issues related to the trauma of incarceration.

Rose Council Member Sponsors: 11 Summary: This bill would codify the mayoral school diversity advisory group. Established in 2017, this advisory group was tasked with “working to reshape citywide policies and practices such as admissions and program planning.” The advisory group would be made up of Council appointments, a public advocate appointment, and mayoral appointments.  The advisory group would be tasked with examining factors as they relate to school diversity and would be required on an annual basis to provide a public report to the Mayor, the Speaker and The Public Advocate on increasing diversity in all schools. The annual report will also require a multi-year plan to be developed that can be adopted by DOE to address integration in schools. The report will also require a one-year look back measurement to track measurement of goals achieved.

The annual report will also require a multi-year plan to be developed that can be adopted by DOE to address integration in schools. The report will also require a one-year look back measurement to track measurement of goals achieved. This bill would codify the mayoral school diversity advisory group.

No. 333-A Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S. 28A /A. 1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age. By the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Brannan, Louis, Rivera and Banks Whereas, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a Federal law that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local government; and Whereas, To prevent employers from not hiring certain individuals based on certain characteristics, such as being a student learner or having a disability, including disabilities related to age and injury, the FLSA provides for the employment of such individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum, if an employer is issued a subminimum wage certificate by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the United States Department of Labor; and Whereas, Although the intent of the FLSA is to prevent certain workers from not receiving a job, as employers may not hire these workers if regular minimum wage laws applied, certain workers have nevertheless been unfairly treated and paid fractions of what others are paid; and Whereas, The FLSA impacts individuals with disabilities in particular, as section 14(c) of the law authorizes employers that have been issued a subminimum wage certificate to pay subminimum wages to workers who have physical or mental disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, that may affect earning or productive capacity for the job being performed; and Whereas, Wages paid by these employers are required to be commensurate with a disabled workers’ individual productivity as compared to the wage and productivity of workers who do not have disabilities performing the same type, quality, and quantity of work, but some argue that these standards are arbitrary and, oftentimes, may be skewed by an employer looking to cut costs; and Whereas, This means that workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, can be paid significantly less than other workers if an employer shows that the worker with disabilities is not as productive or efficient; and Whereas, Notably, there have been a number of instances of this happening to an extreme, including in 2013, when NBC News reported that GoodWill Industries paid their workers with disabilities as little as 22 cents an hour, and in 2018, when Vox Media reported an Illinois nonprofit paid workers with disabilities in gift cards; and Whereas , According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of May 1, 2024, 801 employers across 38 states paid subminimum wages to 40,579 workers, and a 2022-2023 report by the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations found that approximately 1,400 individuals in New York State were paid subminimum wages; and Whereas, Thus, as a result of a legal loophole in the FLSA, individuals with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, are being undervalued and unfairly compensated by employers; and Whereas, In order to ensure that these workers are protected in New York State, S. 28-A/A. 1006 have been introduced in the New York State Legislature; and Whereas, S. 28A, introduced by State Senator James Skoufis, and A.1006, introduced by State Assembly Member Phil Steck, would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age; and Whereas, This legislation would have a large impact on New York State and New York City, as both have a significant population of individuals with disabilities, with the New York State Department of Health estimating that 1 in 4 or 27% of adults in New York State have some type of disability, and the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities estimating that roughly 11% of the City’s total population have some type of disability; and Whereas, Due to the large number of individuals with disabilities, and New York State’s General Municipal Law requiring that all public bidding for contracts be awarded to the lowest possible bidder, there is incentive for employers in New York State to reduce costs and thus, contract bids, by applying for a subminimum wage certificate and paying workers with disabilities a subminimum wage; and Whereas, S. 28-A /A. 1006 would ensure that New York State workers with disabilities, including disabilities related to age or injury, receive the pay they deserve and are treated fairly; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S. 28A /A. 1006, which would eliminate the subminimum wage for employees based on their disability or age.

Wade was a landmark decision in which the Court ruled that a person may choose to have an abortion until a fetus becomes viable (usually between 24 and 28 weeks after conception), based on the right to privacy contained in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and Whereas, Nonetheless, access to abortion services has been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities, restrictions on insurance coverage, medically unnecessary regulations and many more that neither confer any health benefit nor further the safety of abortion services; and Whereas, According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 500 state laws restricting abortion have been enacted since 2011, nearly 90 percent of American counties are without a single abortion provider and five states are down to their last abortion clinic; and Whereas, The harms of abortion restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low-income, immigrants, women of color, those in the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and other marginalized or multi-marginalized groups; and Whereas, According to a study by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), individuals who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy are more likely to experience intimate partner violence, health problems, poverty, and ongoing financial distress and eviction than those who are able to access wanted abortion care; and Whereas, With a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggesting that Roe v. Wade is on the brink of being overturned in the highest court in the land, it is essential to enshrine the right to abortion access into federal law; and Whereas, S.1975, sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, and H.R. 3755, sponsored by Representative Judy Chu, also known as the Women Health Protection Act (WHPA), would protect the federal right to abortion and would block the barrage of state bans and restrictions on abortion intended to impede or outright deny access; and Whereas, The House of Representatives passed WHPA on September 24, 2021, yet the Senate has failed to move forward with the bill; and Whereas, WHPA would protect a person’s freedom to make decisions about their own reproductive health care and a health care provider’s ability to provide the full range of reproductive health services, including abortion; and Whereas, Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people regardless of race, color, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, age, or disability status, have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities; now, therefore, be it Resolved That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Senate to pass and the President to sign the Women’s Health Protection Act .

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Reports The Policy Department is responsible for developing progressive policy recommendations for city-wide issues such as pay equity, education, and affordable housing. The department monitors and evaluates the services of city agencies and forms actionable solutions to improve their functioning for the benefit of all New Yorkers.

Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries December 23rd, 2024 This report comes during the 2024 Holiday Season—a time when the influx of visitors and cold weather exerts more stress on the city’s electric grid and prompts an increase in delivery services. In addition to the surge in business, it is likely that the holiday season will also correspond with a surge in purchased e-bikes, which may be sold through discounted prices and holiday deals. "Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries," emphasizes the key policy recommendations that will mitigate this issue, allowing for a market that safely and responsibly benefits from this growing technology. Welcoming Our Newest New Yorkers: A Review February 29th, 2024 In the summer of 2022, the first bus of people seeking asylum at the southern border arrived in our city. Since then, the Office of the Public Advocate has worked to be on the ground in this effort, both welcoming and supporting migrants and asylum seekers directly and in our advocacy to the state and federal government. This review documents some of those efforts over the last year and a half, and attempts to chart a course for the next phase of the effort to provide support and safety to people in dire need, upholding both our governing and moral mandate. Out of Service: Creating an Equitable Transit System for New York City November 1st, 2023 This report seeks to outline the inequities disabled New Yorkers experience while using public transit in New York City and recommend how the city can make this system fully accessible and inclusive. It is, simply put, the right thing to do: people with disabilities have the same right to fully access city services as people without disabilities. The law also increasingly demands that barriers to full integration and engagement in public life be remedied and addressed. Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC July 11th, 2023 Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC finds shortcomings in the city’s response to the air quality emergency, and particularly with the speed and scope of public notification and harm mitigation efforts. It notes that while some alerts about potential air quality concerns were available in the days prior to the worst of the crisis, the information about health risks was neither comprehensive nor circulated widely. Additionally, measures such as the postponing of outdoor activities and the shift to remote education were announced long after the crisis was underway, rather than sufficiently in advance or shortly after the crisis started, given the warnings and risk. Improving New York City’s Responses To Individuals In Mental Health Crisis: 2022 Update November 16th, 2022 In October of 2019, the Office of the Public Advocate released "Improving New York City’s Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis,” a report outlining the state of mental health response in the city and a guide for restructuring and reforming those systems. Now in 2022, it is time to see how the City has fared in implementing our recommendations and start the conversation on further changes that are needed. Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety For New York City September 12th, 2022 Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety In New York City focuses on the numerous factors that are correlated to the increasing number of shootings in New York City. The recommendations are divided by each level of government: effective tactics from other municipalities outside of New York, the public safety 2.0 platform previously released by this office, and existing legislations at the city, state and federal level. How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing September 1st, 2022 How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing shows the striking evidence of unresolved issues that impact the lives of NYCHA residents everyday. The report focuses on various problems that all five NYCHA developments face. Towards the end of the report, our office provides recommendations that we urge are taken into consideration. Committee To End Homelessness By The Year 2026 July 28th, 2022 In winter 2020, there were nearly 80,000 people unhoused in New York City, the highest number in the city’s history. This situation is an unnecessary tragedy, and is the result of an economic system that does not support the needs of the general population of New York City residents. The system as it exists today is inhumane, flawed, wasteful, and self-perpetuating. Redefining Public Safety 2.0: Gun Violence Updates May 20th, 2022 Gun violence in our communities is a public health crisis that has been exacerbated amid the compounding public health crisis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, New York City had worked over the previous decade to bring levels of violence to historic lows, in part due to a slow transition toward holistic, community centered solutions. Disrupting The Exploitation Economy: A White Paper On Protecting Workers Classified As Independent Contractors April 21st, 2022 Independent contractors face multiple issues, from wage theft to misclassification, in their jobs. As this industry grows, risks remain for these workers. Elected officials must offer assistance and protections for these workers in light of their challenges. White Paper 2.0: Invest In Education February 17th, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic sent New York City into an unprecedented crisis, with a unique impact on students, families, educators, and school staff. Students have struggled, experienced trauma and isolation, and had their learning disrupted. As students go back to school, the city has an opportunity and a duty to ensure that its schools are equitable, safe, and supportive for every student. Reviewing The Mayor’s Housing Plan To Bolster Affordability And Equity December 3rd, 2021 When Mayor Bill De Blasio released his comprehensive housing report in 2014, I expressed my disapproval during my tenure as a Council Member, as I knew it did not go far enough. Following the Mayor’s Housing 2.0 plan, my opinion remained the same. White Paper: Equitable Pregnancy Outcomes For  Black And Brown New Yorkers November 10th, 2021 The maternal health crisis in the United States disproportionately impacts Black, and Indigenous pregnant persons, with stark disparities at the local level in New York City. This problem has significantly affected Black women, who have been more likely to die during childbirth than white women for more than a century. Why New York City Needs A Racial Equity Report To Be Part Of The Land Rezoning Process June 16th, 2021 In 1968, the Fair Housing Act was passed to protect people from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. If a person is renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities, they are protected from discrimination because of this federal law. A Renewed Deal For New York City March 11th, 2021 COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the inequities that have long plagued New York City. When we break down the data demographically, we see that while all New Yorkers have been impacted in some way, those coming from traditionally marginalized communities have been hit the hardest. White Paper: On Reimagining School Safety February 25th, 2021 The Office of the Public Advocate sees a vision for schools and community safety that centers New York City’s children and families—schools that heal and address trauma, and center on de-escalation and supportive resources. We know the main drivers of safety in communities are access to quality and well-resourced education, healthcare, and housing. Schools need to address the ways those are accessed to reimagine public safety in our schools. White Paper: In The Event Of A Second Wave November 5th, 2020 When the first reported case of COVID-19 appeared in New York, action was taken too slowly, and in some cases did not go far enough. Knowing little about how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted, how it manifested in people, and how to protect communities, New York City and New York State were slow to enforce a shutdown. A lack of preparation for an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic led to an almost immediate shortage of medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not advise all Americans to wear face masks or coverings until April. Municipalizing New York City's Electric Grid August 7th, 2020 Although Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) have been the norm in New York City for the entire history of electrification, they pose some serious disadvantages compared with municipal utilities. Continued deferral of necessary repairs, a near complete lack of transparency, and little to no true accountability has made them a liability to the people of New York City... Addressing The Underfunding of CUNY, New York's Engine of Mobility, Innovation, and Economic Support December 6th, 2019 Funding challenges threaten to stall a major engine of mobility, innovation, and economic support that the City University of New York (CUNY) represents for its students and the city of New York. For decades, New York State and New York City have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support CUNY’s mission to be a vehicle of social mobility that provides a high quality of education to all New Yorkers, regardless of their economic status, race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or ability status.... Improving New York City's Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis September 25th, 2019 This report investigates how New York City responds to individuals experiencing mental health crisis. Examining the flaws in current protocols and the best practices of approaches applied in other cities, it presents a framework for an improved response system that would provide those in crisis with the services that they need and minimize the negative outcomes that are currently far too common.

Worst Landlord Watchlist Latest Press April 8th, 2025 Press Release April 8th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Condemns The Mayor Commending ICE "Mayor Adams offered a ' Hats Off' to ICE and Kristi Noem today as they have ripped families from homes, students from streets, and mistakenly sent people like Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to a horrific prison in El Salvador. At least now we know the so-called “independent” mayor’s hat is now MAGA-red by choice. “Like so much of the mayor’s conduct, this is a disgrace. This has never been about criminality or 'illegality.' While families are being swept up in Sackets Harbor and student activists are being abducted at Columbia and elsewhere, Mayor Adams is more interested in scolding the media, misleading New Yorkers, and falsely re-litigating the last few years than in dealing with the real inhumanity and danger of the moment. “No matter what he claims, the mayor is neither a messiah nor a martyr. And it is clear he is only interested in defending himself and Donald Trump, not New Yorkers. It’s up to the rest of us to stand with our neighbors – as they did in Sackets Harbor – and stand up to irresponsible, harmful leaders.” Get Help!

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Worst Landlord Watchlist Latest Press April 8th, 2025 Press Release April 8th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Condemns The Mayor Commending ICE "Mayor Adams offered a ' Hats Off' to ICE and Kristi Noem today as they have ripped families from homes, students from streets, and mistakenly sent people like Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to a horrific prison in El Salvador. At least now we know the so-called “independent” mayor’s hat is now MAGA-red by choice. “Like so much of the mayor’s conduct, this is a disgrace. This has never been about criminality or 'illegality.' While families are being swept up in Sackets Harbor and student activists are being abducted at Columbia and elsewhere, Mayor Adams is more interested in scolding the media, misleading New Yorkers, and falsely re-litigating the last few years than in dealing with the real inhumanity and danger of the moment. “No matter what he claims, the mayor is neither a messiah nor a martyr. And it is clear he is only interested in defending himself and Donald Trump, not New Yorkers. It’s up to the rest of us to stand with our neighbors – as they did in Sackets Harbor – and stand up to irresponsible, harmful leaders.” Get Help!

Type: Introduction Status: Enacted Committee: Committee on Civil and Human Rights On agenda: 12/20/2018 Enactment date: 1/10/2021 Law number: 2021/004 Title: A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting discrimination based on one's arrest record, pending criminal accusations or criminal convictions Sponsors: Public Advocate Jumaane Williams , Adrienne E. Adams , Brad S. Lander , Daniel Dromm , Helen K. Rosenthal , Ben Kallos , Carlos Menchaca , Antonio Reynoso , Diana I. Ayala , James G. Van Bramer , Carlina Rivera , (by request of the Mayor) Council Member Sponsors: 11 Summary: This bill would extend employment protections for individuals with pending adjournments in contemplation of dismissal (ACDs) and convictions for violations prior to sealing by adding unsealed violations and ACDs to the category of dispositions that may never be considered for the purpose of making employment-related decisions. The bill also prohibits discrimination in licensing against applicants with convictions for violations, even prior to sealing. Additionally, this bill would clarify protections for applicants and employees with pending criminal cases by explicitly requiring an employer to make an individualized assessment of the relationship between the charged conduct and the job, much like what is required for consideration of an individual’s conviction history.

The bill also prohibits discrimination in licensing against applicants with convictions for violations, even prior to sealing. Additionally, this bill would clarify protections for applicants and employees with pending criminal cases by explicitly requiring an employer to make an individualized assessment of the relationship between the charged conduct and the job, much like what is required for consideration of an individual’s conviction history.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all.

She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.

Last name: Riley E-mail: District12@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-12/ Notes: District 12 - Council Member - Democrat  - Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Co-op City - New York City - Kevin Christopher Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York.  While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal.  Prior to being elected to represent the New York City Council’s 12th district, Kevin worked for the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Carl E. Heastie.  For over a decade, he worked directly with community groups and organizations as well as pertinent leaders across New York City. This is where his passion was born, this is where he gained the courage to run for City Council.  Kevin has been no stranger to hard work or mentorship. Not only has he had mentors throughout his career, he has also dedicated his down time to generating positive relationships with the youth. Working for the New York Foundling as a Skills Coach is where he witnessed how much mentorship can impact your growth and overall confidence. As a skills coach, he mentored young men, educating them on life skills and making them cognizant of their social surroundings. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s, My Brother’s Keeper initiative.  In 2019, he founded a non-profit organization, Music Over Violence, which seeks to address violence and social injustice within his community. Another endeavor undertaken by Kevin, in conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers, is the founding of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives.  As the father of two beautiful daughters, Kevin C. Riley is a leader who is committed to making his community better for future generations. Councilman Riley currently represents the 12th City Council District covering the areas of Wakefield, Baychester, Eastchester, Olinville, Co-op City, Edenwald, and Williamsbridge in the Northeast section of the Bronx.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother. For nearly a decade, Sandy has been working in Bushwick and supporting projects in East New York that empower women and young people of color. Most of her work has been dedicated to ending white supremacy, fighting for a transition away from the fossil fuel economy, and demanding our public agencies and servants are accountable to the people, not corporations.  Through years of strong community partnerships and collaborations, Sandy has built neighborhood institutions that directly strengthen grassroots movements in Bushwick and East New York. She has committed her life to addressing issues through direct interventions and solutions including building farms in our food deserts, creating jobs where we have high unemployment, and helping develop community space where it was scarce.  As the new City Council Member, she will fight to keep people in their homes, create protections for our immigrant neighbors, and help to build a healthy, sustainable future.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.  Lincoln grew up in Brooklyn Heights and lives in Greenpoint with his partner. He graduated from Brown University and attended neighborhood schools.

Before her election to City Council, Alexa’s career spanned almost three decades in the not-for-profit and philanthropic sectors. Most recently, Alexa served as Program Director at the Scherman Foundation, where she supported local and national social justice organizations that included work to protect human rights, autonomy, and dignity of all people. She has supported state and national efforts to reduce the incarceration of juveniles and adults, fought discrimination across multiple government systems, and supported the empowerment of marginalized communities.  For nearly a decade, Alexa also served as PTA President at PS 172, partnering with parents, staff and students to improve academic and recreational programs. She championed language access and an inclusive and supportive community for all. She has had the privilege of serving on multiple local and national nonprofit boards including Brooklyn Community Board 7 and as Chair of the NYC Youth Board.

Last name: Ayala E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence. She is a partner with the people, and a strong voice and aggressive champion for what she believes in.  Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

Amanda is a lifelong Bronxite, born and raised in Soundview as a second-generation Afro-Latina of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent. She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours learning to dance and summers at camp in Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. Soon after graduate school, she started her career by fighting voter suppression and mobilizing Black and Latino communities for President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus and a districtwide Participatory Budgeting process. After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx. Amanda’s programming and partnerships with CUNY, labor unions, and local community-based organizations have allowed her to create new opportunities for young Bronxites to access trade jobs. During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Amanda created a pipeline for more women to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.  During the height of the pandemic Amanda became active in mutual aid and feels most in her element when in community. Hosting food distributions for neighbors has been at the core of her service to continue the fight against food insecurity and The Bronx being the unhealthiest county in NYS.  She was elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021. Amanda currently resides in Parkchester with her dog and cat.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

As a dedicated single teen mother, she works hard to create a sustainable future for her child and for all children and families who live in under-resourced neighborhoods.  Althea began her career in civic service more than 15 years ago working for non-profit agencies and community centers that focused on giving a voice to the most vulnerable populations. She organized voting rights information sessions, led strategy workshops to address gang policing and created annual youth forums and community celebrations to bridge relationships between residents and neighborhood partners. Each step of the way, Althea’s natural leadership and organizing skills were honed while advocating for families, seniors, young adults and students on important issues, while identifying and allocating much needed resources to neighborhoods of the Bronx.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

Last name: De La Rosa E-mail: District10@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/carmen-de-la-rosa/ Notes: District 10 - Council Member - Democrat - Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill - Carmen De La Rosa immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood where she has lived her entire life. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government.  In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent her community as the State Assembly Member of the 72nd District. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice.  As a progressive Democrat, Carmen has fought for criminal justice reform, workers’ rights, truly affordable housing and protections for tenants, climate justice, taxing the wealthy, LGBTIA rights, and many other consequential social justice policies.  She successfully negotiated and passed the New York State DREAM ACT and the first in the nation Excluded Workers Fund (EWF) at $2.1 Billion. As the member of the Assembly representing the district with the highest number of rent-stabilized apartments, Carmen actively participated in passing the strongest tenant protection laws in a generation.  On June 22nd, 2021, Carmen was victorious in the Democratic primary and subsequently won the general election on November 2nd, becoming the first Dominican woman elected to represent District 10 at City Hall.  Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses.  Carmen De La Rosa is committed to building a community-driven government rooted in the principles of co-governance and participatory democracy. Working alongside the community she is committed to improving the lives of residents in the community.  Carmen is proudly Mia’s Mom and along with her husband Jose, they are raising their daughter in the community where her parents also reside. As a proud product of uptown, Carmen looks forward to continuing to serve the community she loves and the community that helped raise her.

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

The Exonerated Five spent between seven to 13 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit, until their sentences were overturned in 2002.

Over the past two decades, Yusef has become a family man, father, poet, activist and inspirational speaker. He continues to utilize his platform to share his story with others and educate the public about the impact of mass incarceration and police brutality rooted in our justice system. He regularly advocates for criminal justice reform, prison reform and the abolition of juvenile solitary confinement and capital punishment.  Yusef was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (2014) and is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama (2016).

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room April 9th, 2025 Press Release April 9th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Adams Administration Inviting ICE to Rikers "The idea that Mayor Adams was recused from this decision is laughable. The deal was made a month ago, in the mayor’s agreement with ICE. His weak attempt to insulate himself from criticism for doing the Trump administration’s bidding is transparently ridiculous, and New Yorkers will see through it. "The truth is that the mayor has long looked for every opportunity to expand collaboration with ICE – whether it was his own position or Donald Trump’s. By misleading the public about our sanctuary policies, he’s attempting to make it more acceptable to chip away at them and deport more immigrant New Yorkers, regardless of criminality or 'illegality.' This mayor has already demonstrated a willingness to ignore laws he doesn’t like, especially on Rikers, and this latest example is nothing more than an attempt to aid the Trump deportation machine that rips immigrant families from their homes and students from their campuses." The Public Advocate will hold a virtual media availability at 1:00 PM today to further discuss this issue. Reporters can join by registering here .

No matter what he’ll now claim, this isn’t a testament to his innocence, but to his capitulation and fear. "Judge Ho may have refunded the sale today, but Mayor Adams still sold out New York in the first place – and would unapologetically do so again and again. We’ll soon find out if his refusal to stand up to Donald Trump was because he was afraid, or because he agreed with him. "Prosecutors Danielle Sassoon, Hagan Scotten, First Deputy Torres-Springer and Deputy Mayors Parker, Joshi, and Williams-Isom are just some of the people who resigned because the mayor hasn’t cared enough about the city to do so himself. Based on the judge's own words, how can New Yorkers ever believe that the mayor won't continue to put his own interests above the best interests of our city?" March 29th, 2025 Press Release March 29th, 2025 Press Release NYC PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S STATEMENT ON EID AL-FITR "Eid Mubarak to all New Yorkers celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan. "Today as we celebrate Eid al-Fitr, we recognize the spirit that has defined this past month. I’ve been honored to join in many iftars and observances this year, and have been inspired and grounded by the resilience, resolve, generosity of our Muslim neighbors—values that extend far beyond today’s celebrations. "I know that for many in the Muslim community, this time of joy is also met with uncertainty and pain – with suffering abroad and threats at home challenging basic identity and ideals. In moments of crisis, we must reaffirm our shared commitment—to combating Islamophobia and hatred, to advocating for justice, and to building a city where every New Yorker feels safe and seen. "The lessons of Ramadan are universal. They remind us that our strength is greatest when it is shared. I pray that Eid brings you peace, blessings, and light, today and always." March 27th, 2025 Press Release March 27th, 2025 Press Release Emergency For Emergency Responders: NYC Public Advocate Calls On NYPD To Provide 911 Operators And Dispatchers With Safe Conditions And Staffing New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams today called for urgent action to address a looming emergency for emergency responders. 911 operators and dispatchers are facing untenable, unacceptable working conditions and staff shortages that could threaten the city’s emergency response systems if not addressed immediately. The Public Advocate recently raised these issues to NYPD Commissioner Tisch, and joined workers at a press conference outside 1 Police Plaza today to further discuss the urgent issues. “We have an emergency coming for our emergency responders – and there’s no one left for them to call,” said Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams . “Without fair conditions and benefits, an end to punitive forced overtime, and sufficient training and staffing, we could be heading for a crisis with no one on the other end of the line. This is a core public safety issue – we need fast emergency response. That means we need more responders, more experienced operators, and support for the trauma of the people supporting New Yorkers in traumatic moments.” 911 dispatchers and operators, members of DC37 Local 5911, report being routinely subject to unworkable conditions, including mandatory overtime under threat of penalty, with some workers unable to go home between 16-hour shifts and needing instead to sleep in the facilities. Despite the traumatic work they are engaged in on a regular basis, NYC’s Police Communications Technicians and Supervisors are considered clerical workers, and so not able to access mental health resources. As a result of these and other conditions, as well as pay that is not commensurate with the challenges of the work, staffing levels are alarmingly low and turnover is alarmingly high.  

In a letter to NYPD Commissioner Tisch, the Public Advocate documented serious issues and potential exploitative actions that workers have reported including: Punitive measures - including docking pay - for an inability to work forced overtime 16-hour mandatory overtime shifts several days a week Employees sleeping in locker room facilities due to time and financial constraints A lack of adequate mental health resources despite the trauma inherent in the work Hearing and vision loss due to inadequate equipment and poor facility conditions. To address these issues, the Public Advocate demanded the NYPD answer the following questions: Does the NYPD believe staffing to be adequate to successfully maintain the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? What are the overtime statistics compared to other divisions within the NYPD? What are the absenteeism rates compared to other divisions within the NYPD? What is the current retention rate, and how does it compare to the rate of vacancies filled? What strategies, if any, have proven successful in retaining staff? What contingency plans are in place if the system were to be overwhelmed? What specific measures are being considered to improve staff working conditions and overall well-being? What previous efforts to address these issues have been attempted, and why were they unsuccessful? If 100% of the funds from surcharges were redirected to 911 operations, how would you suggest they be used to strengthen operations? The dedication of Local 5911 workers is deep, but the consequences of a failure to address this crisis are dire. Read the full letter from the Public Advocate here . March 25th, 2025 Press Release March 25th, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Argues To Strengthen Housing Protections Against Federal Budget Cuts Amid an ongoing effort by the federal government to reduce the budgets and effectiveness of federal housing programs, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. WIlliams pushed for the staffing and strengthening of municipal housing agencies. At a budget hearing of the Committee on Housing and Buildings, he argued that the safety of tenants and tradesmen alike depends on safe staffing levels and robust funding for inspection and infrastructure. “We cannot have unsafe and weakening infrastructure that puts New Yorkers at risk,” declared the Public Advocate. “I would like to know if the administration plans to respond to the federal government and meet the goal of being fully staffed for HPD and DOB.” This comes as City Hall and city agencies have been reluctant to criticize the actions of the Trump administration that negatively affect the lives of New Yorkers. As to the municipal budget and city administration, Public Advocate Williams noted that the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) currently has 382 open positions, a vacancy rate of 13.8 percent, and the Department of Buildings has over 200 vacant positions. He further highlighted the direct dangers of underfunding and understaffing, both to tenants and workers. There were 30 construction-related deaths on the job in 2023, the most in a decade, and that for DOB “... The average inspection response has been negatively impacted due to being understaffed. The average wait time for construction inspections increased to 4.2 days, plumbing inspections increased to 3.9 days, and electrical inspections increased to 9.4 days more than doubled from before.” In the face of federal cuts, the Public Advocate  asked “What is the City planning to do to protect the federal funds and capital projects? Also, how will the City respond to a potential and probable backlog on the administration of Section 8 applications?” The Public Advocate’s full comments as-delivered are below, and video is available here. STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND BUILDINGS MARCH 25, 2025 Thank you very much, Madame Chair. I just want to congratulate the Acting Commissioner, congratulations, couldn’t happen to a nicer, more attentive guy, so I appreciate that. And I want to shout out my 16 year old, Amelie, who is here today, out of school, thanks for joining, junior in high school. My name is Jumaane D. Williams and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. Thank you very much to Chair Sanchez and members of the Committee on Housing and Buildings for holding this hearing and always allowing me the opportunity to provide a statement. Our housing agencies have faced high attrition rates with HPD experiencing a 45.6 percent change from pre-pandemic to current trends. As of February 2025, HPD’s vacancy rate is 13.8 percent with a total of 382 vacancies.  HPD has bounced back from the pandemic lows with production in FY25 increasing from the low point of the previous two fiscal years. However, the vacancy rate from last month is still very high. It’s my hope HPD continues to approve prioritizing hiring to fill the gap and ensure it does not negatively impact the agency’s capacity. According to the Preliminary Mayor’s Management Report, within the first four months of FY25, HPD issued 13 percent more violations compared to the same period of FY24 for hazardous conditions including 15 percent increase for Class A non-hazardous violations, 13 percent increase for Class B hazardous violations and 11 percent increase for Class C immediately hazardous violations. In addition, HPD’s Section 8 voucher utilization rate was 89 percent in the first four months of FY25, which was a 8 percent decrease compared to FY24. The rate is much lower because of the transfer from NYCHA that saw 3,000 vouchers added to the Agency’s baseline, which in turn increased the number of vouchers issued by 26 percent. DOB faces similar staffing changes with a higher attrition rate of 68.3 percent change from pre-pandemic to current trends. As of February 2025 – I know DOB will be later, just putting on the record now – DOB’s vacancy rate is 12.41 percent with a total of 216 vacancies. Compared to HPD, DOB has been falling behind from the pandemic lows with production in FY25 being minimal compared to the previous fiscal years. It is critical that we ensure that DOB is also able to fill all its vacancies for this year. There has been a concerning trend in building safety in the past couple of years. 2023 was the deadliest year for construction workers. There were 30 construction deaths on the job, which was the most in a decade. According to the Preliminary MMR, construction-related incidents with injury decreased from 237 to 143 and construction-related injuries decreased from 266 to 146, as DOB has put several steps in place to prioritize and ensure the safety of workers. In addition, the average inspection response has been negatively impacted due to being understaffed. The average wait time for construction inspections increased to 4.2 days, plumbing inspections increased to 3.9 days, and electrical inspections increased to 9.4 days more than doubled from before I’m hoping to hear from the administration about my concerns and asks for this budget cycle:  I noticed that almost $214,000 that was set aside for the asylum seekers was removed. I’d be interested to find out where that money is going, and whether it’s possible to substitute this money for a different need for HPD. The current federal administration is dismantling agencies including HUD, and it is currently facing agency cuts and massive layoffs during a housing crisis. One department in particular that is seeing the deepest cuts is the Office of Community Planning and Development. This office funds disaster recovery and programs that help local communities build affordable housing. In addition, this office provides more than $3.6B in federal funding for rental assistance, substance use treatment, mental health, and outreach to get those living outside into housing or shelter. HPD runs an emergency housing program for people who need to be relocated because of the fires. I’d like to find out how HPD is impacted by these cuts, and whether folks are on the verge of homelessness. HUD has only one staff person for the entirety of the State of New York which has a population of approximately 20 million. What is the City planning to do to protect the federal funds and capital projects? Also, how will the City respond to a potential and probable backlog on the administration of Section 8 applications? I hope during today’s hearing the administration will provide information on the issues that I just highlighted in my statement. We cannot have unsafe and weakening infrastructure that puts New Yorkers at risk. I would like to know if the administration plans to respond to the federal government and meet the goal of being fully staffed for HPD and DOB. I’ll just end by saying a few weeks ago I was here at a public safety hearing. The only thing discussed during that public safety hearing was law enforcement. I just want to re-up the fact that all of these issues, whether education, or housing , really, really have to be a part of the public safety discussion. I hope soon, we’ll talk about it as such.

Reports The Policy Department is responsible for developing progressive policy recommendations for city-wide issues such as pay equity, education, and affordable housing. The department monitors and evaluates the services of city agencies and forms actionable solutions to improve their functioning for the benefit of all New Yorkers.

Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries December 23rd, 2024 This report comes during the 2024 Holiday Season—a time when the influx of visitors and cold weather exerts more stress on the city’s electric grid and prompts an increase in delivery services. In addition to the surge in business, it is likely that the holiday season will also correspond with a surge in purchased e-bikes, which may be sold through discounted prices and holiday deals. "Stopping the Blaze: Solutions for Safe Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries," emphasizes the key policy recommendations that will mitigate this issue, allowing for a market that safely and responsibly benefits from this growing technology. Welcoming Our Newest New Yorkers: A Review February 29th, 2024 In the summer of 2022, the first bus of people seeking asylum at the southern border arrived in our city. Since then, the Office of the Public Advocate has worked to be on the ground in this effort, both welcoming and supporting migrants and asylum seekers directly and in our advocacy to the state and federal government. This review documents some of those efforts over the last year and a half, and attempts to chart a course for the next phase of the effort to provide support and safety to people in dire need, upholding both our governing and moral mandate. Out of Service: Creating an Equitable Transit System for New York City November 1st, 2023 This report seeks to outline the inequities disabled New Yorkers experience while using public transit in New York City and recommend how the city can make this system fully accessible and inclusive. It is, simply put, the right thing to do: people with disabilities have the same right to fully access city services as people without disabilities. The law also increasingly demands that barriers to full integration and engagement in public life be remedied and addressed. Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC July 11th, 2023 Orange Sky, Red Alert: A Review of Air Quality Emergencies in NYC finds shortcomings in the city’s response to the air quality emergency, and particularly with the speed and scope of public notification and harm mitigation efforts. It notes that while some alerts about potential air quality concerns were available in the days prior to the worst of the crisis, the information about health risks was neither comprehensive nor circulated widely. Additionally, measures such as the postponing of outdoor activities and the shift to remote education were announced long after the crisis was underway, rather than sufficiently in advance or shortly after the crisis started, given the warnings and risk. Improving New York City’s Responses To Individuals In Mental Health Crisis: 2022 Update November 16th, 2022 In October of 2019, the Office of the Public Advocate released "Improving New York City’s Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis,” a report outlining the state of mental health response in the city and a guide for restructuring and reforming those systems. Now in 2022, it is time to see how the City has fared in implementing our recommendations and start the conversation on further changes that are needed. Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety For New York City September 12th, 2022 Reimagining Gun Violence Prevention And Public Safety In New York City focuses on the numerous factors that are correlated to the increasing number of shootings in New York City. The recommendations are divided by each level of government: effective tactics from other municipalities outside of New York, the public safety 2.0 platform previously released by this office, and existing legislations at the city, state and federal level. How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing September 1st, 2022 How The Other Half Lives In Public Housing shows the striking evidence of unresolved issues that impact the lives of NYCHA residents everyday. The report focuses on various problems that all five NYCHA developments face. Towards the end of the report, our office provides recommendations that we urge are taken into consideration. Committee To End Homelessness By The Year 2026 July 28th, 2022 In winter 2020, there were nearly 80,000 people unhoused in New York City, the highest number in the city’s history. This situation is an unnecessary tragedy, and is the result of an economic system that does not support the needs of the general population of New York City residents. The system as it exists today is inhumane, flawed, wasteful, and self-perpetuating. Redefining Public Safety 2.0: Gun Violence Updates May 20th, 2022 Gun violence in our communities is a public health crisis that has been exacerbated amid the compounding public health crisis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, New York City had worked over the previous decade to bring levels of violence to historic lows, in part due to a slow transition toward holistic, community centered solutions. Disrupting The Exploitation Economy: A White Paper On Protecting Workers Classified As Independent Contractors April 21st, 2022 Independent contractors face multiple issues, from wage theft to misclassification, in their jobs. As this industry grows, risks remain for these workers. Elected officials must offer assistance and protections for these workers in light of their challenges. White Paper 2.0: Invest In Education February 17th, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic sent New York City into an unprecedented crisis, with a unique impact on students, families, educators, and school staff. Students have struggled, experienced trauma and isolation, and had their learning disrupted. As students go back to school, the city has an opportunity and a duty to ensure that its schools are equitable, safe, and supportive for every student. Reviewing The Mayor’s Housing Plan To Bolster Affordability And Equity December 3rd, 2021 When Mayor Bill De Blasio released his comprehensive housing report in 2014, I expressed my disapproval during my tenure as a Council Member, as I knew it did not go far enough. Following the Mayor’s Housing 2.0 plan, my opinion remained the same. White Paper: Equitable Pregnancy Outcomes For  Black And Brown New Yorkers November 10th, 2021 The maternal health crisis in the United States disproportionately impacts Black, and Indigenous pregnant persons, with stark disparities at the local level in New York City. This problem has significantly affected Black women, who have been more likely to die during childbirth than white women for more than a century. Why New York City Needs A Racial Equity Report To Be Part Of The Land Rezoning Process June 16th, 2021 In 1968, the Fair Housing Act was passed to protect people from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. If a person is renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities, they are protected from discrimination because of this federal law. A Renewed Deal For New York City March 11th, 2021 COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the inequities that have long plagued New York City. When we break down the data demographically, we see that while all New Yorkers have been impacted in some way, those coming from traditionally marginalized communities have been hit the hardest. White Paper: On Reimagining School Safety February 25th, 2021 The Office of the Public Advocate sees a vision for schools and community safety that centers New York City’s children and families—schools that heal and address trauma, and center on de-escalation and supportive resources. We know the main drivers of safety in communities are access to quality and well-resourced education, healthcare, and housing. Schools need to address the ways those are accessed to reimagine public safety in our schools. White Paper: In The Event Of A Second Wave November 5th, 2020 When the first reported case of COVID-19 appeared in New York, action was taken too slowly, and in some cases did not go far enough. Knowing little about how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted, how it manifested in people, and how to protect communities, New York City and New York State were slow to enforce a shutdown. A lack of preparation for an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic led to an almost immediate shortage of medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not advise all Americans to wear face masks or coverings until April. Municipalizing New York City's Electric Grid August 7th, 2020 Although Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) have been the norm in New York City for the entire history of electrification, they pose some serious disadvantages compared with municipal utilities. Continued deferral of necessary repairs, a near complete lack of transparency, and little to no true accountability has made them a liability to the people of New York City... Addressing The Underfunding of CUNY, New York's Engine of Mobility, Innovation, and Economic Support December 6th, 2019 Funding challenges threaten to stall a major engine of mobility, innovation, and economic support that the City University of New York (CUNY) represents for its students and the city of New York. For decades, New York State and New York City have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support CUNY’s mission to be a vehicle of social mobility that provides a high quality of education to all New Yorkers, regardless of their economic status, race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or ability status.... Improving New York City's Responses to Individuals in Mental Health Crisis September 25th, 2019 This report investigates how New York City responds to individuals experiencing mental health crisis. Examining the flaws in current protocols and the best practices of approaches applied in other cities, it presents a framework for an improved response system that would provide those in crisis with the services that they need and minimize the negative outcomes that are currently far too common.

I will prioritize the codification of Roe v Wade in New York State Law, and will work to elect a Democratic-led State Senate that will finally make that happen. Criminal Justice Reform I will do everything in my power to end mass incarceration and the unequal treatment of people of color in our criminal justice system.  Real changes can be made at the State level, including ending cash bail, sentencing reform, providing more mental health services and drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration, and many others. Environmental Protection NYS must have a focused and comprehensive approach to fighting climate change and conserving our natural environment.  This should include building green and investing in public transportation in our urban areas, conserving more land across the state, protecting our clean water and public health by prohibiting harmful activity in key areas of the State, and divesting from the fossil fuel industry. Gun Violence Prevention I have chaired the NYC Council task force to Combat Gun Violence and founded the National Network to Combat Gun Violence, finding effective solutions and implementing real changes in our communities.  My opponent has received an A rating from the NRA. As LG, I will continue to be a bold voice and leader on gun reform in New York State and Nationally. LGBTQ Rights I believe that we must continue to fight for equality for LGBTQ individuals.  I believe in marriage equality and publically supported the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage in 2015. As LG I will use every tool at my disposal to advocate for equal rights for those who identify as part of the LGBT community. Women’s Equality I will prioritize legislation and action that promotes safe working environments for women, equal pay for equal work, and equal representation in Elected positions, government, and board rooms.  I will support programs that give women more economic and educational opportunity, and I will advocate for the passage of laws that help prevent domestic and sexual abuse. Stopping ICE and Protecting Families I have proudly been arrested while standing up against Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation forces.  We cannot let right wing, racist actions tear apart the families our friends and neighbors. The hard-working immigrants who are part of the fabric of our communities must feel safe in their homes and be able to go to their jobs, schools, and government offices without fear. Equality in Education We must improve the quality of public education for students across all of NYS with a focus on ending the practice of chronically underfunding public schools that serve people of color and immigrant communities.  As LG I will draw attention to this inequality, advocate for resources, and support our teachers. Fair and Affordable Housing As a full time tenant advocate and Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Housing and Buildings, I have fought for tenants’ and homeowners’ rights my entire career.  Across our entire State we must create more affordable housing, protect rent stabilization and the rights of tenants, promote sensible zoning, and make home ownership more accessible and affordable. Voting Rights New York State lags behind much of the nation in our archaic voting laws and we must do everything that we can to protect and expand voting rights.  I support the creation of an early voting period, same-day voter registration, automatic voter registration, and investment in poll worker training. Health Care The health care system in our country is complicated, but our basic values should not be. I believe that every single individual who resides in our country should have access to the health care they need at a cost they can afford.  I will work with our State leaders to resist health care cuts coming out of Washington and ensure that all New Yorkers are provided with affordable, universal, access to the care that they need. Legalizing Marijuana We must expand out medical marijuana program to include all those who can benefit from its use.  We also should rapidly move towards the full legalization of marijuana that has been massively successful in other states, expunge the State criminal records of past users, and create a pathway for all New Yorkers to benefit economically from this industry, not just a select few chosen by the Governor. Organized Labor Strong Labor organizations in New York State are crucial in ensuring that all workers, not just their members, have safe working conditions, fair treatment from employers, livable wages, and basic benefits.  I will fight against National or local efforts to diminish a workers’ right to join a union, and a union’s ability to advocate for all workers. I support more vocational and apprenticeship training programs for our youth, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities.

Click "show" on the boxes below for more information about his positions. [9] "Council Member Williams is a proud product of Brooklyn’s public school system, from pre-school through his Master’s degree at Brooklyn College. He believes that our public schools are a jewel that needs to be polished in order for every New Yorker to reach their potential. As a Council Member, Jumaane has funded millions of dollars in improvements to his schools in the 45th District, including enhancements to classroom technology and upgrades to building infrastructure and services. When flooding created problems at IS 285, he raised media attention in order to successfully bring City agencies together and solve the issue. He has also provided for creative programming to local students, including over $100,000 a year through the Cultural After School Arts (CASA) initiative, as well as unique educational opportunities to stimulate cross-cultural dialogue; in April 2013, he brought high school students from Brooklyn College Academy and the Yeshivah of Flatbush together in lower Manhattan to learn about genocide and share their experiences with discrimination. Jumaane is a big supporter of Beacon programs, the Summer Youth Employment Program and other enrichment opportunities for young people, advocating on their behalf as a member of the Council’s Committee on Youth Services and making his yearly vote on the City budget contingent on their funding. Jumaane has been an opponent of mayoral control of schools, citing the lack of parent involvement and the failure in closing the achievement gap for students of more color and those with disabilities. He understands the importance of these issues intimately, having been a student with Tourette’s syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who had the support of family and teachers in order to succeed. Going forward, he believes a municipal model, which would incorporate greater oversight from the City Council, would be more effective in addressing local concerns and increasing accountability. Jumaane feels the charter school system, intended to be a laboratory for innovation to bring to public schools, has thus far been misused and is opposed to the forced school co-location and closure policy that has dominated the last decade. Locally, he has successfully fought back against a proposed co-location at IS 240 and is working with parents, students and teachers on a similar effort at the Tilden Educational Campus. Jumaane has also been an active supporter of his local parochial schools, helping to rally support to save institutions like Nazareth Regional High School from closure. Additionally, Jumaane is an advocate for reducing class sizes and the impact of testing in the classroom. He believes that specialized high schools, such as the one he attended at Brooklyn Tech, should find a solution that fully and fairly assesses every applicant’s abilities in order to ensure fairness. He has fought for ample resources at his local libraries, including successfully lobbying to have full-service trailers provided to the community during the renovation of Rugby Library, which he funded. Jumaane has also been particularly attentive to the needs of his alma mater Brooklyn College and the rest of the City University of New York system, supporting increased funding as a member of the Council’s Committee on Higher Education."

"As a founding member of the Council’s Progressive Caucus, Council Member Williams has helped lead the fight to change the way government serves the people of New York City. By increasing citizen participation and advancing transparency, he believes that New Yorkers will be empowered to better advocate for their communities and to demand greater efficiency and more equitable resource allocation. In 2011, Jumaane became one of the first Council Members in New York City to implement participatory budgeting, a transformational approach to government that engages residents in the process of designing and voting on projects to better their community. Thus far, he has allocated over $2 million in capital funding based on his constituents’ votes, which will go to projects ranging from security cameras, street improvements for senior citizens, park lighting and a college and career resource center. Jumaane has also changed how non-profit organizations serve the district through results-based accountability, an approach to ensure best practices are used to achieve results, increase accountability and increase the return on investment for taxpayers. In October 2012, Jumaane was the lead sponsor of Resolution 1540, which requires Council Speakers to establish a policy that ensures the integrity and transparency of the discretionary funding process. He believes codifying this rule was a key step in transparency and fairness, and he will work towards further improvements that ensure the needs of communities across New York City are equitably met by government. One of these efforts began in February 2013, when Jumaane introduced a series of proposed amendments to the New York City Charter that would address the problems with transparency and parity in the budget process, as well as the imbalance of power between the executive and legislative branches. He has asked all mayoral candidates to formally commit to these reforms. Jumaane has been vocal in his concerns over the way elections are conducted in New York City, including the wait times that he feels have disenfranchised many potential voters. He was a leading voice that successfully lobbied Governor Cuomo to issue an executive order that eased voting for those affected by Hurricane Sandy in advance of the November 2012 general election, and he also helped get the Board of Elections to increase ballot font size and better inform voters of poll site changes following the September 2012 primary election. Jumaane has joined the call for a reform agenda that would address issues with voter registration, ballot design, poll worker training and language access, particularly for the growing Haitian population. Additionally, he is a supporter of instituting early voting and no-excuse absentee voting options. Government’s approach to contracts has also been a focus of needed reform for Jumaane. He believes that an overemphasis on outside consultants have contributed to cost overruns in city programs and mismanagement of projects like CityTime. He has stood by the labor community as they seek fair contracts with the City, standing with the bus drivers in their early 2013 strike and supporting the call to address back pay in future negotiations. Jumaane has also been a leading voice in the City Council on reforming contracting to minority and women-owned business enterprises, co-writing a report in September 2010 on how Local Law 129 of 2005 has fallen short of meeting its own goals; some of the report’s recommendations were incorporated into Local Law 1 of 2013."

"The needs of homeowners and tenants are something Council Member Williams understands intimately, having built his young career of advocating for their needs. As a member of the Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, he has brought his experience to continue the hard work on these issues. The lack of affordable housing across the city is a growing crisis, and Jumaane has been on the frontlines to protect rent regulation and to call for essential reforms that will keep New Yorkers in their communities. In June 2011, he allocated $250,000 of his capital budget towards the construction of Crystal Towers, a project that will bring reasonably priced units to Flatbush. He believes a fundamental reorganization of the Rent Guidelines Board is needed to ensure the voice of tenants is properly weighed. For years, he has advocated for the repeal of the Urstadt Law, which would bring home rule on housing policy from Albany back to New York City and allow local legislators to address problems such as landlord abuse of high income and vacancy decontrol. Jumaane has hosted numerous housing forums and office hours to connect property owners to City agencies and empower them with information on their legal rights. He has been deeply involved in the transformation of conditions at Flatbush Gardens, from rallying against the lockout of workouts and poor living conditions to working with new management in an effort to bring resources to residents.  He is a strong supporter of local block associations and civic associations, assisting them with beautification projects and helping to make neighborhood conditions safer. When Jumaane joined with the Nieuw Amersfort Civic Association to highlight a blighted house on East 40th Street, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development promptly committed to tear down the unsafe structure. He is also a big advocate for public housing, funding thousands of dollars towards programs at Glenwood Houses and working with the New York City Housing Authority to confront the backlog of maintenance requests from tenants. As a member of both the Council’s Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Siting and Maritime Uses and the Council’s Committee on Land Use, Jumaane has backed efforts to preserve the rich culture and history of neighborhoods across the city, including in his district. In April 2013, he launched a campaign to have the Landmarks Preservation Commission provide protection to the Jackie Robinson House on Tilden Avenue, an effort he hopes may one day lead to the creation of a local museum celebrating the baseball icon’s role in Brooklyn and the civil rights movement. He has also stood with the South Midwood Residents Association and homeowners throughout Victorian Flatbush as they work to 'complete the quilt' of having all of the unique architecture in their micro-neighborhoods receive city landmark status. Jumaane is a staunch believer in responsible development that keeps our communities safe, as he demonstrated when he successfully organized local residents from the East 59th Street Block Association in May 2012 to fight back against a proposed hotel on Foster Avenue that many felt could result in seedy behavior and increased crime. To address this issue going forward, he hopes to pass Intro 861, his legislation to require hotel developers to present their plans to affected community boards."

"Council Member Williams is a proud child of Caribbean parentage, with his family hailing from the island of Grenada. With a district that has one of the largest immigrant populations in New York City, he has made sure to make his office a valued resource for this community. In January 2010, following the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti, Jumaane quickly helped mobilize volunteers and contributions to deliver to reputable relief organizations. As the elected representative of one of the nation’s largest Haitian populations, he was designated as an appointee to a task force created by former Governor Paterson to address the effects of the crisis in New York City and beyond; this led to his creation of the 45th District Haitian Relief Effort, a mobile clinic to provide various types of support for Haitian immigrants and their families, in conjunction with the Haitian American Business Network (HABNET). He was a leading voice in calling for the extension of temporary protected status for Haitian nationals, and he has repeatedly lobbied federal leaders to ensure its extension while the nation recovers. As a member of the Council’s Committee on Immigration, Jumaane has played a key role in the citywide debate on the local implementation of the Secure Communities program, which he feels has had a chilling effect on the immigrant community. He helped pass legislation limiting the use of detainers by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York City, and has pushed for the passage of the DREAM Act as well as comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship. Jumaane also worked directly with City Hall and advocates to bring light to the needs of international teachers recruited to work in the United States with the promise of permanent residency. Jumaane annually funds an immigration attorney from CUNY Citizenship Now!, free of charge to the community, to assist with citizenship applications and related matters. He has also directed thousands of dollars in his expense budget to cultural institutions that directly serve his Caribbean-American constituency and celebrate their rich heritage, including his annual Haitian Flag Day celebration." In January 2010, following the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti, Jumaane quickly helped mobilize volunteers and contributions to deliver to reputable relief organizations.

"Council Member Williams has gained national attention for his commitment to bringing better policing and safer streets to every resident of New York City, especially his constituents in the 45th District. Concerned about the bloodshed in communities of more color, he worked to found the Council’s Task Force to Combat Gun Violence in September 2011. As co-chair, he consulted with a citywide team of experts to produce a comprehensive report of local, state and federal recommendations to address the supply and demand of gun violence, including the establishment of Youth SHIELD (Safe Havens, Improved Environments, Local Development) in February 2012 to improve crime-affected areas. Through these efforts, Jumaane also helped create the Anti-Gun Violence Initiative in June 2012, which to date has funded almost $10 million in pilot programs across the five boroughs to employ the holistic Cure Violence approach in reducing violence. Locally, he joined with East Flatbush Village, Inc. both in May 2010 to start the 'Not in My Hood' anti-violence march and in July 2012 to begin his 'Occupy Our Corners' campaign, all with the goal of having volunteers and violence interrupters positively engage young people. Jumaane has led the fight to end the disparate policing of historically disenfranchised communities, be it the misuse and abuse of stop, question and frisk or the surveillance of Muslim-Americans. In June 2012, he organized a delegation of city and state elected officials to travel to our nation’s capital to meet with the Department of Justice and Congress over profiling concerns. In conjunction with a citywide advocacy campaign, Jumaane introduced the Community Safety Act in February 2012, a landmark legislative package aimed at advancing NYPD accountability and oversight while significantly improving relationships between police and the communities they serve. Following over a year of negotiations, the City Council passed Intro 1079, which will establish a NYPD inspector general within the Department of Investigation, and Intro 1080, which will create the first enforceable ban on bias-based profiling in New York City, by veto-proof majorities in June 2012. Following the blizzard of December 2010, Jumaane used his role as chair of the Council’s Committee on Oversight and Investigations to hold citywide hearings on the City’s storm response. As a result of his findings, he introduced and passed Local Law 29 in May 2011, which has improved 311 service during emergencies. Jumaane has been vigilant in calling for addressing the problems with the 911 call system and increasing diversity within the ranks of the FDNY; he also has fought against the closure of firehouses during yearly budget negotiations. Jumaane values the close relationship he has developed with local law enforcement, working with them on a daily basis to make the 45th District a safer place. He has funded local gun buyback and Safe Surrender programs, in conjunction with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, to get dangerous weapons off our streets and assist individuals with re-entering society. Working with Community Board 17, he helped start a local Community Observation Patrol; in the future, he hopes to collaborate with them to establish a Community Emergency Response Team that can assist in crisis situations. Jumaane believes our city should hire more police officers and civilianize the NYPD’s clerical and administrative positions, in an effort to reduce overtime costs, increase the number of men and women patrolling our neighborhoods and bring a return to community policing in New York City."

"The overarching goal that Council Member Williams has for his efforts in the 45th District is for all young people to have a safe place to learn and grow. To achieve that, he has taken an assertive approach to addressing constituent issues and improving the climate for families, seniors and small businesses alike to flourish. Jumaane has performed community outreach across the district on a wide variety of issues, including holding yearly health and resource fairs, community screenings for breast cancer and brain tumors and free workshops and clinics on legal issues. With the help of his Community Volunteer Corps and his youth group, Students Taking Action Today (S.T.A.T.), he has organized community clean-up days to engage young people in beautifying their neighborhood, donation drives to provide books, school supplies and food to the less fortunate as well as holiday concerts and parties for local senior citizens. Going forward, Jumaane also looks forward to continue advancing entertainment in the community, hosting film screenings and promoting local artists and musicians. One of Jumaane’s primary missions has been to establish a full-service community center in the 45th District. He is proud to have secured funding from City Hall for a feasibility study that represents the first step towards its construction. Jumaane has also allocated millions of dollars in his capital budget towards improvements at local parks such as Glenwood Playground and Paerdegat Park, and he looks to continue exploring ways to maximize the use of current and future open space in the community, such as the creation of community gardens and community murals. Improving the local environment has always been a focus for Jumaane, including his advocacy for home weatherization and solarizing local buildings. One of his legislative priorities is the passage of Intro 966, his effort to address flooding concerns by requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to regularly report inspection, cleanup and maintenance of catch basins. He also seeks to address the health problems that local air quality has created and to improve access to healthy food options, in part through the creation of a farmer’s market pilot program in the Flatbush Junction. Jumaane has been a friend to small businesses, advocating for the reduction of fines by the Department of Consumer Affairs and co-chairing a Council hearing on the restaurant grading system, which called into question the over-penalization of well-intentioned entrepreneurs by the Department of Health. At the same time, he has been staunchly opposed to enterprises attempting to prey on New Yorkers, as he identified with the emergence of internet sweepstakes cafés engaged in illegal activity. In May 2013, he led the passage of Local Law 45, which will require the mandatory revocation of an amusement arcade or gaming cafe license for engaging in unlawful gambling. Jumaane has organized business corridor forums to assist local small businesses, has begun efforts to help establish a business improvement district on Utica Avenue as well as a merchants’ association on Nostrand Avenue and is exploring ways to help brand the 'Little Caribbean', all in an effort to help spur economic activity. Transportation safety is a growing concern in the community which Jumaane is helping to address. After labeling part of his district the 'East Flatbush Motorist Danger Zone', the Department of Transportation partnered with him to address a problem intersection at Kings Highway and Foster Avenue in May 2013. He will continue to monitor issues of speeding and traffic congestion that pose challenges to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike, proposing solutions like neighborhood slow zones in Midwood and speed cameras near schools. Jumaane looks forward to the improvements that the new Streetscape project will bring to the Flatbush Junction and will consider how bus rapid transit and other public transportation improvements could enhance the quality of life of his constituency."

Fifty-nine of the races were in state house chambers, and five were in a state senate chamber. Click here to see a list of all the races. Of the 85 state legislative chambers that held elections in 2024, 21 (24.7%) had at least one race that was decided by fewer than 100 votes. The New Hampshire House of Representatives had 22 races decided by fewer than 100 votes—more than any other chamber. As of 2020 , there were, on average, 3,444 people in each New Hampshire House district, making them the smallest state legislative districts in the country. The Maine House of Representatives and Vermont House of Representatives each had nine races decided by fewer than 100 votes—the second-highest number after the New Hampshire House. The Maine House was also the only chamber where the number of races decided by fewer than 100 votes exceeded the total number of seats separating Democrats and Republicans following the election. In 2022 , there were two such chambers—the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Houses. In Maine, nine races were decided by fewer than 100 votes, and Democrats had a 76-73-2 majority after the election. This means that the Maine House was as close as 21 total votes away from a Republican majority. Had the two closest races won by Democrats— District 75 (decided by seven votes) and District 52 (decided by 14 votes)—been won by Republicans instead, the result would have been a 75-74-2 Republican majority. Across all 64 races, Democrats won 36 (56.3%), Republicans won 27 (42.2%), and one winner (1.6%) was unenrolled. In 2022, Democrats won 49 races by fewer than 100 votes (47.6%), Republicans won 52 (50.5%), Independents won one (1%), and one was tied. Most of the races took place in districts with small population sizes compared to the rest of the country. Forty-eight (75%) were in districts with a population of less than 25,000. Districts that size made up 26.3% of all state legislative districts as of 2020. In 2022 , there were 103 (1.64%) of the 6,278 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes. In 2020 , there were 30 (0.5%) of the 5,875 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.  To contribute to the list of Maine scorecards, email suggestions to editor@ballotpedia.org .  2024 2024 In 2024, the Maine State Legislature was in session from January 3 to April 17.

Ten districts were represented by multiple members, while three were represented by one member each. [4] The Vermont General Assembly meets at the State House in Montpelier. Vermont has a divided government where neither party holds a trifecta . The Republican Party controls the office of governor, while the Democratic Party controls  both chambers of the state legislature. Senate Senate The Vermont Senate is the upper house of the Vermont General Assembly. The Senate consists of 30 members. Senate districting divides the 30 members into three single-member districts, six two-member districts, three three-member districts and one six-member district. As of the 2020 Census, Vermont state senators represented an average of 21,450 residents .     After the 2010 Census, each member represented 21,011 residents . There is no limit to the number of terms that a senator may serve. Like other upper houses of state legislatures and the federal U.S. Senate , the Vermont Senate performs special functions such as confirming or rejecting gubernatorial appointments to executive departments, the state cabinet, commissions, boards, and electing members to the Vermont Supreme Court. Senators are elected from a total of 13 Senate districts. The districts more or less correspond to the boundaries of the state's 14 counties (with adjustments to ensure equality of representation). Two small counties, Essex and Orleans, are combined into one district. Each district elects between one and six senators depending on its population. Additionally, Vermont is one of 14 states in which members of the upper legislative house serve two-year terms rather than four-year terms.

Representatives and senators serve two-year terms. One must be a resident of the state for the two years (and of the legislative district for the one year) immediately preceding the election in order to qualify for either chamber. Leadership Leadership The House is headed by the speaker of the House, while the Senate is headed by the state's lieutenant governor as the Senate president. The Senate president only casts a vote in the case of a tie. More often, the Senate is presided over by the president pro tempore, or temporary president. Functions Functions The legislature is empowered to make law, subject to the governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each chamber. The legislature has the sole power to propose amendments to the Vermont Constitution . An amendment must originate in the Senate, where it must receive a two-thirds vote. After passing the Senate, it must also receive a majority vote in the House. Any amendment that passes both houses must be re-passed by majority votes after a newly elected legislature is seated—again, first in the Senate, then in the House. The proposed amendment must then be passed by a majority of the state's voters as a referendum . Only every other Senate session may initiate the amendment process. Thus, Senates elected in off-year (i.e., non-presidential) elections may initiate amendments, but not Senates elected during presidential elections. (See the Vermont Constitution, Chapter 2, Section 72 .) The role of minor parties The role of minor parties The General Assembly is notable for being the only state legislature in the United States with a significant minor-party presence. As of February 2021, seven members of the House and two members of the Senate belonged to the Vermont Progressive Party . Several other parties have won legislative seats, including the Green Party and the Liberty Union Party (based largely on the philosophy of Eugene V. Debs). Some members of the minor parties caucus with members of the Vermont Democratic Party. Role in state budget Role in state budget Vermont on Vermont on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions The state operates on an annual budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [17] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies in August or September of the year preceding the start of the new fiscal year. Agencies submit their budget requests to the governor in October . Agency hearings are held in October and November . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the state legislature in January . The legislature typically passes a budget in May . A simple majority is required to pass a budget. The fiscal year begins July 1 . In Vermont, the governor cannot exercise veto authority over the budget. [17] The governor is not legally required to submit—and the legislature is not legally required to pass—a balanced budget. [17] District maps District maps State Senate State Senate  State House State House Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Vermont are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers. Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 100 of the 150 members in the Vermont House of Representatives and 20 of the 30 members in the Vermont State Senate . Vermont is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. How can vetoes be overridden after the legislature has adjourned? In 1995, the Legislature began setting a date to consider veto overrides in its annual adjournment resolution. This allows the legislature to hold sessions where it can override vetoes that occurred following adjournment. [18] Authority: Legislative Department, Section 11 of the Vermont Constitution . "Every bill which shall have passed the Senate and House of Representatives shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor; if the Governor approve, the Governor shall sign it; if not, the Governor shall return it, with objections in writing, to the House in which it shall have originated; which shall proceed to reconsider it. If, upon such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members present of that House shall pass the bill, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of the members present of that House, it shall become a law." Redistricting Redistricting Because Vermont has only one congressional district, congressional redistricting is not necessary. The state legislature draws state legislative district lines with the assistance of an advisory commission. This advisory commission consists of the following members: [19] The governor appoints one member each from the state's political parties. To qualify for consideration in this context, a political party must have had "at least three state legislators for six of the previous 10 years." The chairs of the aforementioned political parties each appoint an additional member. The chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court appoints the commission's chair. Commissioners cannot be legislators, nor can they be employed by the legislature. The commission may make recommendations to the legislature, but these recommendations are non-binding. [19] State law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and compact and that they "adhere to county and other political subdivision boundaries, except where necessary to comply with other legal requirements." In addition, state statutes specify that districts should account for "patterns of geography, social interaction, trade, political ties, and common interests." [19] 2020 2020 Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) signed H722 on April 6, 2022, enacting new legislative districts for the state House and Senate. [20] The Vermont House of Representatives voted 129-13 to advance the state legislative redistricting bill on March 16. [21] On March 25, the Vermont State Senate unanimously approved H722, sending it to Scott. [22] These maps took effect for Vermont's 2022 legislative elections.  2010 2010 Vermont received its 2010 census data on February 10, 2011. The state grew by 2.8 percent. The most populous cities showed mixed growth results: Burlington grew by 9.1 percent, Essex grew by 5.2 percent, South Burlington grew by 13.2 percent, Colchester grew by 0.5 percent, and Rutland decreased by 4.6 percent. [23] The 2011 redistricting process was notable for a push to eliminate nearly all of the state's multi-member districts .  Though a preliminary plan that achieved this end was passed by the board, its final plan from August 11, 2011, only reduced the number of two-member districts from 42 to 29. The legislature took up redistricting in January 2012.  Despite disagreements over deviation from ideal district size (18.2 percent for the Senate and 24 percent for the House), the Senate passed and the House concurred with a final plan, H. 789.  The plan added a new seat in Burlington and paired incumbents Dennis Devereux (R) and Eldred French (D).  Governor Peter Shumlin (D) signed the maps into law on May 1, 2012. [24] Legislators Legislators Salaries Salaries $843.32/week during session No per diem paid during session. Members can receive $168.66/day in per diem outside of session. Pension Pension Vermont does not provide pensions for legislators. [26] When sworn in When sworn in Vermont legislators assume office the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January.

The Vermont State Senate was one of 16 state senates that were Democratic for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992 and 2013. Vermont was under Democratic trifectas for the final three years of the study. Across the country, there were 541 Democratic and 517 Republican state senates from 1992 to 2013. Vermont House: From 1992 to 2013, Democrats held a majority in the House of Representatives for 17 years while Republicans held a majority for five years. Vermont was under Democratic trifectas for the final three years of the study. Across the country, there were 577 Democratic and 483 Republican State Houses of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. Over the course of the 22-year study, state governments became increasingly more partisan. At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states—the most in the 22 years studied. The chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of Vermont , the Vermont State Senate and the Vermont House of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. SQLI and partisanship SQLI and partisanship The chart below depicts the partisanship of the Vermont state government and the state's State Quality of Life Index (SQLI) ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1 to 50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. During the course of the study, Vermont had Democratic trifectas from 1997 to 2000 and from 2011 to 2013. Its lowest ranking, finishing 33rd, occurred in 2008 during a divided government. Its highest ranking, finishing 15th, also occurred during a divided government from 2003 to 2004. Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Vermont Constitution can be amended: Section 72 of the Vermont Constitution lays out the procedure governing changes to the Vermont Constitution . Vermont does not feature the power of initiative for either initiated state statutes or initiated constitutional amendments . Legislature Legislature A two-thirds (66.67%) vote is required in the Vermont State Senate and a simple majority vote is required in the Vermont House of Representatives in the first legislative session. A simple majority vote is required in both chambers in the second legislative session to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 20 votes in the Vermont State Senate and 76 votes in the Vermont House of Representatives in the first session and 16 votes in the state senate and 76 votes in the state house in the second session, assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention The Vermont Constitution, like that of several other states , does not provide for constitutional conventions .  Perhaps as a result, Vermont's current constitution is one of the oldest in the country, having been adopted in 1793.  The Massachusetts Constitution is the only older constitution. Although there are no provisions in the state's constitution governing the calling of a constitutional convention, in 1969, the Vermont State Legislature referred an advisory measure to the ballot which asked "Shall a Vermont Constitutional Convention be convened at the state house in Montpelier on October 6, 1969 to consider the following topics which shall receive a majority of the votes cast upon it in this election, and no others?" The question was rejected by the voters.

The election cannot be held after February 1 before a spring general election, unless it is held on the same day of the election, which is the first Tuesday in April. The same requirement applies to any election preceding the fall general election (after August 1),  with the exception of elections held on the first Tuesday in November. [14] Also, all vacancies must be filled quickly as long the vacancy happened before the second Tuesday in May during an election year. [15] See sources: Wisconsin Cons. Art.

Use the interactive map below to find your district.   Redistricting Redistricting In Wisconsin, both congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the Wisconsin State Legislature . These lines are subject to veto by the governor . [16] The Wisconsin Constitution requires that state legislative districts be compact and "that they be bounded by county, precinct, town, or ward lines where possible." The state constitution further stipulates that state legislative districts should be contiguous. [16] 2020-2024 2020-2024 On February 19, 2024, Gov. Tony Evers (D) signed Senate Bill 488 into law, adopting new Wisconsin legislative maps. [17] Gov. Evers originally proposed the newly adopted legislative maps in 2021. The maps were approved by majority votes in both chambers of Wisconsin's state legislature on February 13. The state Senate voted 18-14 in favor of adopting the new legislative maps, while the state Assembly vote total was 63-33. In the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court election , Janet Protasiewicz defeated Daniel Kelly , changing the balance of the court from a conservative to a liberal majority for the first time in 15 years. [18] [19] On December 22, 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in a 4-3 vote that the state's legislative maps were unconstitutional and ordered new maps to be drawn before the 2024 election.

Wisconsin State House Districts after 2020 redistricting cycle Click a district to compare boundaries.  2010-2012 2010-2012 According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Wisconsin's population increased from 5.36 million to 5.69 million between 2000 and 2010. [21] This population growth was large enough to allow the state to retain its eight Congressional seats. [22] Republicans held the governorship and majorities in the state Senate and state Assembly after the 2010 elections.  As a result, the redistricting process was controlled by one party. The redistricting process was accelerated by the summer 2011 recall elections , and when Gov. Scott Walker (R) signed a bill giving the legislature the power to redistrict state boundaries before the localities finished their redistricting processes. [23] State Republicans presented their plan on July 8, 2011, and the maps passed the legislature on July 19, 2011. [24] [25] Gov. Walker signed the plan into law on August 9, 2011. [25] Several lawsuits were filed as a result of the new maps. [26] The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board identified errors in the maps, and a court also determined that two Milwaukee-area districts needed to be redrawn to better represent minority-area populations.

The legislature began a special session on August 1, 2017, over a tax incentive package for Foxconn. Click [show] to read about the 2017 session. Lawmakers in Wisconsin failed to pass a state budget by the start of the state’s new fiscal year on July 1. [29] The missed deadline, however, was not out of the ordinary in Wisconsin. Between 1997 and 2017, the state passed only three budgets by July 1. [30] In Wisconsin, spending levels from the previous two-year budget stay in effect until a new budget passes, allowing state agencies to continue operating and sparing citizens from most effects of a government shutdown. If the budget were to continue to be ironed out months down the road, some projects could be delayed and local school districts would be in the position of setting budgets without knowing how much state funding will be available. [29] The Joint Finance Committee of the Wisconsin State Legislature passed a motion on September 5 that led to budget negotiations moving forward in the legislature.  The plan, which was passed by the committee on a 12-4 party-line vote, put $400 million towards transportation.  Governor Scott Walker ’s (R) budget proposal had $500 million going into transportation.  The committee's plan also included a state registration fee of $100 for electric vehicles and $75 for hybrid vehicles.  On September 6, the full $76 billion budget passed in the finance committee.  The state Assembly approved the budget in a 57-39 vote on September 12, and the state Senate approved it on September 15.  Until the afternoon of September 15 it was unclear if Republicans would have the 17 votes required to pass the bill.  However, after a three-hour recess, senators returned to the floor with Republicans suggesting that they have the votes needed for the votes to pass. [31] The bill passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote. [32] Governor Walker made 99 vetoes to the bill before signing it on September 21, exercising Wisconsin's line-item veto power that extends to individual words, exceeding the power of most state governors. [33] Throughout Wisconsin's 2017 legislative session, Republicans in the state Senate and state Assembly disagreed on how to fund road projects, how to increase funding for K-12 schools, and how to cut taxes. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) said on Wisconsin Public Radio, "If you're not willing to raise the revenues, it's not conservative to borrow and spend, which is unfortunately what it seems like our Senate colleagues are talking about." [34] On September 14, members of the state Assembly voted in 64-31 favor of a $3 billion tax incentive package aimed at bringing a Taiwanese LCD flat screen factory to southeast Wisconsin. [35] That vote sent the bill to the desk of Gov. Walker, who signed the bill not long after. [36] Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., which trades as Foxconn Technology Group, looked to build a $10 billion campus in Southeast Wisconsin.  Foxconn announced in October 2017 that the factory would be built in Mount Pleasant in Racine County . [37] The new factory was projected to bring up to 13,000 jobs to the area by 2021. Salaries would start at $41,600 a year and would average $53,900. The deal would allow Foxconn to receive up to $1.35 billion after a full investment has been made into the plant and equipment. Another $1.5 billion would be given to Foxconn after the company begins to employ workers. [38] A report by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that it could take 25 years for the state to break even financially on the deal. [39] [40] Foxconn is also looking at Dane County for a second campus. 2016 See also: Dates of 2016 state legislative sessions In 2016, the legislature was in session from January 12 through March 15. 2015 See also: Dates of 2015 state legislative sessions In 2015, the legislature was in session from January 5 through December 31. Major issues in 2015 Like many states, the issue that topped the Wisconsin State Legislature's to-do list was the state's budget.  Wisconsin faced a $2.2 million budget shortfall, and lawmakers were forced to address the issue before any other projects.  The Republican agenda also focused on reducing the size of government, tax cuts, entitlement reform, and school accountability.  The Democrats, on the other hand, emphasized their interest in raising the minimum wage and income inequality. 2014 See also: Dates of 2014 state legislative sessions In 2014, the legislature was in session from January 14 through June 4. Major issues in 2014 Major issues during the 2014 legislative session included income tax, public school funding, health care, and jobs. [41] 2013 See also: Dates of 2013 state legislative sessions In 2013, the legislature was in session from January 7 to December 31. Major issues in 2013 Following the extreme polarization of the previous two years, Gov. Scott Walker (R) said he would push for a more moderate agenda in 2013. Alongside the creation of a new budget, main issues included job creation, workforce development, tax cuts, education reform, and transportation infrastructure. [42] 2012 See also: Dates of 2012 state legislative sessions In 2012, the legislature was in session from January 10 through March 16 with a return for limited business on April 24. Major issues in 2012 With potential recalls of Governor Scott Walker (R), Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch (R) and four Republican state senators , debate on major legislation was expected to be limited.  Going into the session, Republican leaders said they were focused on passing bills on only four main issues - clearing the way for an ore mine in northern Wisconsin, easing laws regarding development on wetlands, environmental regulation, and creating a venture capital fund to help start-up businesses. [43] The six recalls dominated the session. Ultimately on June 5, 2012, recalls against the Governor, Lt. Governor, and three of the state senators were unsuccessful. The fourth recall, that against Van Wanggaard , went to a recount. Wanggaard was defeated, giving Democrats control of the Senate. 2011 See also: Dates of 2011 state legislative sessions In 2011, the legislature adjourned a special session at the request of Governor Scott Walker (R) on January 4, 2011. The special session was called to consider legislation regarding tax credits, tort law, medical savings accounts, other legislation relating to taxation, and the budget repair bill. The legislature's special session was ongoing.  The regular session began on January 11. An extraordinary session was called by the legislature from June 13-30, with another extraordinary session held from July 19-29.

[34] On September 14, members of the state Assembly voted in 64-31 favor of a $3 billion tax incentive package aimed at bringing a Taiwanese LCD flat screen factory to southeast Wisconsin. [35] That vote sent the bill to the desk of Gov. Walker, who signed the bill not long after. [36] Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., which trades as Foxconn Technology Group, looked to build a $10 billion campus in Southeast Wisconsin.  Foxconn announced in October 2017 that the factory would be built in Mount Pleasant in Racine County . [37] The new factory was projected to bring up to 13,000 jobs to the area by 2021. Salaries would start at $41,600 a year and would average $53,900. The deal would allow Foxconn to receive up to $1.35 billion after a full investment has been made into the plant and equipment. Another $1.5 billion would be given to Foxconn after the company begins to employ workers. [38] A report by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that it could take 25 years for the state to break even financially on the deal. [39] [40] Foxconn is also looking at Dane County for a second campus. 2016 2016 In 2016, the legislature was in session from January 12 through March 15. 2015 2015 In 2015, the legislature was in session from January 5 through December 31. Major issues in 2015 Major issues in 2015 Like many states, the issue that topped the Wisconsin State Legislature's to-do list was the state's budget.  Wisconsin faced a $2.2 million budget shortfall, and lawmakers were forced to address the issue before any other projects.  The Republican agenda also focused on reducing the size of government, tax cuts, entitlement reform, and school accountability.  The Democrats, on the other hand, emphasized their interest in raising the minimum wage and income inequality. 2014 2014 In 2014, the legislature was in session from January 14 through June 4. Major issues in 2014 Major issues in 2014 Major issues during the 2014 legislative session included income tax, public school funding, health care, and jobs. [41] 2013 2013 In 2013, the legislature was in session from January 7 to December 31. Major issues in 2013 Major issues in 2013 Following the extreme polarization of the previous two years, Gov. Scott Walker (R) said he would push for a more moderate agenda in 2013. Alongside the creation of a new budget, main issues included job creation, workforce development, tax cuts, education reform, and transportation infrastructure. [42] 2012 2012 In 2012, the legislature was in session from January 10 through March 16 with a return for limited business on April 24. Major issues in 2012 Major issues in 2012 With potential recalls of Governor Scott Walker (R), Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch (R) and four Republican state senators , debate on major legislation was expected to be limited.  Going into the session, Republican leaders said they were focused on passing bills on only four main issues - clearing the way for an ore mine in northern Wisconsin, easing laws regarding development on wetlands, environmental regulation, and creating a venture capital fund to help start-up businesses. [43] The six recalls dominated the session. Ultimately on June 5, 2012, recalls against the Governor, Lt. Governor, and three of the state senators were unsuccessful. The fourth recall, that against Van Wanggaard , went to a recount. Wanggaard was defeated, giving Democrats control of the Senate. 2011 2011 In 2011, the legislature adjourned a special session at the request of Governor Scott Walker (R) on January 4, 2011. The special session was called to consider legislation regarding tax credits, tort law, medical savings accounts, other legislation relating to taxation, and the budget repair bill. The legislature's special session was ongoing.  The regular session began on January 11. An extraordinary session was called by the legislature from June 13-30, with another extraordinary session held from July 19-29. [44] 2010 2010 In 2010, the legislature convened its legislative session on January 19, and it ended its last scheduled floor-period on April 22. [45]  About legislative sessions in Wisconsin About legislative sessions in Wisconsin The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution declares that any power not already given to the federal government is reserved to the states and the people. [46] State governments across the country use this authority to hold legislative sessions where a state's elected representatives meet for a period of time to draft and vote on legislation and set state policies on issues such as taxation, education, and government spending. The different types of legislation passed by a legislature may include resolutions, legislatively referred constitutional amendments , and bills that become law. Article IV of the Wisconsin Constitution contains provisions related to the meeting of the Wisconsin State Legislature , of which the Assembly is a part.  Section 11 of Article IV states that the times for regular sessions are to be provided by law.  Section 11 also states that the Governor of Wisconsin has the power to call the Legislature into special session. Legislative roles and procedures Legislative roles and procedures Every state legislature throughout the country features its own internal procedures that it uses to govern itself and how it interacts with other parts of state government. Ballotpedia's coverage of internal state legislative procedures includes veto overrides , the role of the legislature in the state budget , and procedures for filling membership vacancies . Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Wisconsin are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers. Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 66 of the 99 members in the Wisconsin State Assembly and 22 of the 33 members in the Wisconsin State Senate . Wisconsin is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Authority: Article V, Section 10 of the Wisconsin Constitution . "(2) (a) If the governor rejects the bill, the governor shall return the bill, together with the objections in writing, to the house in which the bill originated. The house of origin shall enter the objections at large upon the journal and proceed to reconsider the bill. If, after such reconsideration, two−thirds of the members present agree to pass the bill notwithstanding the objections of the governor, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two−thirds of the members present it shall become law." Role in state budget Role in state budget Wisconsin on Wisconsin on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions Wisconsin operates on a biennial budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [47] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies in June . State agencies submit budget requests in September . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the Wisconsin State Legislature in January or February . The legislature adopts a budget in June or July . A simple majority is needed to pass a budget. The biennial budget cycle begins July 1 . Wisconsin is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [47] [48] The governor is constitutionally and statutorily required to submit a balanced budget. In addition, the legislature is required to pass a balanced budget. [47] Committees Committees Every state legislature and state legislative chamber in the country contains several legislative committees. These committees are responsible for studying, amending, and voting on legislation before it reaches the floor of a chamber for a full vote. The different types of committees include standing committees, select or special, and joint. Standing committees are generally permanent committees, the names of which sometimes change from session to session. Select or special committees are temporary committees formed to deal with specific issues such as recent legislation, major public policy or proposals, or investigations. Joint committees are committees that feature members of both chambers of a legislature. Ballotpedia covers standing and joint committees. The Wisconsin State Assembly has  45  standing  committees: Aging and Long-Term Care Committee Agriculture Committee Assembly Organization Committee Audit Committee Campaigns and Elections Committee Children and Families Committee Colleges and Universities Committee Constitution and Ethics Committee Consumer Protection Committee Corrections Committee Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee Education Committee Employment Relations Committee Energy and Utilities Committee Environment Committee Family Law Committee Finance Committee Financial Institutions Committee Forestry, Parks, and Outdoor Recreation Committee Government Accountability and Oversight Committee Health Committee Housing and Real Estate Committee Insurance Committee Jobs and the Economy Committee Judiciary Committee Labor Committee Labor and Integrated Employment Committee Local Government Committee Mental Health Committee Public Benefit Reform Committee Regulatory Licensing Reform Committee Review of Administrative Rules Committee Rules Committee Rural Development Committee Science and Technology Committee Science, Technology and Broadband Committee Small Business Development Committee Sporting Heritage Committee State Affairs Committee Substance Abuse and Prevention Committee Tourism Committee Transportation Committee Veterans and Military Affairs Committee Ways and Means Committee Workforce Development Committee  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Wisconsin Constitution can be amended: Article XII of the Wisconsin Constitution provides two methods of amendment: A legislatively referred constitutional amendment may be proposed to the voters if approved by a simple majority of both chambers of the Wisconsin State Legislature in two legislative sessions. If an amendment is approved by a majority in both chambers of the Legislature in one session, that proposed amendment must then be considered by the state legislature chosen at the next general election in the state. Before that second legislative session, the proposed amendment that will be considered must be published for three months prior to the election. Should the amendment be approved by a simple majority of the second session that considers it, the proposed amendment is then placed on a statewide ballot at a special or general election. If it is approved by a simple majority of the state's electorate, it becomes part of the constitution. Constitutional conventions can also be used to propose amendments to the state's constitution. If a simple majority of both houses of the Wisconsin State Legislature votes in favor, a constitutional convention question is placed on a statewide ballot. If the electors of the state agree by a simple majority to call a constitutional convention, then the legislature needs to convene a convention during its next session. Wisconsin citizens do not have the power of amending the constitution through initiated constitutional amendments .

The Washington Post called Scott Rasmussen “a driving force in American politics.” The Wall Street Journal described him as “America’s Insurgent Pollster” and a “key player in the contact sport of politics.” Long recognized as one of the world’s leading public opinion pollsters, Scott is the publisher of ScottRasmussen.com and Editor-at-Large for Ballotpedia. He is committed to enhancing the public dialogue through data-driven analysis that explores the underlying currents of public opinion. “ Scott Rasmussen’s Number of the Day ,” published each weekday by Ballotpedia, features newsworthy and interesting topics at the intersection of politics, culture, and technology. Through the ScottRasmussen.com Daily Tracking Poll, Scott focuses on foundational public attitudes rather than the partisan political obsessions of official Washington. Innovation has been a hallmark of Scott’s career. In 1978, the then-new technology of satellite communications dramatically reduced the cost of sending a broadcast signal around the nation. Building upon that opportunity, Scott and his father, Bill, founded ESPN, the cable sports network. In the 1990s, the birth of the Internet provided the unique opportunity to capitalize on another ground-breaking technology. Scott launched his first website in 1994 and became the first pollster to offer data directly to the public rather than filtered through a network reporter. It was also at this time that Scott saw the potential for the concept of automated polling and ultimately revolutionized the polling industry. In just over a decade, Scott’s work attracted more Google searches than the long-established industry leader—Gallup. Today, the era of phone polling is coming to an end , and Scott is again looking to the future. He is working with HarrisX and using next generation practices to develop reliable polling for the digital era. In 2003, Scott founded Rasmussen Reports and served as President of the company for the following decade. Over time, however, he and the majority investors had different visions for the company’s future. In January 2013, Scott informed the board that he would not renew his contract. He left in July of that year and has not been involved with the firm since that time. His most recent book, The Sun is Still Rising: Politics Has Failed But America Will Not , was published in 2018 by the Sutherland Institute. The book explains Scott’s optimism about our nation’s future despite his deep pessimism over our broken political system. Co-founder of No Labels, Mark McKinnon, says the book features “some of the freshest, most inspiring thinking I’ve read in years…There’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and Rasmussen has found it.” Fox News Analyst Juan Williams described the book as “a gripping, history-based account… on how change really happens before the politicians run to the front of the parade.” It is “an optimistic, open-hearted book” according to Brookings Institution scholar Jonathan Rauch. “Rasmussen delivers a spirited and timely reminder that civic groups, innovative businesses, and personal networks are where the real action will be in the 21st century—and that their potential to improve our lives and our country is vast.” A New York Times bestselling author, Scott clearly articulates the reality that governing society is not the responsibility of government alone. Every organization and relationship has a role to play. He shares this message along with insightful political analysis as a sought-after public speaker and syndicated columnist. Rasmussen grew up in the broadcasting industry and served as an announcer for the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association. Rasmussen's childhood idol, hockey legend Gordie Howe, played for the team during that time. Rasmussen served as emcee for Howe's 50th birthday celebration in 1978, which Rasmussen cites as a highlight of his life: "Nothing in my professional career will ever equal the thrill of standing at center ice in the spotlight with Gordie to celebrate his birthday." Scott graduated with a degree in history from DePauw University and earned his MBA at Wake Forest University. He is married and has two grown sons and a daughter-in-law.

Voters enacted the Oklahoma Term Limits Act in 1990.  That initiative limits Oklahoma state legislators to no more than twelve years in the Oklahoma State Legislature .  These 12 years can be served in any combination of the Oklahoma State Senate and the Oklahoma House of Representatives . [15] The first year that the term limits enacted in 1990 impacted the ability of incumbents to run for office was in 2004. Vacancies Vacancies If there is a vacancy in the Oklahoma State Legislature , the governor must call a special election no later than 30 days after the vacancy occurs.  No special election can be called if the vacancy occurs in an even-numbered year and if the term of office will expire in that year. This second provision allows special elections to be held for outgoing senators with two or more years left in their terms. [16] If a senator announces his or her resignation before March 1 but the effective date lies between the general election and the new session, a special election can be held on the general election dates. The winner of this election will take office upon the senator's official resignation. This only applies to senators with two or more years remaining in their terms. [16] See sources: Oklahoma Stat. Ann. tit. 26, § 12-106 See sources: Oklahoma Stat. Ann. tit. 26, § 12-106  District map District map The state of Oklahoma has 101 state House districts. Each district elects one representative. Use the interactive map below to find your district.   Redistricting Redistricting In Oklahoma, both congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the Oklahoma State Legislature . These lines may be vetoed by the governor . [17] If the legislature is unable to approve a state legislative redistricting plan, a backup commission must draw the lines. The commission comprises the following seven members: [17] The governor appoints one Republican and one Democrat. The majority leader of the Oklahoma State Senate appoints one Republican and one Democrat. The majority leader of the Oklahoma House of Representatives appoints one Republican and one Democrat. The lieutenant governor serves as the non-voting chair of the commission. The Oklahoma Constitution requires that state Senate district boundaries take into account "population, compactness, area, political units, historical precedents, economic and political interests, contiguous territory, and other major factors." [17] The redistricting committee of the state House adopted redistricting guidelines similar to the senatorial district requirements described above. These guidelines apply to state House and congressional districts, as well. These guidelines may be amended by the state legislature at its discretion. [17] 2020 2020 Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed new legislative maps into law on November 22, 2021. [18] The Senate approved the Senate map in a 46-1 vote on November 17, 2021, and the House approved the Senate map 95-1 on November 19, 2021. [19] The House approved the House map 88-3 on November 17, 2021, and the Senate approved the House map 44-2 on November 19, 2021. [20] These maps took effect for Oklahoma's 2022 legislative elections. District map after 2020 redistricting District map after 2020 redistricting This map took effect for Oklahoma's 2022 legislative elections. 2010 2010 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Oklahoma's population increased from 3.45 million to 3.75 million between 2000 and 2010. [21] The population was densest around Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Growth rates were highest in the suburban and exurban areas surrounding these cities, while rural Oklahoma counties grew at a lower rate or lost population.  Of Oklahoma's 77 counties, 23 saw a drop in population between 2000 and 2010. [22] The state's overall growth rate was 8.7 percent, which was below the national average of 9.7 percent, but not low enough to cost the state a Congressional seat. [23] Oklahoma officials received detailed Oklahoma results from the Census in February 2011.  The legislature formed steering committees in each chamber to draft the maps before the May 27, 2011 deadline.  The House of Representatives completed its work relatively quickly, producing a map that avoided putting any incumbents in a district together by early May. [24] The Senate did not produce a map until mid-May. [25] [26] [27] The House map was passed in its initial vote, while the Senate encountered minority opposition.  The opposition eased on the second round of votes, and the Gov. Mary Fallin (R) signed the bills into law on May 20, 2011, seven days before the deadline.

[40]  About legislative sessions in Oklahoma About legislative sessions in Oklahoma The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution declares that any power not already given to the federal government is reserved to the states and the people. [41] State governments across the country use this authority to hold legislative sessions where a state's elected representatives meet for a period of time to draft and vote on legislation and set state policies on issues such as taxation, education, and government spending. The different types of legislation passed by a legislature may include resolutions, legislatively referred constitutional amendments , and bills that become law. Article V of the Oklahoma Constitution establishes when the Oklahoma State Legislature , of which the House of Representatives is a part, is to be in session.  Section 26 of Article V states that the Legislature is to meet in regular session on the first Monday in February of each year, and it is to adjourn its regular session by the last Friday in May of each year.  Additionally, Section 26 also states that the Legislature is to meet for organizational purposes on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in January of each odd-numbered year. Section 27 of Article V contains the rules for convening special sessions of the Legislature.  Section 27 allows a special session to be called by the Governor of Oklahoma or by a written call signed by two-thirds of the members of both legislative houses. Legislative roles and procedures Legislative roles and procedures Every state legislature throughout the country features its own internal procedures that it uses to govern itself and how it interacts with other parts of state government. Ballotpedia's coverage of internal state legislative procedures includes veto overrides , the role of the legislature in the state budget , procedures for filling membership vacancies , and procedures for filling membership vacancies . Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Oklahoma are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members in both chambers. Two-thirds of members in both chambers must vote to override a veto, which is 68 of the 101 members in the Oklahoma House of Representatives and 32 of the 48 members in the Oklahoma State Senate . Oklahoma is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Are there other special rules? If the governor vetoes an emergency measure, three-fourths of the members in both chambers are required to override the veto, which is 76 of the 101 state representatives and 36 of the 48 state senators. [42] Authority: Article VI, Section 11 of the Oklahoma Constitution . "Every bill which shall have passed the Senate and House of Representatives, and every resolution requiring the assent of both branches of the Legislature, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor; if he approve, he shall sign it; if not, he shall return it with his objections to the house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large in the Journal and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill or joint resolution, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and, if approved by two-thirds of the members elected to that house, it shall become a law, notwithstanding the objections of the Governor."

The new fiscal year begins July 1 . Oklahoma is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [43] [44] The governor is constitutionally required to submit a balanced budget proposal. Likewise, the legislature is required to pass a balanced budget. [43] Committees Committees Every state legislature and state legislative chamber in the country contains several legislative committees. These committees are responsible for studying, amending, and voting on legislation before it reaches the floor of a chamber for a full vote. The different types of committees include standing committees, select or special, and joint. Standing committees are generally permanent committees, the names of which sometimes change from session to session. Select or special committees are temporary committees formed to deal with specific issues such as recent legislation, major public policy or proposals, or investigations. Joint committees are committees that feature members of both chambers of a legislature. Ballotpedia covers standing and joint committees. The Oklahoma House of Representatives has  31  standing  committees: Administrative Rules Committee Agriculture & Rural Development Committee Alcohol, Tobacco & Controlled Substances Committee Appropriations and Budget Committee Banking, Financial Services, and Pensions Committee Business and Commerce Committee Children, Youth & Family Services Committee Committee on Government Oversight Common Education Committee County & Municipal Government Committee Criminal Justice & Corrections Committee Elections & Ethics Committee Energy & Natural Resources Committee Government Modernization and Efficiency Committee Health Services and Long-Term Care Committee Higher Education and Career Tech Committee House General Government Committee House Public Safety Committee House Rules Committee House Transportation Committee House Veterans and Military Affairs Committee Insurance Committee Judiciary - Civil Committee Judiciary - Criminal Committee Public Health Committee State and Federal Redistricting Committee States' Rights Committee Technology Committee Tourism Committee Utilities Committee Wildlife Committee  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Oklahoma Constitution can be amended: The Oklahoma Constitution provides three mechanisms for amending the state's constitution—a citizen-initiated process, a legislative process, and a state constitutional convention. Oklahoma requires a simple majority vote (50% plus 1) for voters to approve constitutional amendments. Initiative Initiative An initiated constitutional amendment is a citizen-initiated ballot measure that amends a state's constitution . Eighteen (18) states allow citizens to initiate constitutional amendments. In Oklahoma, the number of signatures required for an initiated constitutional amendment is equal to 15% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election. A simple majority vote is required for voter approval. Legislature Legislature A simple majority vote is required during one legislative session for the Oklahoma State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 51 votes in the Oklahoma House of Representatives and 24 votes in the Oklahoma State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention According to Section 2 of Article XXIV of the Oklahoma Constitution , a question about whether to hold a state constitutional convention is to automatically appear on the state's ballot every 20 years.  Oklahoma is one of 14 states that provides for an automatic constitutional convention question.  However, the last time Oklahomans voted on such a question was in 1970 . [45] According to the State Constitutional Convention Clearinghouse, "Since 1970, Oklahoma’s legislature has refused to follow its Constitution with regard to this provision.  In 1994, it placed a referendum on the ballot to eliminate this requirement, but the people of Oklahoma defeated it.  Since 1990, many bills have been introduced to implement this part of the Constitution but none has passed."

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number.

[1] Maine legislators assume office the day before the first Wednesday of December following the general election. [2] [3] Qualifications Qualifications Section 4 of Part 1 of Article 4 of the Maine Constitution states, "Qualifications; residency requirement. No person shall be a member of the House of Representatives, unless the person shall, at the commencement of the period for which the person is elected, have been 5 years a citizen of the United States, have arrived at the age of 21 years, have been a resident in this State one year; and for the 3 months next preceding the time of this person's election shall have been, and, during the period for which elected, shall continue to be a resident in the district which that person represents. No person may be a candidate for election as a member of the House of Representatives unless, at the time of the nomination for placement on a primary, general or special election ballot, that person is a resident in the district which the candidate seeks to represent." [4] Salaries Salaries $16,245.12 for the first regular session. $11,668.32 for the second regular session. $70/day for lodging (or round-trip mileage up to $0.55/mile in lieu of housing, plus tolls). $50/day for meals. Term limits Term limits The Maine legislature is one of 16 state legislatures with term limits . Voters enacted the Maine Term Limits Act in 1993. That initiative said that Maine representatives are subject to term limits of no more than four two-year terms, or a total of eight years. The first year that the term limits enacted in 1993 impacted the ability of incumbents to run for office was in 1996. [1]  Vacancies Vacancies If there is a vacancy in the Maine State Legislature , a special election must be held to fill the vacant seat. [6] [7] The governor must call for an election and inform political committees of the nomination deadline. [8] [6] [7] The person elected to the seat serves for the remainder of the unexpired term.

Janet Mills (D) signed legislation enacting redrawn state legislative district boundaries. The Maine Apportionment Commission approved final maps and submitted them to the legislature on September 27, 2021.  The Maine Senate unanimously approved both maps by a vote of 31-0. The Maine House of Representatives approved new district boundaries for the state Senate by a vote of 129-0 and new state House district boundaries by a vote of 119-10. [10] These maps took effect for Maine’s 2022 legislative elections. The Maine Wire reported, "The legislature made no changes to the maps the Apportionment Commission submitted, but some legislators did express dissatisfaction with the way districts had been drawn." [11] Some lawmakers objected to changes made to the composition of their districts, such as Ben Collings (D). After the plans were approved, Collings said, "“I did my best to work with the [apportionment] committee and use the process to make those changes.” “Unfortunately that did not come together for the district I represent.” [10] How does redistricting in Maine work? In Maine, both congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the state legislature. An advisory commission is also involved in the process. A two-thirds majority is required to approve new district maps, which are subject to veto by the governor . [12] The composition of the 15-member advisory redistricting commission is as follows: [12] The majority and minority leaders of the Maine State Senate each select two commissioners. The majority and minority leaders of the Maine House of Representatives each appoint three commissioners. The chairs of the state's two major political parties (i.e., the Republican and Democratic parties) each appoint one member. The aforementioned 12 commissioners appoint two more members from the public, "with each party's representatives coordinating to choose one commissioner." The two public commissioners appoint one additional member. This commission may make recommendations to the state legislature regarding redistricting, but the legislature is not bound to abide by the commission's recommendations.
If the state legislature is unable to pass a redistricting plan, the responsibility falls to the Maine Supreme Court . [12] State statutes require that congressional districts be compact and contiguous, In addition, state laws require that congressional districts "cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible." [12] The Maine Constitution mandates that state legislative districts be "compact and contiguous, and that they cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible."

Voters enacted the Maine Term Limits Act in 1993. That initiative said that Maine representatives are subject to term limits of no more than four two-year terms, or a total of eight years. The first year that the term limits enacted in 1993 impacted the ability of incumbents to run for office was in 1996. [16] Vacancies Vacancies If there is a vacancy in the Maine State Legislature , a special election must be held to fill the vacant seat. [17] [18] The governor must call for an election and inform political committees of the nomination deadline. [19] [17] [18] The person elected to the seat serves for the remainder of the unexpired term. [20] See sources: Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, § 382 Maine Rev. Stat.

The state Senate has 35 districts and the state House has 151 districts. Three Native American tribes, the Penobscot Nation, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, are allocated one non-voting member each in the House. [21] Use the interactive map below to find your district.   Redistricting Redistricting In Maine, both congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the state legislature. An advisory commission is also involved in the process. A two-thirds majority is required to approve new district maps, which are subject to veto by the governor . [22] The composition of the 15-member advisory redistricting commission is as follows: [22] The majority and minority leaders of the Maine State Senate each select two commissioners. The majority and minority leaders of the Maine House of Representatives each appoint three commissioners. The chairs of the state's two major political parties (i.e., the Republican and Democratic parties) each appoint one member. The aforementioned 12 commissioners appoint two more members from the public, "with each party's representatives coordinating to choose one commissioner." The two public commissioners appoint one additional member. This commission may make recommendations to the state legislature regarding redistricting, but the legislature is not bound to abide by the commission's recommendations.
If the state legislature is unable to pass a redistricting plan, the responsibility falls to the Maine Supreme Court . [22] State statutes require that congressional districts be compact and contiguous, In addition, state laws require that congressional districts "cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible." [22] The Maine Constitution mandates that state legislative districts be "compact and contiguous, and that they cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible." [22] 2020 2020 On September 29, 2021, Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed legislation enacting redrawn state legislative district boundaries. The Maine Apportionment Commission approved final maps and submitted them to the legislature on September 27, 2021.  The Maine Senate unanimously approved both maps by a vote of 31-0. The Maine House of Representatives approved new district boundaries for the state Senate by a vote of 129-0 and new state House district boundaries by a vote of 119-10. [23] These maps took effect for Maine’s 2022 legislative elections. The Maine Wire reported, "The legislature made no changes to the maps the Apportionment Commission submitted, but some legislators did express dissatisfaction with the way districts had been drawn." [24] Some lawmakers objected to changes made to the composition of their districts, such as Ben Collings (D). After the plans were approved, Collings said, "“I did my best to work with the [apportionment] committee and use the process to make those changes.” “Unfortunately that did not come together for the district I represent.” [23] District map before and after 2020 redistricting District map before and after 2020 redistricting Below is the state House map in effect before and after the 2020 redistricting cycle.

The Legislature held a special session on October 23 over a food sovereignty law and funding for the state mapping agency. The Legislature met in special session on November 6 over Gov. LePage's veto of a bill that would legalize the sale of recreational marijuana. The House did not have enough votes to override the veto. Click [show] to read about the 2017 partial government shutdown. A partial government shutdown ended in Maine on July 4, 2017, after Governor Paul LePage signed a $7.1 billion, two-year budget passed by the legislature.  The final compromises were over the elimination of a proposed lodging tax increase and the allocation of additional money for public education.  House Republicans were able to see the removal of an increase in the lodging tax from 9 percent to 10.5 percent.  Democrats got additional funding to Head Start and Clean Election programs, as well as $162 million to go towards K-12 spending. [26] Non-essential government services—such as state parks and Bureau of Motor Vehicle offices—were shut down after a budget had not been signed by July 1.  The last time Maine’s government shutdown was a 16-day shutdown in 1991. [27] The 2017 shutdown was resolved after three days.  Maine’s legislative session was originally scheduled to end on June 21, but lawmakers voted to extend the 2017 legislative session by five days, not required to be concurrent.  The cost of the five-day extension of the session was estimated to be $94,600. [28] The key issue throughout much of Maine’s 2017 legislative session was a voter approved ballot measure called Question 2 , which authorized an additional 3 percent tax on the portion of any household income exceeding $200,000 per year and earmarked the revenue to fund public education. The budget deal included the repeal of Question 2. Click [show] to read about the 2017 veto session. In a veto session on August 2, 2017, the Maine State Legislature voted to sustain 14 vetoes issued by Gov. Paul LePage (R) and to override 13 others. Included in the legislation that the Legislature voted in favor of was a bill increasing the legal age for buying tobacco products from 18 to 21, making Maine the fifth state to up its age limit for buying products such as cigarettes. Included in the legislation that Legislature voted against—i.e. to uphold the veto—was a bill prohibiting the use of handheld electronic devices such as cell phones while driving. Maine is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. LePage criticized both bills when they arrived on his desk, calling them social engineering. “I don’t believe that social engineering a society is going to create a good society,” LePage said in a radio interview in July. Supporters of these bills have said that raising the age to purchase tobacco products could make individuals less likely to start smoking and that prohibiting the use of handheld electronic devices while driving could decrease traffic accidents. As of June 2017, 15 states banned the use of handheld devices while driving. Other vetoes that the Legislature voted to override included legislation related to filling vacancies in the state’s public health nursing system and legislation related to opioid addiction services. Vetoes that the Legislature voted to sustain included legislation related solar energy and insurance coverage for individuals with mental health issues.

Major issues in 2013 Major issues in the 2013 legislative session included addressing education, energy, domestic violence, jobs, strengthening the state's economy, and a new two-year budget that was facing a $128 million deficit. [32] Election of constitutional officers The Maine House of Representatives voted 79-59 on June 4 to reject a proposal to allow voters to select the state’s Treasurer , Secretary of State , and Attorney General . LD 1279 called for a referendum to amend the Maine State Constitution to shift the selection of these officers from the Legislature to voters. [33] The bill sponsored by Representative Andre Cushing (R) called for two-year terms for the Treasurer and Secretary of State and a four-year term for the Attorney General. At the time, legislators selected all three officers every two years. This legislation was blocked on June 3 by the Maine State Senate 18-16. [34] The House and Senate votes largely followed party lines with Democratic majorities in both houses. Republican majorities in the House and Senate blocked similar legislation in 2011. [35] [36] 2012 See also: Dates of 2012 state legislative sessions In 2012, the legislature was in session from January 4 through May 31.

[38] On June 16, Governor Paul LePage ordered lawmakers home for 12 days, only to return to the statehouse for a special veto session to begin June 28. [39] The GOP legislature and Republican Governor Paul LePage agreed on a fiscal year 2012 budget late in the session, with LePage signing the final bill on June 20. The final deal cut taxes by $150 million, lowering the top income tax rate from 8.5% to 7.95% and taking 70,000 low-income citizens off the income tax rolls entirely. Dirigo Health, an "experiment in near-universal health care," would be phased out entirely by the beginning of 2014. LePage's first budget also cut government financial aid programs including benefits for legal noncitizens and limited participation in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to five years.

Democrats got additional funding to Head Start and Clean Election programs, as well as $162 million to go towards K-12 spending. [26] Non-essential government services—such as state parks and Bureau of Motor Vehicle offices—were shut down after a budget had not been signed by July 1.  The last time Maine’s government shutdown was a 16-day shutdown in 1991. [27] The 2017 shutdown was resolved after three days.  Maine’s legislative session was originally scheduled to end on June 21, but lawmakers voted to extend the 2017 legislative session by five days, not required to be concurrent.  The cost of the five-day extension of the session was estimated to be $94,600. [28] The key issue throughout much of Maine’s 2017 legislative session was a voter approved ballot measure called Question 2 , which authorized an additional 3 percent tax on the portion of any household income exceeding $200,000 per year and earmarked the revenue to fund public education. The budget deal included the repeal of Question 2. A partial government shutdown ended in Maine on July 4, 2017, after Governor Paul LePage signed a $7.1 billion, two-year budget passed by the legislature.

Paul LePage (R) and to override 13 others. Included in the legislation that the Legislature voted in favor of was a bill increasing the legal age for buying tobacco products from 18 to 21, making Maine the fifth state to up its age limit for buying products such as cigarettes. Included in the legislation that Legislature voted against—i.e. to uphold the veto—was a bill prohibiting the use of handheld electronic devices such as cell phones while driving. Maine is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. LePage criticized both bills when they arrived on his desk, calling them social engineering. “I don’t believe that social engineering a society is going to create a good society,” LePage said in a radio interview in July. Supporters of these bills have said that raising the age to purchase tobacco products could make individuals less likely to start smoking and that prohibiting the use of handheld electronic devices while driving could decrease traffic accidents. As of June 2017, 15 states banned the use of handheld devices while driving. Other vetoes that the Legislature voted to override included legislation related to filling vacancies in the state’s public health nursing system and legislation related to opioid addiction services. Vetoes that the Legislature voted to sustain included legislation related solar energy and insurance coverage for individuals with mental health issues.

[32] Election of constitutional officers Election of constitutional officers The Maine House of Representatives voted 79-59 on June 4 to reject a proposal to allow voters to select the state’s Treasurer , Secretary of State , and Attorney General . LD 1279 called for a referendum to amend the Maine State Constitution to shift the selection of these officers from the Legislature to voters. [33] The bill sponsored by Representative Andre Cushing (R) called for two-year terms for the Treasurer and Secretary of State and a four-year term for the Attorney General. At the time, legislators selected all three officers every two years. This legislation was blocked on June 3 by the Maine State Senate 18-16. [34] The House and Senate votes largely followed party lines with Democratic majorities in both houses. Republican majorities in the House and Senate blocked similar legislation in 2011.

[38] On June 16, Governor Paul LePage ordered lawmakers home for 12 days, only to return to the statehouse for a special veto session to begin June 28. [39] The GOP legislature and Republican Governor Paul LePage agreed on a fiscal year 2012 budget late in the session, with LePage signing the final bill on June 20. The final deal cut taxes by $150 million, lowering the top income tax rate from 8.5% to 7.95% and taking 70,000 low-income citizens off the income tax rolls entirely. Dirigo Health, an "experiment in near-universal health care," would be phased out entirely by the beginning of 2014. LePage's first budget also cut government financial aid programs including benefits for legal noncitizens and limited participation in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to five years. [40] 2010 2010 In 2010, the legislature was in session from January 6 to April 12.  About legislative sessions in Maine About legislative sessions in Maine The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution declares that any power not already given to the federal government is reserved to the states and the people. [41] State governments across the country use this authority to hold legislative sessions where a state's elected representatives meet for a period of time to draft and vote on legislation and set state policies on issues such as taxation, education, and government spending. The different types of legislation passed by a legislature may include resolutions, legislatively referred constitutional amendments , and bills that become law. Article IV, Part Third of the Maine Constitution establishes when the Maine State Legislature , of which the House of Representatives is a part, is to be in session.  Section 1 of the Part states that, following a legislative election, the Legislature is to convene its first regular session on the first Wednesday of December.  The second regular session of the legislature is to convene in the next even-numbered year.  This second session is to convene on the first Wednesday after the first Tuesday in January.  Section 1 also instructs the Legislature to enact statutory limits on the length of its regular sessions. Section 1 also establishes the procedures for convening special sessions of the Legislature.  A special session can be convened by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, with the consent of a majority of legislators from each political party. [42] Legislative roles and procedures Legislative roles and procedures Every state legislature throughout the country features its own internal procedures that it uses to govern itself and how it interacts with other parts of state government. Ballotpedia's coverage of internal state legislative procedures includes veto overrides , the role of the legislature in the state budget , term limits , procedures for filling membership vacancies , and redistricting . Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Maine are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers. Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 101 of the 151 members in the Maine House of Representatives and 24 of the 35 members in the Maine State Senate . Maine is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Authority: Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Maine Constitution . "Every bill or resolution, having the force of law, to which the concurrence of both Houses may be necessary, except on a question of adjournment, which shall have passed both Houses, shall be presented to the Governor, and if the Governor approves, the Governor shall sign it; if not, the Governor shall return it with objections to the House in which it shall have originated, which shall enter the objections at large on its journals, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration, 2/3 of that House shall agree to pass it, it shall be sent together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall be reconsidered, and, if approved by 2/3 of that House, it shall have the same effect as if it had been signed by the Governor; but in all such cases, the votes of both Houses shall be taken by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons, voting for and against the bill or resolution, shall be entered on the journals of both Houses respectively." Role in state budget Role in state budget Maine on Maine on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions The state operates on a biennial budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [43] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies in July of the year preceding the start of the new biennium. State agencies submit their budget requests by September 1 . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the state legislature in January . This deadline is extended to February for a newly elected governor. The legislature adopts a budget by 30 days prior to its adjournment . A simple majority is required to pass a budget. The biennium begins on July 1 . Maine is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [43] [44] The governor is legally required to submit a balanced budget proposal. Likewise, the state legislature is legally required to pass a balanced budget. [43] Committees Committees Every state legislature and state legislative chamber in the country contains several legislative committees. These committees are responsible for studying, amending, and voting on legislation before it reaches the floor of a chamber for a full vote. The different types of committees include standing committees, select or special, and joint. Standing committees are generally permanent committees, the names of which sometimes change from session to session. Select or special committees are temporary committees formed to deal with specific issues such as recent legislation, major public policy or proposals, or investigations. Joint committees are committees that feature members of both chambers of a legislature. Ballotpedia covers standing and joint committees. The Maine House of Representatives has  six  standing  committees: Bills in the Second Reading Committee Elections Committee Ethics Committee House Engrossed Bills Committee Leaves of Absence Committee Rules and Business of the House Committee  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Maine Constitution can be amended: The Maine Constitution may be amended in two ways—through the legislative process, or a state constitutional convention. Maine residents cannot put a constitutional amendment on the ballot through the power of initiative . Maine does feature the power of initiative for initiated state statutes . Legislature Legislature A two-thirds majority (66.67%) vote is required during one legislative session for the Maine State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 101 votes in the Maine House of Representatives and 24 votes in the Maine State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention According to Section 15 of Part III of Article IV, the legislature can, by a two-thirds concurrent vote of both branches, call a constitutional convention. Maine has never called such a convention; however, two "constitutional commissions" were impaneled, one in 1876 and one in 1962, but neither led to significant changes.

The previous incumbent, Benjamin T. Bartlett IV (R), resigned on April 26, 2023, due to health concerns. [1] The partisan composition on the day of the election was 198-196. Rafter's victory on the evening of September 19 brought the partisan composition to 198-197. On August 13, 2023, the partisan composition of the New Hampshire House was 199 Republicans, 196 Democrats, two independents, and three vacancies. David Fracht (D) filled the first vacancy after being elected to Grafton 16 on  August 22, bringing the partisan composition to 199-197 with two vacancies. Two additional House vacancies occurred when William Hatch (D) and Troy Merner (R) resigned on September 18 and 19, respectively. [2] Only one of the remaining three vacancies, Hillsborough 3 , was scheduled for special election as of this writing on September 19. A Democratic victory in this district would bring the House's partisan composition to an even 198-198, while a Republican victory would result in a 199-197 split (with two independents and two vacancies). Rafter was a partner for Waterline, an organization that provides river flow information for boaters and anglers. He previously worked for New Hampshire Housing for more than 35 years, and had served on the Nottingham School Board for eight years and the Nottingham Board of Selectmen for three years. Rafter said, "This election is important because the outcome could result in a NH House that is divided equally between Democrats and Republicans. ... If you are concerned about Republican attacks on education, women’s rights, voting rights, and their lack of attention to climate change, this election can make a difference." [3] Guzofski was a Northwood selectman and a chaplain for the Northwood Fire Department. He had been in the ministry for 34 years. Guzofski said, "I have been elected twice to the office of selectman in Northwood dedicated to keep your taxes low. As selectman I have implemented plans for better communication between town officials and you. ... For years I have served our Nottingham and Northwood community, fighting for your needs in town." [4] In 2020 , former President Donald Trump (R) carried Rockingham 1 49.1% to 48.7%. [5] In 2022 , U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) won the district 50% to 48%, while Democrats lost one of the district's three state House seats by 10 votes. [5] Heading into the election, New Hampshire had been a Republican trifecta since 2020. If Democrats won all three special elections, the state House would have split and New Hampshire's trifecta status would become divided. The state would remain a Republican trifecta if Democrats did not win all three special elections.

Generally, members from even-numbered districts are elected in U.S. presidential election years (2012, 2008, 2004, etc.) and members from odd-numbered districts are elected in general election years offset by two years from U.S. presidential elections (2010, 2006, 2002, etc.). North Dakota legislators assume office December 1st. [1] Qualifications Qualifications Article 4, Section 5 of the North Dakota Constitution states: “ Each individual elected or appointed to the legislative assembly must be, on the day of the election or appointment, a qualified elector in the district from which the member was selected and must have been a resident of the state for one year immediately prior to that election. An individual may not serve in the legislative assembly unless the individual lives in the district from which selected. [2] [3] ” Salaries Salaries $592/month $213/day Term limits Term limits The North Dakota Legislative Assembly is one of 16 state legislatures with term limits . It has been a term-limited state legislature since North Dakota voters approved Constitutional Measure 1 in 2022 , as an initiated constitutional amendment . The first year that the term limits enacted in 2022 will impact the ability of incumbents to run for office is 2030. Under North Dakota's term limits, state representatives can serve no more than two four-year terms. Vacancies Vacancies If there is a vacancy in the North Dakota State Legislature , the vacancy is filled by the district committee of the political party that holds the seat.  A replacement must be named within 21 days of the vacancy.  The appointed person shall serve until the next general election which is scheduled for at least 94 days after the vacancy occurs. Qualified electors in a district where a vacancy exists can also petition for a special election to be called by the governor to fill the remaining term. [5] See sources: North Dakota Cent. Code §44-02-03.1 See sources: North Dakota Cent. Code §44-02-03.1  District map District map Redistricting Redistricting Because North Dakota has only one congressional district, congressional redistricting is not necessary. The state legislature draws state legislative district boundaries. State legislative district lines are subject to veto by the governor . [6] The North Dakota Constitution requires that state legislative districts be "compact and contiguous." [6] [7] 2020-2024 2020-2024 On January 8, 2024, the U.S. District Court of North Dakota ordered the state to adopt a remedial legislative map proposed by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe. In the order, Judge Peter Welte said that the new map "requires changes to only three districts ... and is the least intrusive option that complies with the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution." [8] [9] The U.S. District Court of North Dakota struck down the state's legislative map on November 17, 2023, saying in its ruling in the case Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. the Secretary of State of North Dakota , "The Secretary is permanently enjoined from administering, enforcing, preparing for, or in any way permitting the nomination or election of members of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly from districts 9 and 15 and subdistrict 9A and 9B. The Secretary and Legislative Assembly shall have until December 22, 2023, to adopt a plan to remedy the violation of Section 2." [10] North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) signed legislation enacting the state's legislative map on November 11, 2021. Reactions to 2024 state legislative maps Reactions to 2024 state legislative maps On January 9, 2024, the Secretary of State’s Office filed an appeal with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota's order in the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. the Secretary of State of North Dakota case. [11] The Secretary of State’s Office also released a statement saying, “Any action taken by the appeals court would not impact the maps used for the 2024 election cycle. ... Secretary of State Michael Howe will be moving forward for the 2024 election with Judge Welte’s court-imposed map.” [11] Below are the maps in effect before and after the 2020 redistricting cycle.

Leadership Positions in State Legislatures President of the Senate • President Pro Tempore • Senate Majority Leader • Senate Minority Leader • House Majority Leader • House Minority Leader • State Speaker of the House The president of the senate is a title frequently given in state legislatures to the presiding officer of a state senate. State senate presidents preside over legislative sessions and ensure that members of the chamber abide by procedural rules. In many states, the lieutenant governor serves as the president of the senate, while a state senator assumes the role of president pro tempore . In other cases, the president of the senate is a state senator elected by the members of the chamber. At the federal level, the vice president of the United States serves as the president of the United States Senate . [1] The president of the senate presides over legislative sessions and ensures that senators abide by procedural rules. The president of the senate is the primary leader of the senate. In some states, the lieutenant governor serves as the president of the senate. In other states, the president of the senate is a state senator elected from among the body. In the absence of the Senate president, many of the position's responsibilities are carried out by the president pro tempore .

Leadership at the state legislative level refers to a range of different positions, including senate presidents and presidents pro tempore , house and assembly speakers , and minority and majority leaders . There are also middle- and lower-level leadership positions, such as whips, deputies, and floor leaders. Voters typically have little direct say in who holds these positions. Instead, the legislators themselves usually select their leaders. While the power and authority—and even the names—of leadership positions vary from chamber-to-chamber and state-to-state, leaders in state legislatures generally play influential roles in four, often interconnected, areas: the legislative process , elections , management , and career advancement .

Read more about state legislative leadership positions here . The president of the senate is the primary leader of the senate body. Responsibilities that generally come with the position include presiding over legislative sessions and ensuring that senators abide by procedural rules. In the absence of the Senate president, many of the position's responsibilities are carried out by the president pro tempore . The lieutenant governor serves as the president of the senate in 26 states. In other states, the president of the senate is a state senator chosen by the members of the chamber. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some states, such as Ohio and Rhode Island , removed the role of president of the senate from the duties of the lieutenant governor and instituted a process to select the senate president from among the members of the Senate body. [2] [3] [4] Though "president of the senate" is the most common title for the senate leader, not all states adhere to the norm. For example, the Tennessee State Senate refers to its Senate leader as the speaker. In addition, Tennessee and West Virginia bestow the title of lieutenant governor on the senate leader, who is selected by the members of the chamber. [5] [6] History History The modern role of president of the senate is rooted in the lieutenant governorships of the colonial era. During that period, lieutenant governors often presided over the governors' councils, which existed in each colony and functioned as the upper houses of government in colonies with a bicameral legislature. After states gained their independence, the lieutenant governor often presided over the state senate. For example, New York 's 1777 constitution called for a lieutenant governor "who presides in the senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor in casualties similar to those, which would authorise the vice president to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the president." [7] [8] [9] In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some states, such as Ohio and Rhode Island, removed the role of president of the senate from the duties of the lieutenant governor and instituted a process of selection through which the senate president is elected by the senators from among the members of the senate body. [2] [10] State vs. federal State vs. federal At the federal level, the vice president of the United States serves as the president of the U.S. Senate. In this capacity, the vice president presides over the Senate sessions and casts tie-breaking votes when necessary. [1] At the state level, lieutenant governors or state senators serve as senate presidents. Specific duties and voting powers vary by state. Responsibilities Responsibilities The president of the senate is the principal leader of the Senate. Though specific duties of the position vary in senate chambers across the country, the president of the senate may assume any or all of the following duties: [11] [2] [12] [13] [14] Calls the chamber to order Presides over the Senate sessions and joint sessions of the House and Senate Ensures that members abide by the chamber's rules Oversees the legislative process Decides questions of order Recognizes speakers Declares votes Appoints committee chairs and members Selects the Senate majority leader Administers oaths Votes Votes The president of the senate's voting powers vary by state. The president may vote according to one of the following scenarios: Tie-breaking votes only The president of the senate may only cast a vote on questions in order to resolve a tie. This scenario is most common in states where the lieutenant governor serves as president of the senate. [11] [5] [15] [16] Full voting privileges The president of the senate may vote on all questions put before the legislative body. This scenario is most common in states where the president of the senate is a state senator chosen from among the members of the chamber. [2] Full voting privileges, but only tie-breaking votes are required The president of the senate may vote on any question put before the body, but is only required to cast tie-breaking votes. [17] Tenure Tenure Selection Selection In cases where the lieutenant governor serves as the president of the senate, the position is most often elected by voters in the state every four years during the general election. [18] In the remaining states, the president of the senate is a state senator elected by the members of the chamber. Depending on the state, these leaders serve two-year or four-year terms. [12] [5] Term limits Term limits Lieutenant governors and state senators who serve as senate presidents are subject to any applicable term limits on elected offices in their respective states. Specific term limits on legislative leadership positions exist in Illinois and New York . In Illinois , a state senator can serve as president of the senate for a maximum of 10 years. In New York , the Senate president pro tempore is limited to an eight-year term. [19] [20] About state leadership positions About state leadership positions State legislative leadership refers to a range of different positions, including senate presidents and presidents pro tempore , house and assembly speakers , and minority and majority leaders . These positions are typically elected by the full membership of the chamber instead of by the public at large. Although the power and titles of leadership positions vary between states, these leaders all play a role in the legislative process.

No person may be a candidate for election as a member of the House of Representatives unless, at the time of the nomination for placement on a primary, general or special election ballot, that person is a resident in the district which the candidate seeks to represent." [4] Salaries Salaries $16,245.12 for the first regular session. $11,668.32 for the second regular session. $70/day for lodging (or round-trip mileage up to $0.55/mile in lieu of housing, plus tolls). $50/day for meals. Term limits Term limits The Maine legislature is one of 16 state legislatures with term limits . Voters enacted the Maine Term Limits Act in 1993. That initiative said that Maine representatives are subject to term limits of no more than four two-year terms, or a total of eight years. The first year that the term limits enacted in 1993 impacted the ability of incumbents to run for office was in 1996. [1]  Vacancies Vacancies If there is a vacancy in the Maine State Legislature , a special election must be held to fill the vacant seat. [6] [7] The governor must call for an election and inform political committees of the nomination deadline. [8] [6] [7] The person elected to the seat serves for the remainder of the unexpired term. [9] See sources: Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, § 382 Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, §366 and Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, § 381 See sources: Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, § 382 Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, §366 and Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, § 381  2016 pivot county 2016 pivot county This district was one of 710 state legislative districts that, based on boundaries adopted after the 2010 census, intersected with one or more Pivot Counties .  These 206 Pivot Counties voted for Donald Trump (R) in 2016 after voting for Barack Obama (D) in 2008 and 2012. The 206 Pivot Counties were located in 34 states. Iowa, with 31, had the most such counties.  At that time, the partisan makeup of state legislative districts intersecting with Pivot Counties was slightly more Republican than the overall partisan makeup of state legislatures throughout the country. [10] District map District map Redistricting Redistricting 2020-2022 2020-2022 On September 29, 2021, Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed legislation enacting redrawn state legislative district boundaries. The Maine Apportionment Commission approved final maps and submitted them to the legislature on September 27, 2021.  The Maine Senate unanimously approved both maps by a vote of 31-0. The Maine House of Representatives approved new district boundaries for the state Senate by a vote of 129-0 and new state House district boundaries by a vote of 119-10. [11] These maps took effect for Maine’s 2022 legislative elections. The Maine Wire reported, "The legislature made no changes to the maps the Apportionment Commission submitted, but some legislators did express dissatisfaction with the way districts had been drawn." [12] Some lawmakers objected to changes made to the composition of their districts, such as Ben Collings (D). After the plans were approved, Collings said, "“I did my best to work with the [apportionment] committee and use the process to make those changes.” “Unfortunately that did not come together for the district I represent.” [11] How does redistricting in Maine work? In Maine, both congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the state legislature. An advisory commission is also involved in the process. A two-thirds majority is required to approve new district maps, which are subject to veto by the governor . [13] The composition of the 15-member advisory redistricting commission is as follows: [13] The majority and minority leaders of the Maine State Senate each select two commissioners. The majority and minority leaders of the Maine House of Representatives each appoint three commissioners. The chairs of the state's two major political parties (i.e., the Republican and Democratic parties) each appoint one member. The aforementioned 12 commissioners appoint two more members from the public, "with each party's representatives coordinating to choose one commissioner." The two public commissioners appoint one additional member. This commission may make recommendations to the state legislature regarding redistricting, but the legislature is not bound to abide by the commission's recommendations.
If the state legislature is unable to pass a redistricting plan, the responsibility falls to the Maine Supreme Court . [13] State statutes require that congressional districts be compact and contiguous, In addition, state laws require that congressional districts "cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible." [13] The Maine Constitution mandates that state legislative districts be "compact and contiguous, and that they cross political subdivision lines as few times as possible."

Scorecards Scorecards A scorecard evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.  To contribute to the list of Georgia scorecards, email suggestions to editor@ballotpedia.org .  2024 2024 In 2024, the Georgia State Legislature was in session from January 8 to March 28.

Districts must "utilize existing geographic or political boundaries." Districts should not "divide communities of common interest." Districts should "be connected by transportation links." Districts "must not be drawn for the purpose of favoring a political party, incumbent or other person." 2020 2020 Gov. Kate Brown (D) signed new state legislative maps into law on September 27, 2021.

[21]  About legislative sessions in Oregon About legislative sessions in Oregon The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution declares that any power not already given to the federal government is reserved to the states and the people. [22] State governments across the country use this authority to hold legislative sessions where a state's elected representatives meet for a period of time to draft and vote on legislation and set state policies on issues such as taxation, education, and government spending. The different types of legislation passed by a legislature may include resolutions, legislatively referred constitutional amendments , and bills that become law. Article IV of the Oregon Constitution establishes when the Oregon State Legislature , of which the Senate is a part, is to meet.  Section 10 of Article IV states that the Legislature will meet in regular session once every two years.  The section goes on to establish starting dates for these sessions, but these dates have been changed by law (as the section allows). Section 10 of Article IV also requires the presiding officers of both legislative houses to convene an emergency session of the Legislature when a majority of the members of each house request an emergency session. Legislative roles and procedures Legislative roles and procedures Every state legislature throughout the country features its own internal procedures that it uses to govern itself and how it interacts with other parts of state government. Ballotpedia's coverage of internal state legislative procedures includes veto overrides , the role of the legislature in the state budget , and procedures for filling membership vacancies . Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Oregon are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers. Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 40 of the 60 members in the Oregon House of Representatives and 20 of the 30 members in the Oregon State Senate . Oregon is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. How can vetoes be overridden after the legislature has adjourned? Vetoes can be overridden in a special session or when the next regular session convenes. [23] [24] A majority of members in both chambers must agree to call for a special session. [25] Authority: Article V, Section 15b of the Oregon Constitution . "(1) Every bill which shall have passed the Legislative Assembly shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor; if the Governor approve, the Governor shall sign it; but if not, the Governor shall return it with written objections to that house in which it shall have originated, which house shall enter the objections at large upon the journal and proceed to reconsider it. (2) If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members present shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of the members present, it shall become a law."

Committees Committees Every state legislature and state legislative chamber in the country contains several legislative committees. These committees are responsible for studying, amending, and voting on legislation before it reaches the floor of a chamber for a full vote. The different types of committees include standing committees, select or special, and joint. Standing committees are generally permanent committees, the names of which sometimes change from session to session. Select or special committees are temporary committees formed to deal with specific issues such as recent legislation, major public policy or proposals, or investigations. Joint committees are committees that feature members of both chambers of a legislature. Ballotpedia covers standing and joint committees. The Oregon State Senate has  13  standing  committees: Finance and Revenue Committee Housing and Development Committee Human Services, Mental Health and Recovery Committee Judiciary and Ballot Measure 110 Implementation Committee Labor and Business Committee Natural Resources and Wildlife Recovery Committee Senate Conduct Committee Senate Education Committee Senate Energy and Environment Committee Senate Health Care Committee Senate Redistricting Committee Senate Rules Committee Veterans and Emergency Preparedness Committee  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Oregon Constitution can be amended: The Oregon Constitution lays out four different paths, in two different articles, for how to go about changing the state's constitution. The constitutional revision process is established in Section 2 of Article XVII . Section 1, Article IV, says that the people of the state can use an initiated constitutional amendment to put an amendment before voters. An initiated amendment must be proposed "by a petition signed by a number of qualified voters equal to eight percent of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor at the election at which a Governor was elected for a term of four years next preceding the filing of the petition." The petition must include the full text of the proposed amendment. The signatures must be filed "not less than four months before the election at which the proposed...amendment to the Constitution is to be voted upon." Article IV contains several restrictions on the initiative process such as Section 1b , which prohibits pay-per-signature . Section 1 of Article XVIII creates the procedures by which the Oregon State Legislature can use a legislatively referred constitutional amendment to put an amendment before voters. Amendments can be proposed in either house of the state legislature. To earn a spot on the ballot, a "majority of all the members elected to each of the two houses" must vote in favor of a proposed amendment. The Legislature can put any such referred amendments on a special election ballot. If more than one amendment is proposed by the legislature, they must be voted on separately. Section 1 of Article XVIII also states that a constitutional convention can only be held if "the law providing for such convention shall first be approved by the people on a referendum vote at a regular general election." The constitution does not define how such a referendum is to be put before voters. Possible ways might include a citizen-initiated question or a vote of the legislature.

The state Senate has 40 districts and the state House has 125 districts. Use the interactive map below to find your district.   Redistricting Redistricting In Kansas, the state legislature draws both congressional and state legislative district lines. Redistricting plans are subject to veto by the governor . State legislative district maps must be submitted for final approval to the Kansas Supreme Court , which must determine whether the maps are constitutional. If the court rules that the maps violate the law, the state legislature may attempt to draw the lines again. There are no such provisions in place for congressional redistricting. [13] In 2002, Kansas adopted guidelines for congressional and state legislative redistricting. These guidelines ask that "both congressional and state legislative districts be contiguous, as compact as possible, and recognize and consider communities of common 'social, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic' interests." In addition, these guidelines stipulate that state legislative districts should "preserve existing political subdivisions and avoid contests between incumbents to the extent possible." Congressional districts should "preserve whole counties and maintain the core of existing districts where possible." The state legislature may amend these guidelines at its discretion. [13] 2020 2020 Kansas enacted legislative district boundaries on May 18, 2022, when the Kansas Supreme Court unanimously upheld the validity of the legislative districts that Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) signed into law on April 15, 2022. [14] [15] Both chambers of the legislature passed the redistricting legislation on March 30, 2022, after a joint House-Senate conference committee had developed it. [16] The Kansas House of Representatives approved the legislative boundaries, 83-40, and the State Senate approved them, 29-11. [16] After Kelly signed the maps, Andrew Bahl and Rafael Garcia of the Topeka Capital-Journal wrote, "The state Senate and House maps were mildly contested in the Legislature, particularly in the Senate where the map will create a fourth, Democrat-leaning district in Topeka and Lawrence."

The state grew by 6.1 percent to over 2.58 million, with growth concentrated in the northeast corner of the state and the remainder largely showing slight declines. [18] Wichita grew by 11.1 percent, Overland Park grew by 16.3 percent, Kansas City decreased by 0.7 percent, Topeka grew by 4.2 percent, and Olathe grew by 35.4 percent. [19] The Legislature attempted redistricting in its 2012 session.  Traditionally, the chambers passed their own maps. In 2012, the Senate passed revisions to a new House map, and the House passed a map for the Senate; neither chamber was amenable to the other's actions. On May 20, the Legislature adjourned amid deadlock, asking the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to intervene and draw congressional and state legislative district lines. On June 7, 2012, the court approved the new district maps.

[31]  About legislative sessions in Kansas About legislative sessions in Kansas The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution declares that any power not already given to the federal government is reserved to the states and the people. [32] State governments across the country use this authority to hold legislative sessions where a state's elected representatives meet for a period of time to draft and vote on legislation and set state policies on issues such as taxation, education, and government spending. The different types of legislation passed by a legislature may include resolutions, legislatively referred constitutional amendments , and bills that become law. Article 2 of the Kansas Constitution establishes when the Kansas State Legislature , of which the Senate is a part, is to be in session.  Section 8 of Article 2 states that the Legislature is to convene on the second Monday of January of each year.  Section 8 also limits the length of regular sessions in even-numbered years to ninety calendar days, but it allows these sessions to be extended by a two-thirds affirmative vote of both houses. In 2010, this kind of extension occurred, moving the session's adjournment date from March 30th to May 28th. Legislative roles and procedures Legislative roles and procedures Every state legislature throughout the country features its own internal procedures that it uses to govern itself and how it interacts with other parts of state government. Ballotpedia's coverage of internal state legislative procedures includes veto overrides , the role of the legislature in the state budget , procedures for filling membership vacancies , and redistricting . Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Kansas are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members in both chambers. Two-thirds of members in both chambers must vote to override a veto, which is 84 of the 125 members in the Kansas House of Representatives and 27 of the 40 members in the Kansas State Senate . Kansas is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Authority: Article 2, Section 14 of the Kansas Constitution . "If the governor approves a bill, he shall sign it. If the governor does not approve a bill, the governor shall veto it by returning the bill, with a veto message of the objections, to the house of origin of the bill. Whenever a veto message is so received, the message shall be entered in the journal and in not more than thirty calendar days (excluding the day received), the house of origin shall reconsider the bill. If two-thirds of the members then elected (or appointed) and qualified shall vote to pass the bill, it shall be sent, with the veto message, to the other house, which shall in not more than thirty calendar days (excluding the day received) also reconsider the bill, and if approved by two-thirds of the members then elected (or appointed) and qualified, it shall become a law, notwithstanding the governor's veto." Role in state budget Role in state budget Kansas on Kansas on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions The state operates on an annual budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [33] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies in June . State agencies submit their budget requests to the governor in September . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the state legislature in January . The legislature typically adopts a budget in May . A simple majority is required to adopt a budget. The fiscal year begins in July . Kansas is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [33] [34] The governor is legally required to submit a balanced proposed budget. Likewise, the legislature is legally required to pass a balanced budget. [33] Committees Committees Every state legislature and state legislative chamber in the country contains several legislative committees. These committees are responsible for studying, amending, and voting on legislation before it reaches the floor of a chamber for a full vote. The different types of committees include standing committees, select or special, and joint. Standing committees are generally permanent committees, the names of which sometimes change from session to session. Select or special committees are temporary committees formed to deal with specific issues such as recent legislation, major public policy or proposals, or investigations. Joint committees are committees that feature members of both chambers of a legislature. Ballotpedia covers standing and joint committees. The Kansas State Senate has  16  standing  committees: Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee Assessment and Taxation Committee Commerce Committee Confirmation Oversight Committee Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee Organization, Calendar and Rules Committee Public Health and Welfare Committee Senate Education Committee Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee Senate Interstate Cooperation Committee Senate Judiciary Committee Senate Local Government Committee Senate Transportation Committee Transparency and Ethics Committee Utilities Committee Ways and Means Committee  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the Kansas Constitution can be amended:  Ordinance • Preamble • Bill of Rights 1 • 2 • 3 • 4 • 5 • 6 • 7 • 8 • 9 • 10 • 11 • 12 • 13 • 14 • 15 Article 14 of the Kansas Constitution governs the ways in which the state's constitution can be changed over time. One path is the legislatively referred constitutional amendment .  Either house of the Kansas State Legislature can propose an amendment to the state's constitution.  Two-thirds of the members of each chamber must approve the resolution.  If they do, the proposed amendment goes on either the next statewide ballot during which members of the state legislature are elected or on a special election ballot if the legislature agrees to have a special election for this purpose. If a simple majority of the electors of the state who vote on the proposition agree with it, it becomes part of the constitution. The legislature must say what the measure's ballot title will be in their resolution authorizing it. If there is more than one proposed amendment, voters must be able to vote on them separately. At most, five amendments can be proposed for one election. An amendment is allowed to revise one entire article of the constitution "except the article on general provisions." Another path to amend the state constitution is through a constitutional convention .  If two-thirds of the members of each house of the state legislature vote in favor, the question "Shall there be a convention to amend or revise the constitution of the state of Kansas?" or "Shall there be a convention limited to revision of article(s) ________ of the constitution of the state of Kansas?" shall be placed on a statewide ballot. If a simple majority of those voting on that question say "yes," a convention is held. Any amendments or revisions that come out of the convention must go before the state's voters. Kansas does not feature the power of citizen initiative for either initiated constitutional amendments or initiated state statutes .

It consists of the lower House of Representatives and the upper State Senate . Prior to Reynolds v. Sims , the House of Representatives was apportioned so that each county had a number of representatives based on population, with each county guaranteed at least one Representative, while each county had one Senator.  Moreover, each county's General Assembly delegation also doubled as its county council. Reynolds v. Sims caused district lines to cross county lines, causing legislators to be on multiple county councils.  This led to the passage of the Home Rule Act of 1975, which created county councils that were independent of the General Assembly.  However, some functions that in many other states are performed by county governments are still handled by county legislative delegations in South Carolina. The General Assembly meets in joint session to elect judges, with all 170 members having an equal vote in such elections. South Carolina has a Republican trifecta . The Republican Party controls the office of governor and both chambers of the state legislature. Senate Senate The South Carolina Senate is the upper house of the South Carolina General Assembly. It consists of 46 senators elected from single member districts for four-year terms at the same time as United States Presidential elections. As of the 2020 Census, South Carolina state senators represented an average of 111,407 residents .     After the 2010 Census, each member represented 100,999 residents . The South Carolina Constitution of 1895 provided for each county to elect one senator for a four-year term. The election of senators was staggered so that half of the state Senate was elected every two years. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1964 for the case Reynolds v. Sims , the state Senate was reapportioned in 1966 as a temporary measure into 27 districts with 50 members for two-year terms. In 1967, the state Senate was again reapportioned, this time into 20 districts with 46 members for four-year terms. The number of districts was reduced to 16 in 1972 and in 1984, they were eliminated with the creation of single member districts. Senators serve without term limits .

[2] Major issues in 2015 Major issues in 2015 Major issues during the 2015 session included the South Carolina Supreme Court ruling on rural school equity, roads, gas prices, and criminal domestic violence.  The court issued a ruling in a 21-year-old funding lawsuit and directed the legislature to provide a solution to inequity for rural schools in the state.  However, lawmakers were given no direction by the state's highest court, and were forced to develop a plan on their own.

[7] On June 2, 2011, Governor Nikki Haley (R) attempted to call the legislature into an "emergency" special session to begin on June 7 to create the new South Carolina Department of Administration. A lawsuit was filed  by Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell (R), in which he contended that Haley's call for a special session was unconstitutional, and that it violated the state Constitution's requirement of separation of powers among the governor, legislature and courts. [8] On June 6, 2011, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled 3-2 against Governor Haley, stating that her order violated the legislature's ability to set its calendar and agenda. [9] The legislature met in a special  redistricting session from June 14 to July 1. [10] The legislature re-convened July 26.

Role in state budget Role in state budget South Carolina on South Carolina on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions The state operates on an annual budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows [12] In August of the year preceding the start of the new fiscal year, the governor sends budget instructions to state agencies. Between September and October , agencies submit their budget requests to the governor. Budget hearings are held with state agencies in October . In January , the governor submits his or her proposed budget to the state legislature . Both the House and the Senate pass a budget. If these versions do not match, a conference committee consisting of both House and Senate members is assembled to reconcile the differences. [13] The legislature adopts a budget in May . The fiscal year begins July 1 . South Carolina is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [12] [14] The governor is constitutionally required to submit a balanced budget to the legislature. In turn, the legislature must pass a balanced budget , and any budget signed into law by the governor must be balanced. [12]  District maps District maps State Senate State Senate  State House State House  Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in South Carolina are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers. Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 83 of the 124 members in the South Carolina House of Representatives and 31 of the 46 members in the South Carolina State Senate . South Carolina is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. How can vetoes be overridden after the legislature has adjourned? Vetoes can be overridden in a special session or when the next regular session convenes. [15] Authority: Article IV, Section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution . "Every bill or joint resolution which shall have passed the General Assembly, except on a question of adjournment, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor, and if he approves he shall sign it; if not, he shall return it, with his objections, to the house in which it originated, which shall enter the objections at large on its Journal and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass it, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that house it shall have the same effect as if it had been signed by the Governor; but in all such cases the vote of both houses shall be taken by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill or joint resolution shall be entered on the Journals of both houses respectively." Redistricting Redistricting In South Carolina, congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by the state legislature . These lines are subject to veto by the governor . [16] South Carolina's legislative redistricting committees adopted redistricting guidelines in 2011. These guidelines recommend that all congressional and state legislative districts be contiguous and "attempt to preserve communities of interest and cores of incumbents' existing districts." Further, the guidelines suggest that districts should "adhere to county, municipal, and voting precinct boundary lines." These guidelines may modified by the legislature at its discretion. [16] 2020 2020 South Carolina enacted new state legislative district maps on December 10, 2021, when Gov. McMaster signed a proposal approved by the South Carolina House and Senate into law. The South Carolina Senate approved House and Senate map proposals in a 43-1 vote on December 7, 2021, and the House approved the new districts in a 75-27 vote on December 9, 2021. Gov. McMaster signed the bill into law the next day. [17] The House maps were updated on June 28, 2022, by Senate Bill 1024. The updated maps became effective for the 2024 elections. [18] [19]  2010 2010 On June 15, 2011 the Senate approved its new maps by a unanimous 33-0 vote with little debate. [20] The same day, House representatives also approved their redistricting plan. [21] History History Confederate flag removed Confederate flag removed On July 9, 2015, the South Carolina State Legislature passed Senate Bill 897 , which removed the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the State House.  Senate Bill 897 had to be passed twice in each chamber by a two-thirds majority before it could be sent to the governor. [22] The Senate passed Senate Bill 897 by a vote of 37 to 3 on July 6, and by a vote of 36 to 3 on July 7. [22] [23] The House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 93 to 27 on June 8, and by a vote of 94 to 20 on July 9. [24] The final vote on the bill came in the early morning of July 9 after a 13-hour debate over the flag's removal. [25] The newly reignited debate surrounding the Confederate flag began in South Carolina after the late Democratic Senator Clementa Pinckney and eight others were killed in a mass shooting at an African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, S.C. on June 17, 2015. [26] After the shooting, the police determined that the shooter was motivated by racial hatred, and had posed in pictures with the Confederate flag. [27] The massacre reignited a debate about the meaning of the Confederate flag and its symbol to different people. [28] Gov. Nikki Haley (R) used 13 pens to sign the bill on July 9, nine of which were given to the families of the nine victims who were killed in the mass shooting. [25] [29] After the state House passed the bill, Gov. Haley made the following statement on her Facebook page: “ Today, as the Senate did before them, the House of Representatives has served the State of South Carolina and her people with great dignity. I'm grateful for their service and their compassion. It is a new day in South Carolina, a day we can all be proud of, a day that truly brings us all together as we continue to heal, as one people and one state. [30] ” — Gov. Nikki Haley (R) [31] The flag was removed from the State House grounds in a ceremony on the morning of July 10. [28] After flying for 54 years at the State House, the Confederate flag will now be on exhibit at the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum . [28] Partisan balance 1992-2013 Partisan balance 1992-2013 South Carolina State Senate: From 1992-2013, the Democratic Party was the majority in the South Carolina State Senate for the first nine years while the Republicans were the majority for the last 13 years. South Carolina was under Republican trifectas for the final 11 years of the study. Across the country, there were 541 Democratic and 517 Republican state senates from 1992 to 2013. South Carolina State House of Representatives: From 1992-2013, the Democratic Party was the majority in the South Carolina State House of Representatives for the first three years while the Republicans were the majority for the last 19 years. The South Carolina House of Representatives is one of nine state Houses that was Republican for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. South Carolina was under Republican trifectas for the final 11 years of the study. Across the country, there were 577 Democratic and 483 Republican State Houses of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. Over the course of the 22-year study, state governments became increasingly more partisan. At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states, the most in the 22 years studied. The chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of South Carolina , the South Carolina State Senate and the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. SQLI and partisanship SQLI and partisanship South Carolina was one of eight states to demonstrate a dramatic partisan shift in the 22 years studied. A dramatic shift was defined by a movement of 40 percent or more toward one party over the course of the study period. South Carolina was Republican-dominated during the years of the study but experienced a shift toward much stronger Republican control, resulting in Republican trifectas from 2003-2013. The chart below depicts the partisanship of the South Carolina state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. South Carolina ranked in the bottom-10 during every year of the study except the most recent. In 2012 it improved, finishing at 38th. The state's worst ranking, finishing 47th, occurred during both divided government and Republican trifectas. SQLI average with Democratic trifecta: N/A SQLI average with Republican trifecta: 44.30 SQLI average with divided government: 45.00 Legislators Legislators Salaries Salaries $10,400/year $231/day Salary controversy Salary controversy An October 2010 report by The Nerve showed that S.C. lawmakers receive, on average, about $32,000 per year in combined salary, reimbursements and expenses for serving in the Legislature and performing duties and tasks related to their legislative posts, according to an examination of legislative compensation for a recent two-and-a-half-year period. [33] In all, S.C. taxpayers shelled out at least $14.8 million to cover salaries and expenses for 202 current or former House and Senate members from Jan. 1, 2008, through July 31, 2010, The Nerve reported. [34] That works out to an average of more than $73,000 per legislator for the 2.5-year period. [34] Total salary and expenses for individual lawmakers in The Nerve’s analysis ranged from a high of $133,529 for the 2.5-year period for Senate President Pro Tempore Glenn McConnell , R-Charleston, to a one-year low of $14,287 for former Rep. Bessie Moody-Lawrence, D-York. [34] Salaries for other key S.C. legislators during the 30-month period include: Speaker of the House Bobby Harrell, Jr. , R-Charleston – $128,406; Sen. Thomas Alexander , R-Oconee – $109,505; House Speaker Pro Tempore Harry Cato , R-Greenville – $105,304; and Rep. Bill Sandifer III , R-Oconee – $102,226. [34] The Nerve reported that in terms of lawmakers’ taxable legislative income, legislators most often earn at least $22,400 per year – more than two times their $10,400 salary, and in some cases much higher – when other types of compensation legislators receive are added to their base pay. [33] The Nerve obtained the financial data for the period from January 2008 through mid-2010 using the S.C. Freedom of Information Act. The $32,000 average annual total amount of lawmakers’ salary and expenses didn’t include legislators’ pensions and health care benefits, the investigative website added. [33] While the S.C. General Assembly has not increased legislators’ salaries in 20 years, The Nerve’s investigation revealed an opaque system of legislative compensation that masks the true costs of lawmakers. The fogginess shows up in the other types of remuneration to legislators, the website reported. In dollar amounts from most to least, the three largest supplemental payments to lawmakers are for “in-district expenses,” “subsistence” and mileage. [33] All three categories have caps, sort of: In-district: $1,000 per month, or $12,000 annually. Subsistence: $131 per legislative meeting day, whether in or out of session, for lodging and meals. Mileage: 50 cents per mile for senators; 44.5 cents for House members. Lawmakers also can claim a $35 per-diem for attending a legislative-related meeting on a non-session day, and they are provided allocations for postage and flags, too. The vast majority of South Carolina lawmakers claimed the annual maximum for in-district expenses during the 2.5-year review period. Thus, at $12,000, that alone more than doubled their annual salaries – from $10,400 to $22,400. [33] Reinforcing the point, legislators’ in-district payments are treated as income for tax and pension purposes. For lawmakers who live within 50 miles of the State House, their subsistence also is equated as income under the tax code. The Nerve also reported that S.C. lawmakers are not required to document their actual in-district and subsistence expenses. Mileage is the one category with a built-in accountability feature. But when it comes to in-district and subsistence expenses, legislators file vouchers – not receipts – to claim those payments, filling in the amounts as they wish, up to the caps. [33] When sworn in When sworn in South Carolina legislators assume office the Monday after the election. [35] Joint legislative committees Joint legislative committees The South Carolina State Legislature has one joint standing committee: Interstate Cooperation Committee, South Carolina State Legislature Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the South Carolina Constitution can be amended: The South Carolina Constitution provides two mechanisms for amending the state's constitution— a legislative process and a state constitutional convention. South Carolina requires a simple majority vote (50% plus 1) for voters to approve constitutional amendments. Legislature Legislature A two-thirds (66.67%) vote is required during one legislative session for the South Carolina State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 82 votes in the South Carolina House of Representatives and 30 votes in the South Carolina State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. In South Carolina, the Legislature needs to approve a constitutional amendment for a second time after voters approve the amendment. This second vote requires a simple majority in the House and Senate. Convention Convention According to Section 3 of Article XVI of the South Carolina Constitution , a constitutional convention can be held if two-thirds of the members of both houses of the South Carolina State Legislature vote to put the question on the ballot.
