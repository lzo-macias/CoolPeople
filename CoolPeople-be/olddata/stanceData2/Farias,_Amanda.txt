New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 8 Diana Ayala Mott Haven-Port Morris, Melrose, Concourse-Concourse Village, Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill, Upper East Side-Yorkville, East Harlem (South), East Harlem (North), Randall's Island Biography Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services. Diana was born in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service. As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College. She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff. In her capacity as Deputy Speaker, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, such as: Banning the sale of guinea pigs citywide to encourage more adoptions for our furry friends. Reforming the CityFHEPs program by eliminating the 90-day rule, expanding eligibility to more New Yorkers in need, and removing red tape to expedite the process. Creating a syringe buy-back pilot program to reduce syringe litter within our communities. Requiring the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene to form a committee that would be tasked with creating a community based plan of action to address the opioid epidemic. Diana has used her time in the City Council to uplift the voices of her constituents and address issues ranging from housing, homelessness, mental health, education, substance abuse prevention, and gun violence prevention. Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 14 Pierina Ana Sanchez University Heights (South)-Morris Heights, Mount Hope, Fordham Heights, University Heights (North)-Fordham, Bedford Park, Kingsbridge Heights-Van Cortlandt Village, Kingsbridge-Marble Hill Biography Pierina Sanchez represents the 14th Council District, which includes the resilient neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, Fordham, University Heights and Mount Hope. Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity. Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University. From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors. Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center. Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative. Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community. When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.  Initiatives Parkchester 2024 Community Engagement Bronx Metro North Area Study (BMNS) Engagement Speaker Adams’ Planning Toolkit and Housing Agenda Gowanus Neighborhood Plan: Racial Equity Report on Housing and Opportunity Morningside Heights Planning Study Inwood Rezoning Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan Planning for Retail Diversity East Harlem Rezoning Greater East Midtown Plan History Until 1989, the Council had no authority over land use issues. The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 28 Adrienne E. Adams South Ozone Park, Jamaica, South Jamaica, Baisley Park, Springfield Gardens (North)-Rochdale Village, Springfield Gardens (South)-Brookville Biography Adrienne Eadie Adams is the Speaker of the New York City Council. Elected in January 2022 by her colleagues, she leads the most diverse and the first women-majority Council in New York City history as the first-ever African American Speaker. Elected to the City Council in November 2017, she is also the first woman to represent District 28, which encompasses the Queens neighborhoods of Jamaica, Richmond Hill, Rochdale Village, and South Ozone Park. Under the leadership of Speaker Adams, the Council has been tackling long-standing inequities. She led the lawmaking body to advance women’s health by passing legislative packages to address persistent racial disparities in maternal health and expand access to abortion and reproductive healthcare. The Council, under Speaker Adams’ leadership, also directed the largest amount of municipal funding of any city in the nation to support direct access to abortion healthcare for those without an ability to pay. Speaker Adams has expanded support for crime victims in communities that experience high levels of violence but are underserved by traditional victim services. She created a new $5.1 million budget initiative to fund community safety and victim services at the neighborhood level, and secured funding to establish New York State’s first four Trauma Recovery Centers. Speaker Adams and the Council prioritized addressing inequities in the city’s workforce, passing legislative packages to confront the historic lack of diversity in the FDNY and gender- and race-based pay disparities that impact municipal workers. Speaker Adams also helped establish the CUNY Reconnect program that has helped thousands of working-age New Yorkers to return to college in pursuit of a degree after leaving school. Speaker Adams’ leadership has set a new tone for the Council’s leadership in addressing the City’s housing crisis. Under her leadership, the Council approved over 40 land use projects in 2022, which will produce more than 12,000 units of housing, over 63% of which are affordable. Adams also put forward an aggressive Housing Agenda with a Fair Housing Framework to increase the equitable production of affordable housing development across the City, while prioritizing deeper affordability, housing preservation, and homeownership. During her first term in the Council, Speaker Adams secured a record level of funding for her district, which had endured years of disparity and disinvestment, including investments in schools, parks, libraries, housing, and sanitation services. As a member of the Budget Negotiating Team, she championed funding for cultural institutions, health care, digital access, child and adult literacy, community-based food pantries, small business assistance, as well as Fair Futures, an initiative providing mentorship and services for foster care youth. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she fought to secure additional testing and vaccine sites in her district, which lacked equitable resources despite having one of the highest COVID-19 case rates in the entire City. While serving as Co-Chair of the Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus (BLAC) of the Council, Speaker Adams advocated for additional investments in foreclosure prevention programs, CUNY’s research institutions, and many other community support initiatives. Under her leadership, the City Council also funded the Education Equity Action Plan, an initiative to implement a comprehensive K-12 Black Studies Curriculum for all students in New York City’s public schools. As Chair of the Committee on Public Safety, Speaker Adams shepherded passage of critical reform legislation to improve police accountability and transparency. These included bills to end qualified immunity (making New York City the first city in the nation to enact such a law); require NYPD to document and report on vehicle stops with demographic breakdowns (race, gender, etc.); and empower the Civilian Complaint Review Board to initiate investigations into police misconduct. During her tenure as Chair of the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions, she played a key role in advancing the plan to close Rikers Island. Speaker Adams also passed legislation to reform the City’s tax lien sale to protect homeowners, extend protections for fast food workers, require transparency on the Administration for Children’s Services’ emergency removals of children, and return unused commissary funds to formerly incarcerated New Yorkers. Speaker Adams was raised in Hollis, Queens, as the daughter of two proud union workers. She attended St. Pascal Baylon Elementary School and Bayside High School. After briefly studying at CUNY’s York College, she earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, minoring in Early Childhood Development. Prior to serving in the City Council, Speaker Adams worked professionally as a Corporate Trainer at several Fortune 500 companies, specializing in Executive Training, Telecommunications Management, and Human Capital Management, and worked as a Childhood Development Associate Instructor, training child care professionals to obtain their Child Development Associate credentials in accordance with the standards set by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. Speaker Adams first entered public service as a member of Queens Community Board 12, the second largest community board in the borough. She was appointed Chair of the Education Committee, advocating for education equity and opposing school closures and co-locations. In recognition of her leadership, Speaker Adams was elected to three consecutive terms as Chair of Community Board 12, serving from December 2012 to November 2017. She advocated for improved delivery of services, economic opportunities, and better quality of life in Southeast Queens. As a community advocate, Speaker Adams served in leadership positions for community-based organizations and advisory committees. She was appointed by then Queens Borough President Melinda Katz to the Queens Public Library Board of Trustees, overseeing a 62-branch institution that maintained the highest circulation of any municipal library system in the country. Additionally, she was appointed to the Local Planning Committee for the Jamaica Downtown Revitalization Initiative and served as Co-Chair of the Jamaica NOW Leadership Council. In these roles, Speaker Adams guided more than $150 million in funding and investments for workforce and business development, education, health and wellness, housing, and transportation for the Downtown Jamaica area. Speaker Adams is an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, the first sorority for Black college-educated women. She is also a longstanding member of the NAACP and the National Action Network. Speaker Adams is a wife, mother, and grandmother (“cool Nona”) within her beloved blended family.

Brooks-Powers Arverne, Brookville, Edgemere, Jamaica (parts), Far Rockaway, Laurelton, Rosedale, Springfield Gardens (parts) Biography Selvena N. Brooks-Powers represents the 31st City Council District, which includes the communities of Arverne, Brookville, Edgemere, Laurelton, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, and Far Rockaway. She is the first-ever Black woman to serve as Majority Whip of the City Council as well as Chair of its Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Selvena has devoted her time at the Council to ensuring Southeast Queens and the eastern end of the Rockaway Peninsula have equitable access to city resources. She has directed tens of millions of capital and discretionary toward infrastructure and community-based programs in her district, including for schools, parks, firehouses, and so much more. She continues to fight for resources for a community that has been too long underserved by the city. She worked, for example, to secure $95 million in restoration funding for the 116th Precinct, and continues to advocate for the construction of certified trauma center on the Rockaway Peninsula. A dedicated public servant for 20 years and lifelong resident of Southeast Queens, Selvena Brooks-Powers is the proud daughter of immigrant parents and devoted to fighting for what’s right and delivering results. As a community organizer, Selvena drove high-impact initiatives on critical issues, including education, voting rights and empowerment, racial and economic justice, relief efforts post-Hurricane Katrina, M/WBE opportunities, and workers’ rights. Immediately prior to elected office, Selvena was a manager for M/WBE compliance, external affairs and community outreach on the $13 billion JFK International Airport Redevelopment Program. Previously, Selvena worked for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) family as a communications director for various campaigns, including the Fight for $15 campaign across numerous states, and on one of the tightest Congressional races to win back the majority in the U.S. Congress. Selvena also helped mobilize and ultimately unionized co-workers under the United Media Guild of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), where she was unanimously elected delegate for the northeast region. Selvena’s prior experiences in government range from the New York State Senate Majority Conference Leader to the New York City Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence to even  the first New York City Public Advocate’s Office, where she volunteered as a teen. Selvena has always been committed to service throughout Queens. She served as an advisor to the NAACP Jamaica Youth Branch, chair to a number of committees within the Queens Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and Board Member to the Ocean Breeze Condominiums and Martin de Porres Youth and Family. A proud HBCU alumna, Selvena is a graduate of Wilberforce University, the first privately owned and operated HBCU. She also holds a M.S. in International Law from New York University.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 47 Justin Brannan Bay Ridge, Coney Island, Sea Gate and parts of Dyker Heights, Bath Beach and Gravesend Biography Councilman Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the proud son of a teacher and a record salesman. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism in college before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – performing in over fifty countries across five continents. Later, while working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as chief of staff to his predecessor Councilman Vinnie Gentile before being tapped by Mayor de Blasio to help oversee the expansion of his historic universal pre-K initiative as director of intergovernmental affairs at the NYC Department of Education. A believer in the importance of making government work efficiently and making life easier for working and middle class families, Brannan was first elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn. With too many people feeling that the government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Brannan vowed to always fight for the “little guy.” Today, when he isn’t personally making sure your garbage gets picked up or rescuing a wayward kitten in a tree, Brannan serves as Chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance where he oversees the largest municipal budget in the country. Whether pushing to expand the New York City Human Rights Law to empower survivors of domestic violence or delivering the first New York City property tax rebate in 15 years, Brannan has never backed down from a fight. As the lucky recipient of a cornea transplant, Brannan has pushed for free vision care & eyeglasses for the poor. Often acknowledging that the three chords he learned at McKinley afforded him a career as a world-touring musician, Brannan has been a champion for increased arts & music funding in our public schools. Since first being elected, Brannan has brought back over $100 million to southwest Brooklyn through investments in parks, playgrounds, libraries and five new public schools. Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his amazing wife Leigh, an artist, educator & small business owner. They share their home with two retired racing greyhounds: Luna and Fiorello.

She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours and summers at the local Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. She is a graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Government and Politics, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. She presently serves as the Majority Leader of the City Council and is in her second term as the Council Member for the 18th District, representing the neighborhoods of Castle Hill, Clason Point, Harding Park, Parkchester, Unionport, Soundview, and Westchester Square. She was first elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021, won her re-election in November 2023, and was appointed as Majority Leader in January 2024. Her appointment as Majority Leader by Speaker Adrienne E. Adams was a historic moment that signified the next generation of leadership in New York. Farías is the first Latina to serve in this role and marks the first time the top leadership positions of the New York City Council will all be held by women, all of whom are women of color. As Majority Leader she remains focused on the issues of the collective democratic ideals of the Council and working class communities like her own in Council District 18 and across New York City. Council Member Farías serves as the Chair of the Committee on Economic Development. She is historically the first woman, Bronxite, and Latinx person to serve as Chair of the Committee. As Chair, she has passed important legislation to create a citywide plan for industrial development , provide discounted ferry fares for high school students , codify the NYC ferry discount program , and more. She hosted the City’s first legislative hearings on the adult-use cannabis industry, public heliports, and the procurement of small businesses in migrant shelter food contracts.

Since Farías was first elected to the City Council in 2021, she has served in multiple leadership roles as the Chair of the Committee on Economic Development, a dedicated member of the Budget Negotiation Team, and Co-Chair of the largest Women’s Caucus in the history of the City Council.

While she is no longer Co-Chair, she will continue to serve on the Commission on Gender Equity and work to create holistic improvements to the quality of life for women, trans women, and gender non-conforming people across New York City. During the height of the pandemic Farías became active in mutual aid and as Council Member she has continued to keep the fight against f ood insecurity as a top priority in her office . Farías has continuously supported local pantries, community gardens, hosts several food distributions a year, and more through her office budget. She also spearheaded an initiative to distribute $25,000 in Health Bucks at the local farmers market for people to buy fresh produce. Through this initiative her office personally helped over 1,000 people put healthy food on the table for their families for free. Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including as Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus, a district wide Participatory Budgeting process and councilmanic budget and legislative priorities. After her time in the Council, Farías joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017 to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx.

During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Farías created a pipeline for more women, immigrants, and people of color to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged.

Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City.  Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged.

She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours and summers at the local Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. She is a graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Government and Politics, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. She presently serves as the Majority Leader of the City Council and is in her second term as the Council Member for the 18th District, representing the neighborhoods of Castle Hill, Clason Point, Harding Park, Parkchester, Unionport, Soundview, and Westchester Square. She was first elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021, won her re-election in November 2023, and was appointed as Majority Leader in January 2024. Her appointment as Majority Leader by Speaker Adrienne E. Adams was a historic moment that signified the next generation of leadership in New York. Farías is the first Latina to serve in this role and marks the first time the top leadership positions of the New York City Council will all be held by women, all of whom are women of color. As Majority Leader she remains focused on the issues of the collective democratic ideals of the Council and working class communities like her own in Council District 18 and across New York City.

She hosted the City’s first legislative hearings on the adult-use cannabis industry, public heliports, and the procurement of small businesses in migrant shelter food contracts.

This proposal doesn’t just reject harmful cuts — it charts a path forward with smart, targeted investments that uplift working families and strengthen our workforce. Whether it’s funding a concussion clinic for survivors of domestic violence, supporting our industrial sectors, or reinvesting in the city’s tourism industry, we’re putting people first and investing in a stronger, more inclusive New York City.” Among Majority Leader Farías’ key wins in this year’s response: Investment in Women’s Health: Concussion Clinic Pilot The budget response includes funding for a pilot program for a women’s concussion clinic , an initiative championed by Majority Leader Farías to address a longstanding gap in gender-specific research, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions. This clinic would provide tailored, trauma-informed care and serve as a vital step toward equity in women’s healthcare. The pilot program directly aligns with Intro 0029-2024 , legislation the Majority Leader is advancing in the Council. “We are immensely grateful to Majority Leader Farías for her leadership advocating for improved treatment and support for domestic violence survivors with possible traumatic brain injury,” said Noelle Withers, EVP & Chief Program Officer at Volunteers of America-Greater New York. “Our organization has been championing this long-overlooked issue since 2022. Dedicated concussion clinics for women will be instrumental in raising awareness of the epidemic of traumatic brain injury among domestic violence survivors and will strengthen our ability to treat these injuries. We strongly urge Mayor Adams to approve this funding in his final budget.” “For too long, the public discourse around traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been focused on athletes, leaving a significant gap in screening, treatment, and support for the silent majority – domestic violence survivors – who have sustained TBIs through injuries to the head or neck,” said Dr. Edie Zusman, board-certified neurosurgeon and President and CEO of Safe Living Space. “New York is leading the nation in addressing this gap through public awareness, data collection, and now direct health care interventions. I am grateful to Majority Leader Amanda Farias for championing this issue over the past three years and devising a model for other public officials across the nation to emulate.” Doubling Investment in Industrial Business Support The Council calls for doubling funding for Industrial Business Service Providers (IBSPs) from $1.3 million to $2.6 million, a priority the Majority Leader has been advocating for since the passage of Intro 1012-2023 , the Industrial Development Strategic Plan. IBSPs offer specialized support to businesses in critical sectors such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, wholesale utilities, and film production. This investment will help stabilize and grow New York City’s industrial economy while providing job pathways for working-class New Yorkers. “Industrial jobs are a cornerstone of an equitable economy—offering good wages, real career pathways, and opportunities for working-class New Yorkers, particularly communities of color and immigrant workers,” said Cassandra Williams of the Greenpoint Design & Manufacturing Center and a member of the Industrial Jobs Coalition (IJC). “The IJC applauds the steadfast leadership of Speaker Adams, Majority Leader Amanda Farías, and the Council’s M Zone Coalition, whose vision for protecting and strengthening New York City’s industrial sector has been instrumental in advancing a more inclusive local economy. We urge the full Council to build on this leadership by voting to increase funding for the City’s Industrial Business Service Providers (IBSPs) — who deliver critical, wraparound support to new and existing industrial businesses. This is how we grow a thriving industrial sector that works for all New Yorkers.” Reversal of Cuts to NYC Tourism & Conventions The response also recommends restoring $7 million to New York City Tourism & Conventions (NYCTC) , reversing a proposed Program to Eliminate the Gap (PEG) cut. With current funding at $18.6 million, this investment reflects the critical role tourism plays in driving economic activity, supporting local jobs, and keeping New York City a top global destination. These budget priorities reflect Majority Leader Farías’ continued commitment to equity, workforce development, and public health. As the budget process continues, she remains dedicated to fighting for a final budget that delivers tangible results for everyday New Yorkers. “Tourism is a cornerstone of New York City’s economy, supporting more than 380,00 jobs for New Yorkers, and driving billions in economic impact in every corner of the five boroughs,” said NYC Tourism + Conventions President and CEO Julie Coker.  “Restoring these critical funds ensures that our city remains a top global destination, welcoming visitors from around the world and sustaining the businesses that make NYC vibrant. We applaud Majority Leader Farías and Finance Committee Chair Brannan for their leadership in championing this investment, which will keep our tourism sector strong and thriving.” Media Contact : Nathalie Levey, Communications Director | nlevey@council.nyc.gov | (332) 227-2157 Posted in Budget Majority Leader Amanda Farías Secures Key Wins in the Council’s FY26 Preliminary Budget Response April 3, 2025 New York, NY – New York City Council Majority Leader Amanda Farías proudly announced critical victories in the City Council’s Fiscal Year 2026 Preliminary Budget Response, securing targeted investments that uplift women’s health, strengthen New York City’s industrial workforce, and restore vital funding to the tourism sector. “As Majority Leader and Chair of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee, I’m proud to deliver a Preliminary Budget Response that reflects the Council’s deep commitment to equity, care, and economic opportunity.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home.

Last name: Ayala E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence. She is a partner with the people, and a strong voice and aggressive champion for what she believes in.  Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

Eric is a community activist, former special education teacher and Chapter Leader for the United Federation of Teachers and former Aging Chair of Bronx Community Board 8.  Eric attended Bronx’s public schools, and has a personal investment in the success of our students. As a special education teacher for thirteen years in our community, he taught and counseled the students who needed the most support. Council Member Dinowitz made sure each of them had a fair shot to succeed and gave them the tools they needed to do it.  As a Democratic District Leader, Council Member Dinowitz worked to make voting easier and more accessible.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.

His district includes the South Shore of Staten Island. Joe serves as the Minority Whip, and is the current Chairperson for the Committee on Fire and Emergency Management at the New York City Council. Joe also currently serves as a member of the Committee on Education, Committee on Parks and Recreation, and the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Libraries and International Intergroup Relations.  Joe previously represented his South Shore constituents in the New York State Assembly. He was the ranking minority member of the Assembly Cities Committee, and he also served on committees for Health, Housing, Transportation, Mental Health, Banking, Education, and Energy. Joe was a staunch advocate against energy cost increases, and the common core curriculum.  Prior to his career as an elected official, Joe served as Chief of Staff to former Councilman Vincent Ignizio since 2007, formerly serving in the same role for Ignizio in the state Assembly since 2005. Dedicated to improving the quality of life on Staten Island, Joe was successful in coordinating the development of several Park and Rides here on Staten Island, securing funds to outfit nearly every classroom on the South Shore with a Smartboard and has worked with the Parks Department on the renovation and construction of several parks on Staten Island. Joe grew upon Staten Island where he attended Public School 4, Our Lady Star of the Sea Grammar School, and St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School from which he graduated in 2000. Joe would go on to Marist College where he graduated with a B.A. in Political Science, and an M.A. from the College of Staten Island, a subject that he has been teaching locally as an Adjunct Professor at the College of Staten Island since 2008.  Active in his community, Joe has been involved in the Staten Island Growth Management Task Force, the West Shore Light Rail Task Force, the Brookfield Landfill Citizens Advisory Committee, and helped spearhead the formation of the South Shore Business Improvement District. He was also instrumental in the successful fight to eradicate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from public school buildings. Throughout his career in state and city government, Joe has proven himself to be a leader in the movement to reduce taxes, tolls, and fees in New York City.  As a volunteer, Joe serves on the Development Board of St. Joseph by the Sea High School, as well as the Friends of the College of Staten Island, which raise money for scholarships. He has assisted dozens of non-profit, veterans and community organizations in accessing governmental grants. He has helped raise private money for equipment to help handicapped children at Mount Loretto, and has worked with the Verdino Foundation to bring the new state-of-the-art little league facility to the South Shore.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

District 2 - Council Member - Democrat - East Village, Gramercy Park, Kips Bay, Lower East Side, Murray Hill, Rose Hill - Carlina Rivera represents the 2nd Council District which includes the diverse neighborhoods of the East Village, Flatiron, Gramercy Park, Rose Hill, Kips Bay, Murray Hill, and the Lower East Side. Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

As the daughter of Puerto Rican parents who moved here in the 1970’s to build a better life, she learned the values of hard work, dedication and commitment to education at a young age. Marjorie’s roots in the community were formed during her early years attending Public schools in Parkchester and St. Catharine’s Academy for high school in Pelham Parkway before earning her degree in Finance and Accounting at NYU. She worked in several corporate finance, budgeting, and accounting positions, where she designed and implemented accounting strategies for various regions around the world.  In 2012, Marjorie suffered life-changing injuries from a workplace accident and a subsequent serious car crash that left her temporarily disabled. Always a fighter, she found a path to recovery through giving back to her community. During her recovery, Marjorie’s life went from one of painful struggle to one of public service. Marjorie volunteered her time to elect several elected officials through historic and decisive wins. She also joined Bronx Community Board 10 where she served as treasurer and Municipal Services Committee chair, which focused on providing a much-needed voice to the community on issues ranging from transportation to parks services and other quality of life issues.  On the Community Board, she fought for budget equity for the community, open public spaces, and responsible business practices and against overdevelopment. Marjorie has also focused her time on the community board to help empower and promote advocacy on important issues of racial and gender equality, public safety and funding communities.  Marjorie also served as a volunteer on the boards of Amplify Her and the Broad Room, both of which are dedicated to empowering women through civil and political engagement. She also served on the board of St. Joseph’s School for the Deaf Children’s Fund, the Bronx- Westchester advisory board of Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and the Bronx River Alliance that advocates for environmental justice and resiliency.  Marjorie lives in Throggs Neck with her husband, Jeff, and their three rescue cats, Mercutio, Mio, and Savannah Grace.

Prior to becoming a City Councilmember, Oswald worked as a tenant lawyer, and successfully defended Bronx residents in eviction and landlord harassment cases. Oswald represented a tenant association in a building-wide case against a landlord who failed to keep their building in good condition, and negotiated a settlement wherein tenants received approximately $100,000 from their landlord due to the conditions. Prior to becoming a Councilmember, Oswald also served as an adjunct professor at Hostos Community College, where he had the privilege of teaching reading and writing to disadvantaged students in the Bronx.  Oswald is a proud graduate of public schools in the Bronx, including P.S.46, M.S.45, Walton High School, Bronx Community College, and Lehman College.

Last name: Gennaro E-mail: gennaro@council.nyc.gov Web site: http://council.nyc.gov/d24/html/members/home.shtml Notes: District 24 - Council Member - Democrat  - Kew Gardens Hills, Pomonok, Electchester, Fresh Meadows, Hillcrest, Jamaica Estates, Briarwood, Parkway Village, Jamaica Hills, Jamaica - James “Jim” F. Gennaro is a Democratic member of the New York City Council, where he represents the 24th Council District and chairs the Council’s Committee on Environmental Protection, Resiliency & Waterfronts. Gennaro served his first terms from 2002 to 2013.  Although most closely associated with nationally-acclaimed environmental lawmaking, Gennaro authored more than 50 laws covering many issues, including increasing protections for women against domestic violence, protecting consumers from unscrupulous bankruptcy counselors, and in 2013, he authored and passed a law that raises the age of sale of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21, known as the “Tobacco 21” law, the first-in-the-nation law of its kind. In 2020, Tobacco 21 was adopted as national policy. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine states that the Tobacco 21 movement has saved “countless lives” across the United States.  Since his return to the City Council in 2021, Gennaro has continued to be the guiding hand of environmental policy in New York City. The main focus of his work has been on holding the city accountable to its stated emissions goals and pushing for greater storm resiliency in the face of more frequent superstorms. He has also been one of the strongest voices on the council calling on the state to institute a dangerousness standard for the courts in order to stem the rising tide of crimes the city is facing.

Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.  Shahana attended PS 230 in Kensington and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies at Brooklyn College. She lives in Kensington with her cat, Babe.

Last name: Carr E-mail: District50@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/david-carr/ Notes: District 50 - Council Member - Republican - Blank Arrochar, Bloomfield, Bulls Head, Castleton Corners, Chelsea, Concord, Dongan Hills, Egbertville, Emerson Hill, Fort Wadsworth, Graniteville, Grant City, Grasmere, Heartland Village, Isle of Meadows, Lighthouse Hill, Manor Heights, Meiers Corners, Midland Beach, New Dorp, New Springville, Oakwood, Ocean Breeze, Old Town, Prall's Island, Richmondtown, Rosebank, Shore Acres, South Beach, Todt Hill, Travis, Westerleigh, and Willowbrook - David Carr is the Council Member representing the Mid-Island based 50th Councilmanic District. Prior to his election to the Council in November 2021, Carr served as Chief of Staff to Minority Leader Matteo for the previous eight years. As a focal point of the Mid-Island Council office, Carr managed a broad range of issues from constituent and community matters, to moving legislation in City Hall. In less than seven years, he helped negotiate the passage of 27 of Matteo’s bills, which is a record for a Staten Island Council Member. He also worked closely with many community organizations and city agencies to help the Council member allocate funding and capital resources.  Carr has had a lifelong passion for government and politics and began getting involved in campaigns at the age of 10, stuffing mailings and doing literature drops for Guy Molinari’s final run for Borough President. He continued to be involved in races over the years and decided to dedicate his professional life to bettering his community through political action. After being staff on campaigns for two years, Carr began working in government doing constituent services in the United States House of Representatives. He eventually became the Chief of Staff to then-newly elected state Assemblyman, and current City Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli before taking that role for Matteo in 2014.  Carr has also been an active member of the Staten Island Republican Party’s County Committee (SIGOP) since 2009 and its Executive Committee since 2012. He is a former President of the Richmond County Young Republicans and First Vice-Chair of the SIGOP.  A lifelong resident of Grasmere, Carr attended St. Christopher’s Preschool, P.S. 48 in Concord, and the former St. John Villa Academy for elementary and middle school and Monsignor Farrell High School. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Government from Georgetown University.

Last name: Riley E-mail: District12@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-12/ Notes: District 12 - Council Member - Democrat  - Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Co-op City - New York City - Kevin Christopher Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York.  While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal.  Prior to being elected to represent the New York City Council’s 12th district, Kevin worked for the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Carl E. Heastie.  For over a decade, he worked directly with community groups and organizations as well as pertinent leaders across New York City. This is where his passion was born, this is where he gained the courage to run for City Council.  Kevin has been no stranger to hard work or mentorship. Not only has he had mentors throughout his career, he has also dedicated his down time to generating positive relationships with the youth. Working for the New York Foundling as a Skills Coach is where he witnessed how much mentorship can impact your growth and overall confidence. As a skills coach, he mentored young men, educating them on life skills and making them cognizant of their social surroundings. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s, My Brother’s Keeper initiative.  In 2019, he founded a non-profit organization, Music Over Violence, which seeks to address violence and social injustice within his community. Another endeavor undertaken by Kevin, in conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers, is the founding of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives.  As the father of two beautiful daughters, Kevin C. Riley is a leader who is committed to making his community better for future generations. Councilman Riley currently represents the 12th City Council District covering the areas of Wakefield, Baychester, Eastchester, Olinville, Co-op City, Edenwald, and Williamsbridge in the Northeast section of the Bronx.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.

She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Amanda is a lifelong Bronxite, born and raised in Soundview as a second-generation Afro-Latina of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent. She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours learning to dance and summers at camp in Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. Soon after graduate school, she started her career by fighting voter suppression and mobilizing Black and Latino communities for President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus and a districtwide Participatory Budgeting process. After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx. Amanda’s programming and partnerships with CUNY, labor unions, and local community-based organizations have allowed her to create new opportunities for young Bronxites to access trade jobs. During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Amanda created a pipeline for more women to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.  During the height of the pandemic Amanda became active in mutual aid and feels most in her element when in community. Hosting food distributions for neighbors has been at the core of her service to continue the fight against food insecurity and The Bronx being the unhealthiest county in NYS.  She was elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021. Amanda currently resides in Parkchester with her dog and cat.

Last name: Brannan E-mail: AskJB@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/justin-brannan/ Notes: District 47 - Council Member - Democrat - Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach - Council Member Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a record salesman and early childhood educator. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism at Fordham, before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – traveling to over fifty countries across five continents.  While working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor Council Member Gentile and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Education where he helped oversee the expansion of Universal Pre-K.  A longtime believer in the importance of making government work efficiently to create opportunities for working and middle class families, Brannan was elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn’s 43rd Council District. With too many people feeling that government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Council Member Brannan has vowed to always fight for the “little guy.”  The 43rd Council District might be far from the soaring skyscrapers and posh penthouses that many associate with New York City, but Brannan knows that his district is the backbone of the City and deserves the same respect, resources and results as everyone else. As Council Member, he’s made it his mission to make life just a little bit easier for everyone who calls the 43rd District their home.  Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his wife Leigh, an artist, educator, and small business owner.

Last name: Holden E-mail: District30@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/robert-holden/ Notes: District  30 - Council Member - Democrat - Glendale, Maspeth, Middle Village, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, Woodside - Robert F. Holden was born in 1951 and raised in Maspeth. He and his wife of 45 years, Amy, have lived in Middle Village for decades and have three children and four grand children. Holden worked as a graphic designer and served as a professor at New York City College of Technology (CUNY) in the Department of Communication Design. For 25 years, he held the office of president of the Juniper Park Civic Association, which represents the neighborhoods of Middle Village and Maspeth. During that time he also served as Managing Editor and Art Director of the Juniper Berry Magazine, the JPCA’s 96-page color magazine. First published in 1940, the Juniper Berry is considered one of the finest all-volunteer civic magazines in the nation. Holden also served as webmaster of the JPCA’s informative website, www.junipercivic.com.  Robert Holden has received several achievement awards from the United States Congress, New York State Senate and the New York City Council. In 2012 he was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Queens Civic Congress for his volunteer work in the community. Prof. Holden also received the PSC-CUNY Excellence in Teaching Award in 1999.  The Juniper Park Civic Association, founded in 1938 and chartered in 1940, has grown to 1,750 member families and is considered one of the most active civic associations in the State of New York. Some of the JPCA’s accomplishments include: fighting to save the former Elmhurst Gas Tanks 6.5 acre site from becoming a big box store – it is now a park – and saving St. Saviour’s, a 1847 carpenter gothic-style church designed by world renowned architect, Richard Upjohn. The JPCA successfully fought against the Cross Harbor Tunnel that included a large train-truck intermodal in Maspeth and led an overdevelopment task force that downzoned all of Maspeth and Middle Village.  Mr. Holden is also founder and president of the Juniper Valley Park Conservancy Inc., an organization that raises funds and organizes volunteers to care for the park. The group has co-sponsored summer concerts in Juniper Valley Park for the past 18 years. Robert Holden also founded the Midville Dodgers youth baseball teams for ages 10 -18, serving as president for 20 years. The Midville Dodgers won the NABF national championship in 2006 and are consistently one of the most successful baseball organizations in New York State.  In 1991 Mr. Holden co-founded COP104, a coalition of civic groups within the Community Board 5 area that sponsored monthly police and community forums for more than 20 years.  Robert Holden was a member of Community Board 5 Queens for 30 years, served as First Chair for seven years, and has been chairman of the board’s Public Safety Committee for 13 years.

Supporting local schools and education, Inna has volunteered her time participating in “Career Day” for public school students, advising and inspiring classes of middle schoolers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Inna volunteered her time at the local Masbia Soup Kitchen and donated meals to law enforcement officers at the New York City Police Department’s 61st precinct in Brooklyn, as well as essential workers at Staten Island University Hospital.  Faced with the persistent failure of government on local issues and local communities, Inna began getting involved in politics and government. Inna joined the campaign of former Senator David Storobin, was Special Assistant to former Assemblyman Dov Hikind, and spent her time registering voters on the street with the United Jewish Voters Alliance, while simultaneously running her business.  Inna currently helps mobilize assistance to those in need throughout the 48th City Council District, and has received recognition for the results of her work. She is a board member and Women’s Committee Chair for Americans Against Antisemitism and a Chair at Legion Self Defense, an organization providing self-defense and active shooter training. Inna has been nominated for the Jewish Week’s “36 under 36” award, and has received a Congressional acknowledgement for Business Development and Excellent Legal Services, a New York State Senate Certificate of Merit for providing outstanding services to the community, an Attorney of the Year Award in Sheepshead Bay, a City Council acknowledgement sponsored by Councilman Chaim M. Deutsch, and a Congressional Recognition for Outstanding and Invaluable Service to The Community. Inna was published in the Algemeiner, The Forward, and InTouch.

Shekar co-founded Communities Resist, a legal services organization highly acclaimed citywide for its community-rooted, intersectional approach to housing and racial justice in North Brooklyn and Queens. He represented tenants and neighborhood coalitions in fair housing litigation and anti-displacement advocacy in some of the most gentrified neighborhoods in NYC. Shekar began his legal career with the landmark Broadway Triangle fair housing struggle against the City of New York, a successful case challenging a rezoning under the Fair Housing Act. He also co-founded Friends of Diversity Plaza. Located on the border of Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, Diversity Plaza has become a national symbol of how public space can bring people together.  Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two small children, who can often be seen biking or scooting up and down the open 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

For more than a decade, she has worked for the well-being of working families, women, seniors, and the youth of New York City Council District 41. Her passion for the people of her district is displayed through her focus on legislation that reflects core community values which include: equality, fairness and non-discrimination in the workplace.  Local Law 33 of 2015, authored by Council Member Mealy, entrusted the NYC Commission on Human Rights with pursuing employment discrimination investigations. This law ensured that constituents seeking jobs across the city truly have a fair shot during the job application process. In conjunction with Local Law 33, Mealy also authored Local Law 29 of 2015, which ensures that the Commission on Human Rights regularly reports its work combating unlawful discriminatory practices.  As the former Chair of the Committee on Contracts, Mealy used her power over the City’s annual multi-billion dollar contracting budget to lift up Minority and Women-owned Businesses (MWBEs). She contributed to the passing of Local Law 1 of 2013, a pivotal MWBE legislation that helped underpin the MWBE program that the city still offers today. Her leadership has been prominent in later New York State and City Council legislation that adjusted procurement rules to allow for MWBEs to have real pathways to secure government contracts. Focusing on the challenges MWBEs has face ensures that small businesses across New York City, and in District 41, realize opportunities to secure the stability and growth that a city contract secures.  Using her expertise in navigating the city’s departments, Council Member Mealy secured a roster of results for her community. From Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of Buildings to the Department for the Aging and the Department of Youth and Community Development, Mealy has worked directly with the alphabet soup of City agencies that make decisions that impact daily lives of local constituents. The number of community resources that include the placements of senior programs, community workshops, funding for community-based organizations have all benefitted from her guidance and experience.  Council Member Mealy is truly BACK and BETTER THAN EVER.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

Susan is also an active member of Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association and has dedicated herself to voter education efforts, youth leadership development, and civic engagement activities.  As a first-generation immigrant, an Asian-American, a working wife, a mother of two young children, and a proud New Yorker, Susan is committed to continuing her journey of working side-by-side with her neighbors to solve their problems and create positive change in this post-pandemic era.

Last name: Moya E-mail: Fmoya@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-21/ Notes: District  21 - Council Member - Democrat - East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona in Queens, including Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Lefrak City and LaGuardia Airport - Francisco Moya currently represents the 21st Council District- encompassing East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and his native Corona.  Prior to his 2017 election to the Council, Moya was elected to the 39th Assembly District in 2010, making him the first Ecuadorian-American elected to public office in the United States.  A lifelong resident of Corona, Queens, Francisco began organizing in his community at the age of 15, when he and a group of concerned neighbors started the Corona Gardens Neighborhood Association, organizing members of the community and working to improve quality of life. Francisco went on to graduate from St. John’s University. He graduated with an MPA from Baruch College’s Urban Fellow program. Subsequently worked for two members of Congress, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Brad Sherman, in Washington, D.C.  In 2003, Francisco was named Secretary to the Senate for Senate Minority Leader David A. Paterson, and became the highest-ranking Latino in state government.  Throughout his years in the Assembly, Francisco has been a champion for working-class families, fighting to pass legislation that would preserve union rights, improve workplace safety and strengthen worker protections. He successfully passed legislation to stop employment agencies from robbing low-income families of hundreds in unfulfilled finder’s fees.  Francisco shined a spotlight on the epidemic of construction deaths that claimed as many as 33 lives — typically low-income workers of color — in just two years. He wrote Carlos’ Law and repeatedly blocked efforts to repeal the Scaffold Law in efforts to provide workers with the basic protections they need and deserve.  Council Member Moya continues to be a leader in the fight against hate-crimes and anti-immigrant policies on the national stage, introducing an omnibus bill – the New York State Liberty Act – to establish protections for undocumented immigrants that have long contributed to the culture and economy of New York and his district. As a leader in the fight to expand college opportunities for the children of undocumented immigrants, he wrote the DREAM Act, which was signed into law in 2019.  He also passed “curbstoning” legislation that allows the NYPD to tow for-sale cars that take up public street parking and are often uninspected and unsafe and as Chair of the Commission on Science and Technology, he worked to foster public-private relationships to bring STEM curriculum into the classroom and train students with skills that will prepare them for the industries of tomorrow.   As a community organizer, Assemblyman and now a City Council Member, Moya has been a stalwart champion for working-class and immigrant families and continuously fought to improve the quality of life for his community.

Throughout his years in the Assembly, Francisco has been a champion for working-class families, fighting to pass legislation that would preserve union rights, improve workplace safety and strengthen worker protections. He successfully passed legislation to stop employment agencies from robbing low-income families of hundreds in unfulfilled finder’s fees.  Francisco shined a spotlight on the epidemic of construction deaths that claimed as many as 33 lives — typically low-income workers of color — in just two years. He wrote Carlos’ Law and repeatedly blocked efforts to repeal the Scaffold Law in efforts to provide workers with the basic protections they need and deserve.  Council Member Moya continues to be a leader in the fight against hate-crimes and anti-immigrant policies on the national stage, introducing an omnibus bill – the New York State Liberty Act – to establish protections for undocumented immigrants that have long contributed to the culture and economy of New York and his district. As a leader in the fight to expand college opportunities for the children of undocumented immigrants, he wrote the DREAM Act, which was signed into law in 2019.  He also passed “curbstoning” legislation that allows the NYPD to tow for-sale cars that take up public street parking and are often uninspected and unsafe and as Chair of the Commission on Science and Technology, he worked to foster public-private relationships to bring STEM curriculum into the classroom and train students with skills that will prepare them for the industries of tomorrow.   As a community organizer, Assemblyman and now a City Council Member, Moya has been a stalwart champion for working-class and immigrant families and continuously fought to improve the quality of life for his community. District  21 - Council Member - Democrat - East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona in Queens, including Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Lefrak City and LaGuardia Airport - Francisco Moya currently represents the 21st Council District- encompassing East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and his native Corona.  Prior to his 2017 election to the Council, Moya was elected to the 39th Assembly District in 2010, making him the first Ecuadorian-American elected to public office in the United States.  A lifelong resident of Corona, Queens, Francisco began organizing in his community at the age of 15, when he and a group of concerned neighbors started the Corona Gardens Neighborhood Association, organizing members of the community and working to improve quality of life. Francisco went on to graduate from St. John’s University. He graduated with an MPA from Baruch College’s Urban Fellow program.

She has served as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs and Commissioner of Media and Entertainment. She previously served as a Columbia adjunct professor teaching on city and state government, preemption and home rule.  The daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Julie is a third-generation New Yorker who lives in Yorkville with her husband and her children.  As the 2020 New York City Census Director, Julie led a historically successful effort as New York City gained more population than any city in America. Her leadership was responsible for ensuring that New York City receives its fair share of over $1.5 trillion in federal funding for public schools, affordable housing, healthcare, infrastructure, and other vital programs. She also successfully fought attempts by the Trump Administration to undercount immigrant communities and represented the city as the Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel at the NYC Law Department on the citizenship census case and other legal matters. Under her leadership, New York City surpassed expectations and actually had 4 of the top 5 counties in America in terms of exceeding census expectations of population growth. Julie achieved this historic census success despite a global pandemic and efforts from the Trump Administration to sabotage the count.  Julie previously served as the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, where she reinvigorated the agency by increasing consumer restitution by 70 percent, instituting 25 reforms to lower fines on small businesses where there was no consumer harm, implementing the Paid Sick Leave Law, and launching trailblazing legal investigations into for-profit colleges, debt collectors, banks, predatory lenders and other industries preying on New Yorkers. She launched a new Earned Income Tax Credit initiative that resulted in over $260 million being returned to low-income New Yorkers. Julie created a new city initiative to seed over 13,000 kindergarteners with a college savings account and chaired the board of New York City Kids Rise, a not-for-profit organization she helped to create charged with implementing this program which has now been adopted citywide.  Julie also previously served as Commissioner of Media and Entertainment where she implemented dozens of initiatives to increase gender equity. Faced with industries that were not diversified and lacked gender equity, Julie launched new programs to increase women’s representation and opportunities in film, TV, theater, and the music industry such as the first-ever women’s film fund, job training programs to increase gender equity in the film, theater, TV and music industries and a slate of new women’s programming on the city’s TV channels. These programs have been held up as a national model and utilized as a paradigm for other cities. She also increased film and TV production to historic heights resulting in thousands of jobs for working families. Julie negotiated the historic deal to bring the Grammy Awards back to New York in 2017, resulting in a $200 million economic benefit for New York City.  Before becoming a Commissioner, Julie served as a seven-year Chair of Manhattan Community Board 1 and is widely credited with helping to lead Lower Manhattan’s resurgence after 9/11. Several weeks after her small business was badly damaged on 9/11, she founded the not-for-profit organization Wall Street Rising, which focused on the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan for residents and small businesses and developed it into an organization with over 30,000 members. As Chairperson of Community Board 1, she facilitated the building of three new schools including the city’s first green school, new parks, and affordable housing, and led the charge in favor of the Islamic Cultural Center and freedom of religion. Additionally, Julie fought for and won $150 million for downtown community needs from a battle with Con Edison as part of her work with Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Julie has also successfully implemented legislation at the city and state level, including winning a two-year fight to mandate life-saving epi-pens on all ambulances statewide.  Prior to her career in public service, Julie practiced law as a regulatory and litigation attorney. She has served on the board of the Women’s Campaign Fund, where she helped launch She Should Run, a nationwide initiative that has encouraged thousands of women to run for elected office, and served on the board of Eleanor’s Legacy, an organization in New York focused on electing more Democratic women statewide. In addition, she has served on the board of trustees of Columbia University, the Downtown Hospital, the Municipal Arts Society, and on the boards of Vera Institute of Justice’s Reform Leadership Council, the September 11th Memorial Foundation and the WTC Performing Arts Center.  She received her undergraduate degree from Columbia University magna cum laude. She received her law degree from Northwestern University School of Law. She serves on the National Advisory Board for Public Service at Harvard University.  Julie has been recognized as a Women’s Campaign Fund Rising Star, Citizen Union’s Civic Leader, City and State’s “40 Under 40,” “Power 100 Women,” and “Top 25 Women in Public Service.” She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including Columbia University’s John Jay award and the League of Conservation Voters Public Service award. She has served as a frequent national commentator on law and politics and has appeared nationally on CNN, The Today Show, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and other outlets and previously hosted and co-produced a local NBC cable news show focused on politics and law.
