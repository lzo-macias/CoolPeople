EPISODE WELCOMES NEWLY ELECTED NYC COUNCIL MEMBER CARMEN DE LA ROSA TO HIGHLIGHT WOMEN IN POLITICS AND THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT DURING EMERGENCIES ¡Prepárate! { Click to listen to episode 11 } March 16, 2022 ― The 2021 election year was filled with many first and trailblazing results, including the election of the second African-American Mayor in Eric Adams and New York City Council Speaker Adrienne E. Adams, as the first African-American woman in this role. And as we celebrate Women’s History Month, the election results also marked the first time women in the New York City Council held a majority (31-out-of-51 seats), including Carmen De La Rosa, the first Dominican woman to represent District 10. On the latest episode of ¡Prepárate!, NYC Emergency Management’s Spanish-language podcast, co-hosts Inés Bebea and Yokarina Duarte celebrate Women’s History Month with newly elected Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, who represents Marble Hill, Inwood and Washington Heights for District 10. But before joining the City Council, De La Rosa was elected to the New York State Assembly (representing the 72nd District) in November 2016. Her entry into politics was with NYS Assemblymember Daniel O’Donnell as his budget and services manager. During the episode, De La Rosa describes her passion for politics, being a role model to other women interested in politics, balancing work and family and overcoming obstacles that her male counterparts do not face. “I look forward to continuing to work closely with NYC Emergency Management to help protect the people of Upper Manhattan and prepare for emergencies. As a district with a large immigrant population, it is essential factors such as age, race, gender, and income are not barriers to safety and recovery for our community," said Council Member De La Rosa . "Thank you to Yokarina and Inés for inviting me to the ¡Prepárate! podcast and using the platform to share safety tips with the Spanish speaking community.” As a member of the New York City Council, De La Rosa said she will work closely with New York City Emergency Management and other response agencies to prepare her constituents for emergencies. De La Rosa’s district has a large immigrant and minority population, factors that according to the federal government, make minority communities more vulnerable to health disparities and impacts from climate change. The federal government has identified age, race, education attainment, income, and ethnicity as factors that impact an individual or family’s ability to prepare and recover from emergencies, something that De La Rosa is working to address in her community. You can listen to ¡Prepárate! on SoundCloud and Spotify . Profile Profile New York City Council Member Carmen De La Rosa emigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood, where she continues to live. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. In November 2016, De La Rosa was elected to represent her community as the State Assemblymember of the 72nd District. Since her first day in office, she has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice. She successfully negotiated and passed the New York State DREAM ACT and the first in the nation Excluded Workers Fund (EWF) at $2.1 billion. As the member of the Assembly representing the district with the highest number of rent-stabilized apartments, Carmen actively participated in passing the strongest tenant protection laws in a generation. On June 22, 2021, De La Rosa was victorious in the Democratic primary and subsequently won the general election on November 2nd, becoming the first Dominican woman elected to represent District 10 at City Hall. De La Rosa received her bachelor’s degree from Fordham University. -30- MEDIA CONTACT : Inés Bebea (718) 422-4888 STAY CONNECTED : Twitter: @NotifyNYC (emergency notifications); @NNYCSpanish @nycemergencymgt (emergency preparedness info); Facebook: /NYCemergencymanagement   NYC City of New York. 2025 All Rights Reserved, NYC is a trademark and service mark of the City of New York Privacy Policy.

Introduction This bill would require New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) to disseminate localized emergency preparedness materials in locations that are prone to flash floods, in order to increase public awareness as to the appropriate responses by members of the public to flash flood risks and to increase registration for an emergency notification system. Such efforts would involve outreach conduct in-person and via mass mailings, and target locations selected with consideration of: (i) a history of flash flood events; and (iii) the prevalence of subgrade dwellings.

Introduction The Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act was enacted by City Council in 2020 and requires the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate and report on surveillance technologies used by the Department. This legislation would add new provisions to the law which would require that the NYPD, upon request, provide the Department of Investigation (DOI) with an itemized list of all surveillance technologies currently used by the Department, and provide information on all data access and retention policies for data collected by such technologies.

Additionally, NYPD would be required to develop policies regarding the circumstances under which any local, state, or federal government agency has access to data collected by the department using surveillance technology; and develop an internal tracking system to monitor instances where external entities are provided access to data gathered by surveillance technologeis.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise.

Additionally, NYPD would be required to develop policies regarding the circumstances under which any local, state, or federal government agency has access to data collected by the department using surveillance technology; and develop an internal tracking system to monitor instances where external entities are provided access to data gathered by surveillance technologeis.

Introduction This bill would codify the City’s cooling center program. The legislation would grant DOHMH, in conjunction with OEM, the discretion of designating the number and location of cooling centers, but would require that there be no fewer than the median number of cooling centers operated during heat-related emergencies in 2017. In designating such centers, the agencies would have to take into account where vulnerable populations reside and where such populations would be likely to use centers. In addition, DOHMH would be required to post information about the cooling center program on its website and would also have to conduct a public education campaign to increase awareness of cooling centers and the risks associated with heat-related emergencies and poor air quality. Finally, DOHMH would have to conduct an annual survey on utilization of the program and submit a report annually to the Mayor and City Council on the program.

The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner.

The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors.

This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

Oversight Not available Not available Int 0566-2024 * Gale A. Brewer Annual plan to expand access to school playgrounds. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to consult with the Department of Education (DOE) to create and submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council an annual plan to expand public access to school playgrounds. The plan would need to prioritize playgrounds that are located in environmental justice areas and include, for the upcoming year, a list of at least 25 school playgrounds that could be maintained and operated by DPR and DOE and used by the public on weekends and after school hours, a list of the duties of DPR and DOE in relation to increasing the number of playgrounds available to the public, the estimated budget required, and any challenges with implementing the plan. Not available Not available Int 0573-2024 * Gale A. Brewer Increasing the number of drinking fountains adjacent to public parks and greenstreets. Introduction This bill would require a regular evaluation of the need for drinking fountains on locations under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation that are adjacent to non-park land. The bill also requires the installation of a certain number of additional drinking fountains. Not available Not available Int 0643-2024 * Kevin C. Riley Plan to identify and facilitate the use of indoor facilities for basketball games. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), in coordination with the Department of Education (DOE), to create a plan that would identify and facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms for organized basketball leagues to use when weather would not permit use of outdoor basketball courts. The plan would need to address how DPR will facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms that are maintained or operated by the city, how DPR will coordinate with other relevant agencies to facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms, and ways to identify private indoor basketball courts and gyms that are available for use by basketball leagues.

No. 391-A Studying sidewalk shed designs and improving the aesthetics of existing sidewalk sheds. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) to complete a study and recommend to the Council the use of new sidewalk shed designs by September 30, 2025. Additionally, this bill would require DOB to promulgate rules for the use of containment netting as a sidewalk shed alternative. This bill would also expand the allowable color palette of sidewalk sheds beyond hunter green, to include metallic gray, white, or a color matching the façade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building; corresponding construction fences would be required to match the color of the sidewalk shed. Finally, this bill would increase the size of lighting installed beneath sidewalk sheds, particularly for sheds covering subway entrances, bus shelters, or other transit facilities, and increase the minimum height of sidewalk sheds to 12 feet, with a lower height allowed in areas where egress, light, or ventilation would be obstructed.

Introduction This bill would reduce the duration of sidewalk shed permits issued in connection with a façade repair from 1 year to 3 months. The duration of sidewalk shed permits connected to demolition, a building alteration, or new building construction would remain undisturbed. This bill would also create new penalties enforceable by the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) for sidewalk sheds occupying the public right of way where a building owner has failed to conduct necessary façade repairs in a timely manner. Penalties would be enforced beginning with the second permit renewal, increasing based on the size and age of the shed. Finally, reports accompanying an application for a sidewalk shed permit renewal would be required to include information on work performed during the period of time since the last renewal; if work has not been performed during that time, documentation illustrating the applicable reason for the lack of work may be accepted by DOB for the purpose of renewing the permit.

No. 391-A Studying sidewalk shed designs and improving the aesthetics of existing sidewalk sheds. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) to complete a study and recommend to the Council the use of new sidewalk shed designs by September 30, 2025. Additionally, this bill would require DOB to promulgate rules for the use of containment netting as a sidewalk shed alternative. This bill would also expand the allowable color palette of sidewalk sheds beyond hunter green, to include metallic gray, white, or a color matching the façade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building; corresponding construction fences would be required to match the color of the sidewalk shed. Finally, this bill would increase the size of lighting installed beneath sidewalk sheds, particularly for sheds covering subway entrances, bus shelters, or other transit facilities, and increase the minimum height of sidewalk sheds to 12 feet, with a lower height allowed in areas where egress, light, or ventilation would be obstructed.

Approved by Committee Pass Action details Not available Not available Int 0393-2024 * Keith Powers  Proposed Int. No. 393-A Removing construction-related equipment. Introduction This bill would reduce the duration of sidewalk shed permits issued in connection with a façade repair from 1 year to 3 months. The duration of sidewalk shed permits connected to demolition, a building alteration, or new building construction would remain undisturbed. This bill would also create new penalties enforceable by the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) for sidewalk sheds occupying the public right of way where a building owner has failed to conduct necessary façade repairs in a timely manner. Penalties would be enforced beginning with the second permit renewal, increasing based on the size and age of the shed. Finally, reports accompanying an application for a sidewalk shed permit renewal would be required to include information on work performed during the period of time since the last renewal; if work has not been performed during that time, documentation illustrating the applicable reason for the lack of work may be accepted by DOB for the purpose of renewing the permit.

Introduction This bill would codify the City’s cooling center program. The legislation would grant DOHMH, in conjunction with OEM, the discretion of designating the number and location of cooling centers, but would require that there be no fewer than the median number of cooling centers operated during heat-related emergencies in 2017. In designating such centers, the agencies would have to take into account where vulnerable populations reside and where such populations would be likely to use centers. In addition, DOHMH would be required to post information about the cooling center program on its website and would also have to conduct a public education campaign to increase awareness of cooling centers and the risks associated with heat-related emergencies and poor air quality. Finally, DOHMH would have to conduct an annual survey on utilization of the program and submit a report annually to the Mayor and City Council on the program.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Español BIOGRAPHY ISSUES EVENTS DONATE    VOLUNTEER Meet Carmen De La Rosa Meet Carmen De La Rosa Carmen De La Rosa immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood where she has lived her entire life. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. As an Assembly Member, she is driven by the needs of our people.  She led the passage of the NYS Dream Act to provide access to education to all students regardless of immigration status, and worked with organizers and advocates to reshape the lives of tenants, delivering real rent reform. Carmen is the lead sponsor in the Assembly for a billionaires tax to #TaxTheRich that will ensure the ultrawealthy finally pay their fair share and help us close budget gaps wreaked by COVID-19. Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect  frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses. Carmen De La Rosa is the leader this moment requires. vulnerable  About District 10 District 10 is home to the vibrant communities of Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill. Since the 1900s, these neighborhoods have been the homes of immigrant communities such as Cubans, German Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans and now Dominicans who are the primary immigrant group.  Uptown Manhattan is home to the highest number of Dominicans of any neighborhood in the United States who account for nearly 100,000 of the residents. This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers.

This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers. The history of the district, however, is tainted with inequities and exclusion in government. Gentrification threatens the very fabric of the community as long-time residents are pushed out for newer, wealthier ones. Small businesses, too, find it increasingly difficult to survive with rising rents.  When COVID-19 hit, our district one of the hardest hit in the city—highlighting just how much essential workers sacrifice to keep our city running. The next 10 years will be pivotal for our district: we must stop gentrification and build a city that is centered around the needs of the working class. Let’s build truly affordable housing, fund public schools, and support services that will help our community thrive. The structure of power in our community will change on June 22nd, 2021. Make sure your voice is heard. Click Here to Register to Vote.  On the Issues Carmen De La Rosa has used her voice & platform to demand criminal justice reform, the strengthening of rent stabilization laws that protect and prioritize low-income tenants, stood firmly for women’s rights and equality, and has been a leading voice in the development of policies around Mental Health services for minority communities and suicide prevention. Carmen is passionate about using government as a tool for social change and a vehicle to empower and support communities.

In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly.

In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. As an Assembly Member, she is driven by the needs of our people.  She led the passage of the NYS Dream Act to provide access to education to all students regardless of immigration status, and worked with organizers and advocates to reshape the lives of tenants, delivering real rent reform. Carmen is the lead sponsor in the Assembly for a billionaires tax to #TaxTheRich that will ensure the ultrawealthy finally pay their fair share and help us close budget gaps wreaked by COVID-19. Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect  frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses. Carmen De La Rosa is the leader this moment requires. vulnerable  About District 10 District 10 is home to the vibrant communities of Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill. Since the 1900s, these neighborhoods have been the homes of immigrant communities such as Cubans, German Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans and now Dominicans who are the primary immigrant group.  Uptown Manhattan is home to the highest number of Dominicans of any neighborhood in the United States who account for nearly 100,000 of the residents. This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers.

This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers. The history of the district, however, is tainted with inequities and exclusion in government. Gentrification threatens the very fabric of the community as long-time residents are pushed out for newer, wealthier ones. Small businesses, too, find it increasingly difficult to survive with rising rents.  When COVID-19 hit, our district one of the hardest hit in the city—highlighting just how much essential workers sacrifice to keep our city running. The next 10 years will be pivotal for our district: we must stop gentrification and build a city that is centered around the needs of the working class. Let’s build truly affordable housing, fund public schools, and support services that will help our community thrive. The structure of power in our community will change on June 22nd, 2021.

English BIOGRAFIA PLATAFORMA    VOLUNTEER Conoce a Carmen De La Rosa Conoce a Carmen De La Rosa Carmen De La Rosa emigró de República Dominicana cuando era niña y creció en Inwood, donde ha vivido toda su vida. Su defensa y pasión por la justicia están profundamente influenciadas por sus raíces. Ha escuchado y defendido a los más vulnerables, incluso antes de comenzar su carrera en el gobierno. En noviembre de 2016, Carmen fue elegida para representarnos en la Asamblea del Estado de Nueva York. Desde su primer día en el cargo, Carmen ha luchado contra el racismo, la xenofobia y la injusticia económica y su compromiso con la comunidad que ama continúa. Como asambleísta, ella está impulsada por las necesidades de nuestra gente. Lideró la aprobación de la NYS Dream Act para brindar acceso a la educación a todos los estudiantes independientemente de su estatus migratorio, y trabajó con organizadores y defensores para remodelar la vida de los inquilinos, logrando una verdadera reforma del alquiler. Carmen es la patrocinadora principal en la Asamblea de un impuesto a los multimillonarios,#TaxTheRich, que garantizará que los ultrarricos finalmente paguen su parte justa y nos ayudará a cerrar las brechas presupuestarias causadas por COVID-19. Carmen luchará para asegurarse de que las necesidades de nuestra comunidad estén a la vanguardia . Ella luchará para proteger a nuestra comunidad del desarrollo irresponsable y el desplazamiento, desmantelará fallas fundamentales en nuestro sistema de justicia penal, expandirá nuestras redes de seguridad social, arreglará nuestro sistema educativo roto y protegerá a los trabajadores de primera línea y las pequeñas empresas vulnerables. Carmen De La Rosa es la líder que requiere este momento. Sobre el Distrito 10 El Distrito 10 es el hogar de las vibrantes comunidades de Washington Heights, Inwood y Marble Hill. Desde la década de 1900, estos vecindarios han sido el hogar de comunidades de inmigrantes como cubanos, judíos alemanes, rusos, puertorriqueños y ahora dominicanos que son el principal grupo de inmigrantes. Uptown Manhattan es el hogar de la mayor cantidad de dominicanos de cualquier vecindario en los Estados Unidos que representan casi 100,000 de los residentes. Esto le ha valido a Uptown el apodo de Pequeña República Dominicana. El distrito es el hogar de muchas personas mayores, familias de clase trabajadora y trabajadores esenciales. Sin embargo, la historia del distrito está teñida de inequidades y exclusión en el gobierno. La gentrificación amenaza el tejido mismo de la comunidad a medida que los residentes antiguos son empujados por otros más nuevos y ricos. También a las pequeñas empresas les resulta cada vez más difícil sobrevivir con el aumento de los alquileres. Cuando llegó el COVID-19, nuestro distrito fue uno de los más afectados de la ciudad, destacando cuánto se sacrifican los trabajadores esenciales para mantener nuestra ciudad en funcionamiento. Los próximos 10 años serán fundamentales para nuestro distrito: debemos detener la gentrificación y construir una ciudad que se centre en las necesidades de la clase trabajadora. Construyamos viviendas verdaderamente asequibles, financiemos escuelas públicas y servicios de apoyo que ayudarán a nuestra comunidad a prosperar. La estructura de poder en nuestra comunidad cambiará el 22 de junio de 2021. Asegúrese de que su voz sea escuchada. Haga clic aquí para registrarse para votar. El Plan de Carmen Carmen De La Rosa ha utilizado su voz y su plataforma para exigir una reforma de la justicia penal, el fortalecimiento de las leyes de estabilización de alquileres que protegen y priorizan a los inquilinos de bajos ingresos, defendió firmemente los derechos y la igualdad de las mujeres y ha sido una voz líder en el desarrollo de políticas. en torno a los servicios de salud mental para las comunidades minoritarias y la prevención del suicidio. A Carmen le apasiona usar el gobierno como una herramienta para el cambio social y un vehículo para empoderar y apoyar a las comunidades.

Español BIOGRAPHY ISSUES EVENTS DONATE    VOLUNTEER Meet Carmen De La Rosa Meet Carmen De La Rosa Carmen De La Rosa immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood where she has lived her entire life. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent us in the New York State Assembly. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice and her commitment to the community she loves continues. As an Assembly Member, she is driven by the needs of our people.  She led the passage of the NYS Dream Act to provide access to education to all students regardless of immigration status, and worked with organizers and advocates to reshape the lives of tenants, delivering real rent reform. Carmen is the lead sponsor in the Assembly for a billionaires tax to #TaxTheRich that will ensure the ultrawealthy finally pay their fair share and help us close budget gaps wreaked by COVID-19. Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect  frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses. Carmen De La Rosa is the leader this moment requires. vulnerable  About District 10 District 10 is home to the vibrant communities of Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill. Since the 1900s, these neighborhoods have been the homes of immigrant communities such as Cubans, German Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans and now Dominicans who are the primary immigrant group.  Uptown Manhattan is home to the highest number of Dominicans of any neighborhood in the United States who account for nearly 100,000 of the residents. This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers.

This has earned Uptown the nickname of Little Dominican Republic. The district is home to many seniors, working-class families, and essential workers. The history of the district, however, is tainted with inequities and exclusion in government. Gentrification threatens the very fabric of the community as long-time residents are pushed out for newer, wealthier ones. Small businesses, too, find it increasingly difficult to survive with rising rents.  When COVID-19 hit, our district one of the hardest hit in the city—highlighting just how much essential workers sacrifice to keep our city running. The next 10 years will be pivotal for our district: we must stop gentrification and build a city that is centered around the needs of the working class. Let’s build truly affordable housing, fund public schools, and support services that will help our community thrive. The structure of power in our community will change on June 22nd, 2021. Make sure your voice is heard. Click Here to Register to Vote.  On the Issues Carmen De La Rosa has used her voice & platform to demand criminal justice reform, the strengthening of rent stabilization laws that protect and prioritize low-income tenants, stood firmly for women’s rights and equality, and has been a leading voice in the development of policies around Mental Health services for minority communities and suicide prevention. Carmen is passionate about using government as a tool for social change and a vehicle to empower and support communities.
