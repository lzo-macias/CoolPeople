0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Shahana understands that the climate crisis is an increasingly present threat in our district and globally that requires urgent actions. With storms becoming more frequent and extreme, including the drought in November 2024 and the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida, we must prepare for the realities of a changing climate. As such, she has taken important steps to make Brooklyn a climate leader. Shahana’s Accomplishments: Shahana introduced and passed historic legislation instituting New York City’s first Citywide Curbside Composting program, the largest in the country. Thanks to this law, every New Yorker can now ensure their food waste goes to a productive use instead of being sent to a landfill or an incinerator. Shahana launched the City’s first climate justice-focused Participatory Budgeting cycle, investing $1.5 million into resiliency projects in District 39, developed through grassroots input. Alongside climate advocates, Shahana has pushed for the full and timely implementation of Local Law 97, and has sponsored Int. 1180 to eliminate important loopholes in the law. Shahana has worked closely with the Department of Environmental Protection to engage community town halls focusing on the agency’s plans on flood mitigation and adaptation strategies in the district. She and her team have also gone door to door to educate constituents, collaborating with local groups like The City Sponge and Field Form, who have been instrumental in efforts to prevent flooding in the district. Shahana oversaw the completion of the BED 798 sewer main construction in northern Park Slope, a critical project that reduces flood risks and supports green infrastructure initiatives to improve stormwater management. Shahana has hosted regular rain barrel distributions, e-recycling, and paper shredding events, empowering residents to take action on climate by reducing waste and conserving water. Shahana’s Vision: By 2050, large sections of the City will be underwater during high tide, and Shahana has been a strong advocate for expanding infrastructure to handle storm surge and increased water runoff. In her district, she will continue to track the progress of the $230 million combined relief sewer upgrade project in Gowanus. Shahana is actively exploring legislation to expand more green spaces in the City, expand resiliency projects, reduce the city’s dependency on fossil fuels through improvements to its fleet, grow mesh networks to provide free Wi-Fi for all, and reduce urban heat islands. Shahana believes these efforts should be part of a comprehensive Green New Deal that prioritizes racial and gender equity and creates green collar jobs. Shahana will work closely with DSNY to ensure her composting legislation is implemented effectively. This includes improving compliance, collection, and processing. Shahana is working closely with local neighbors to ensure that the Brooklyn Marine Terminal project has robust community engagement and delivers tangible benefits for nearby residents.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu As a Council Member, Shahana has taken a holistic approach to public safety, working closely with local precincts, community members, and grassroots organizations to address violence and keep our neighborhoods safe. She has fought for proactive investments in mental health, gun violence prevention, and re-entry programs that are proven to stop harm from occurring. When violence happens, she works with the NYPD to support victims and ensure they have the resources they need to recover and pursue justice. Shahana’s Accomplishments: In 2024, in response to harassment reports in Park Slope, Shahana took decisive action. She advocated for increased police patrols with the 78th Precinct , launched a comprehensive awareness campaign to prioritize women’s safety in the neighborhood, and organized a series of initiatives, including a self-defense class, to empower and equip community members. The City Council passed Shahana’s bill, Local Law 45, which codified the Home+ program and provides survivors of domestic and gender-based violence with free lock changes, personal safety alarms, and window and door repairs. This helps survivors stay safely in their homes. Shahana was also a vocal supporter of the Survivor Support Package, a collaborative effort with Queens Council Member Tiffany Cabán, which introduced a housing stability grant program for domestic violence survivors. Shahana has worked closely with organizations like Sakhi for South Asian Survivors and the Asiyah Women’s Center to help women begin new lives after escaping abusive situations. She helped Justice Innovation secure a $1 million federal grant to expand their restorative justice programs across schools in the John Jay complex. She knows that stopping and repairing violence at the student level is critical to building a safer New York. Shahana has been a consistent advocate for substantive police reform and accountability. As Progressive Caucus Co-Chair, she played a key role in passing the How Many Stops Act , holding the NYPD accountable for discriminatory practices. She has also opposed NYPD’s biased use of surveillance and spoken out against corruption within the department under Mayor Adams’ leadership. Shahana continues to stand with families grieving loved ones lost to police violence and will keep holding the NYPD accountable for its actions. Shahana has fought to root out the most inhumane aspects of the carceral system including championing Public Advocate Jumaane Williams’s law to ban solitary confinement. Shahana has secured important safety improvements for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit riders as explained in the Street Safety, Transportation, and Open Spaces section below. Shahana’s Vision: Shahana believes that true public safety requires a fundamental shift in how we allocate resources and approach community safety. Instead of prioritizing police force and brutality, we must recommit our resources to community-based safety programs and effective responses, including fully funding social services and investing in violence prevention, interruption, and response programs. As co-chair of the Progressive Caucus she has launched the Crisis to Care budget campaign to invest in mental health treatment, supportive housing, and holistic crisis response. Shahana recognizes that the NYPD needs major reform from the top down. The department suffers from insufficient external accountability, rampant abuse of power, and the return of harmful practices like racist stop-and-frisk and Broken Windows policing. She strongly supports disbanding units like the Strategic Response Group and the Vice Squad, which have terrorized communities rather than protected them. Shahana will continue working in close partnership with local precincts, local businesses, community members, and grassroots organizations to address safety concerns in our neighborhoods, ensuring that any changes to policing are responsive to the needs and desires of the community. Shahana will continue to support anti-domestic violence organizations, with a particular focus on those that assist immigrant and limited-English proficient survivors, ensuring that these communities have the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives. Shahana will keep pushing to improve safety for detained people and corrections staff through legislation like her Intro. 206 , which would increase access to Narcan in jails to combat the epidemic of drug-related deaths on Rikers Island. Shahana will continue urging the Mayor to follow the City’s legal mandate to close the jail facilities on Rikers Island by 2027. While the facilities remain open, she supports appointing an independent federal receiver to take over operations.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Shahana knows Brooklyn is at its best when workers are empowered and our beloved local establishments are thriving. She’s equally at home on picket lines with striking union workers and helping small business owners cut through bureaucratic red tape. Through both her legislative and constituent services work, she is working to build a just economy in which New Yorkers can lead lasting and fulfilling careers. Shahana’s Accomplishments: Shahana has collaborated closely with businesses owners and business improvement districts to address issues like break-ins, trash management, and low foot traffic. She coordinates with DSNY, NYPD, and SBS to help businesses get fast and effective city services. Shahana has sponsored and voted for numerous laws to support small businesses, including reducing commercial vacancies , reducing unnecessary and costly fines , and improving multi-lingual services for immigrant-owned establishments. Shahana partnered with the labor movement to author and pass the City’s multilingual Workers’ Bill of Rights law. This law ensures that all workers, regardless of citizenship status, have access to information about their workplace protections. She fought with immigrant taxi drivers to secure forgiveness for $450 million in debt caused by the City-created medallion crisis, even going on hunger strike for 10 days to support the cause. Shahana successfully pushed the City to implement the first minimum wage for delivery workers , improving take home pay for one of the City’s lowest earning job sectors. As a Council Member, Shahana has been a vocal supporter of workers organizing in her district and helped them win union recognition and first contracts. Shahana helped launch the Care Forward program to improve conditions and pay for domestic workers and nannies in her district. Shahana has fought hard for our arts and culture sector, helping to stave off potentially devastating cuts that Mayor Adams proposed. She’s used her Office’s discretionary funding to support local performing arts institutions and events that bring vibrancy to our neighborhoods. Shahana’s Vision: Shahana understands that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and she will continue to fight for policies that support their growth while ensuring fair treatment for workers. She will work to eliminate burdensome regulations that make it harder for small businesses to succeed, all while holding those businesses accountable for providing fair wages, safe working conditions, and the benefits that workers deserve. Shahana authored and is pushing to pass Intro 1076 , which would make Middle Eastern and North African (MENA)-owned businesses eligible for city contracts under the City’s M/WBE program. Currently, they are ineligible as MENA communities are classified as “White” under U.S. Census standards. Shahana will continue to support workers’ efforts to unionize, stand alongside striking workers on the picket line, and fight for workers to have livable wages and dignified working conditions. She will work to get her bill, Intro 204 , over the finish line to extend paid sick leave for thousands of gig workers. Shahana recently introduced and is organizing to pass the Tip Theft Prevention Act , which would establish new protections to ensure food service workers get all of the money they’ve earned and crack down on union-busting tactics. As a co-sponsor of the Secure Jobs Act, Shahana is committed to ensuring that workers are protected from unjust and arbitrary firings, fighting for job security and economic justice for all. As a co-sponsor of the Construction Justice Act, Shahana is pushing to lift up standards for construction workers. Shahana will continue advocating to end 24-hour shifts for home care workers, primarily immigrant women and women of color, ensuring fair working conditions, better pay, and adequate rest for those who provide essential care to New York’s most vulnerable populations. Shahana will remain a strong ally of Care Forward and is committed to introducing legislation that establishes a Worker Standards Board for domestic workers in New York City, modeled after the successful initiative in Seattle. This board will set fair labor standards, improve working conditions, and ensure better protections for domestic workers across the city, who are predominantly low-income women of color. Shahana will continue to stand with immigrant workers’ movements, including those led by Los Deliveristas Unidos and the NY Taxi Workers Alliance. She has co-authored important legislation to end unjust deactivations from apps like Uber and Lyft without notice, cause, or appeal. Shahana knows that arts and culture aren’t a luxury; they are essential. She will continue fighting to get artists what they need to be able to continue to create in Brooklyn. She supports policies including increasing the number of subsidized artist studios, dedicated artist housing, and the federal Living Wage for Musicians Act .

These residents had faced discrimination and language barriers for years, but together we won critical upgrades and repairs, and fought for the funding our communities needed. I also worked directly with survivors of domestic violence to ensure they could safely escape abusive situations. Over a decade ago, I joined Sakhi for South Asian Survivors to support their work in Kensington, where they had the highest intake of survivors. With my neighbors, I helped form The Kensington Stewards to transform an empty lot into Avenue C Plaza, a vibrant public space for everyone to enjoy. There weren’t enough parks or open spaces for children to play or for women to take up space. So, we built the plaza and activated it with cultural programming to make it a true community hub.” For example, after receiving multiple complaints about trash on Court Street, we secured additional trash cans within just 48 hours. That’s what real constituent service looks like—swift, efficient action that directly improves your daily life. Some of our highlights: We’ve made significant strides in accessibility, including opening the elevators at the 7th Avenue F/G station, building a protected bike lane on 9th Street, and installing wheelchair-accessible swings at Van Voorhees Park. We’ve also expanded critical community services: our immigration legal clinic in Kensington now operates weekly, and our monthly food distribution has provided nearly 2,500 bags of food to working-class families in 2024. Also in 2024, District 39 entered the top 10 City Council districts for new affordable housing, with the opening of 633 units and the Gowanus rezoning paving the way for thousands more.

Earlier in her career as a housing organizer, she worked to build tenant power and keep New Yorkers in their homes. Now in the Council, she is taking the fight straight to both the real estate lobby and combating the affordable housing shortage. Shahana’s Accomplishments: Shahana helped make District 39 rank in the top ten Council districts for new affordable housing in 2023, with 633 new units and thousands more on the way. She created 100 new affordable units in Windsor Terrace on a formerly industrial site through the Arrow Linen Rezoning Project .

This education effort has successfully directed patients in need to services in the five boroughs. She has made sure out-of-state patients have been able to successfully access services by securing an annual $1 Million investment in the New York Abortion Access Fund that covers practical support for people living in or traveling to New York. This is the largest municipal program of this kind in the country. Her Local Law 76 of 2022 created a legal shield for people accessing abortion care, ensuring the City will protect patients from anti-choice suits.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu In this moment of rising hate—especially antisemitism—Shahana has actively listened to feedback on how her office can better strengthen safety, build bridges, and speak out against all forms of hate. While figures like Donald Trump and the far-right attempt to divide us, Shahana has remained steadfast in her mission to unite our communities, just as she has throughout her career. Shahana’s Accomplishments: With antisemitism and Islamophobia on the rise in New York City, Shahana co-sponsored Local Law 4 to increase security funding available for non-public schools, including yeshivas and Islamic schools. With hate violence remaining an urgent concern to these school communities, she is proud the City Council made an investment in making more students and more schools safe. Shahana worked with an interfaith coalition to author and pass her Resolution 95 calling on the DOE to adopt a curriculum that teaches students about the diversity of religions that help shape New York City. She knows that we can fight hate by fostering understanding, respect, and mutual appreciation among our youth. As Co-Chair of the City Council’s Task Force to Combat Hate, Shahana has convened roundtables of LGBTQ+, Jewish, Muslim, and AAPI students across the city to gather input on combating discrimination in schools. In the 39th District, she has also worked closely with rabbis, imams, and community leaders to respond to their needs, forge new partnerships, and strengthen existing ones. During Jewish and Muslim holidays, Shahana works with local precincts to request increased patrols around houses of worship for added safety. She has also met with Jewish and Muslim constituents affected by bias incidents, acting as a liaison between them and the police to ensure concerns were addressed. Shanana supported $2.5 million in the budget for Holocaust education for 8th graders, and also organized a field trip to the Museum of Jewish Heritage with Millennium High School in Park Slope. Shahana’s Vision: Shahana will continue to lead the fight to eradicate hate in all its forms. After numerous conversations with Jewish leaders, organizations, and constituents, Shahana authored Intro 203 to address the rise in antisemitic hate crimes in our city. This legislation would require the City government to conduct an annual public awareness campaign aimed at combating antisemitism. She remains committed to advancing this critical piece of legislation, which is backed by prominent organizations like the New York Jewish Agenda (NYJA) and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ).

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

She has served as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs and Commissioner of Media and Entertainment. She previously served as a Columbia adjunct professor teaching on city and state government, preemption and home rule.  The daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Julie is a third-generation New Yorker who lives in Yorkville with her husband and her children.  As the 2020 New York City Census Director, Julie led a historically successful effort as New York City gained more population than any city in America. Her leadership was responsible for ensuring that New York City receives its fair share of over $1.5 trillion in federal funding for public schools, affordable housing, healthcare, infrastructure, and other vital programs. She also successfully fought attempts by the Trump Administration to undercount immigrant communities and represented the city as the Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel at the NYC Law Department on the citizenship census case and other legal matters. Under her leadership, New York City surpassed expectations and actually had 4 of the top 5 counties in America in terms of exceeding census expectations of population growth. Julie achieved this historic census success despite a global pandemic and efforts from the Trump Administration to sabotage the count.  Julie previously served as the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, where she reinvigorated the agency by increasing consumer restitution by 70 percent, instituting 25 reforms to lower fines on small businesses where there was no consumer harm, implementing the Paid Sick Leave Law, and launching trailblazing legal investigations into for-profit colleges, debt collectors, banks, predatory lenders and other industries preying on New Yorkers. She launched a new Earned Income Tax Credit initiative that resulted in over $260 million being returned to low-income New Yorkers. Julie created a new city initiative to seed over 13,000 kindergarteners with a college savings account and chaired the board of New York City Kids Rise, a not-for-profit organization she helped to create charged with implementing this program which has now been adopted citywide.  Julie also previously served as Commissioner of Media and Entertainment where she implemented dozens of initiatives to increase gender equity. Faced with industries that were not diversified and lacked gender equity, Julie launched new programs to increase women’s representation and opportunities in film, TV, theater, and the music industry such as the first-ever women’s film fund, job training programs to increase gender equity in the film, theater, TV and music industries and a slate of new women’s programming on the city’s TV channels. These programs have been held up as a national model and utilized as a paradigm for other cities. She also increased film and TV production to historic heights resulting in thousands of jobs for working families. Julie negotiated the historic deal to bring the Grammy Awards back to New York in 2017, resulting in a $200 million economic benefit for New York City.  Before becoming a Commissioner, Julie served as a seven-year Chair of Manhattan Community Board 1 and is widely credited with helping to lead Lower Manhattan’s resurgence after 9/11. Several weeks after her small business was badly damaged on 9/11, she founded the not-for-profit organization Wall Street Rising, which focused on the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan for residents and small businesses and developed it into an organization with over 30,000 members. As Chairperson of Community Board 1, she facilitated the building of three new schools including the city’s first green school, new parks, and affordable housing, and led the charge in favor of the Islamic Cultural Center and freedom of religion. Additionally, Julie fought for and won $150 million for downtown community needs from a battle with Con Edison as part of her work with Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Julie has also successfully implemented legislation at the city and state level, including winning a two-year fight to mandate life-saving epi-pens on all ambulances statewide.  Prior to her career in public service, Julie practiced law as a regulatory and litigation attorney. She has served on the board of the Women’s Campaign Fund, where she helped launch She Should Run, a nationwide initiative that has encouraged thousands of women to run for elected office, and served on the board of Eleanor’s Legacy, an organization in New York focused on electing more Democratic women statewide. In addition, she has served on the board of trustees of Columbia University, the Downtown Hospital, the Municipal Arts Society, and on the boards of Vera Institute of Justice’s Reform Leadership Council, the September 11th Memorial Foundation and the WTC Performing Arts Center.  She received her undergraduate degree from Columbia University magna cum laude. She received her law degree from Northwestern University School of Law. She serves on the National Advisory Board for Public Service at Harvard University.  Julie has been recognized as a Women’s Campaign Fund Rising Star, Citizen Union’s Civic Leader, City and State’s “40 Under 40,” “Power 100 Women,” and “Top 25 Women in Public Service.” She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including Columbia University’s John Jay award and the League of Conservation Voters Public Service award. She has served as a frequent national commentator on law and politics and has appeared nationally on CNN, The Today Show, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and other outlets and previously hosted and co-produced a local NBC cable news show focused on politics and law.

She is the daughter of Dr. Lynne Richardson and Dr. Desmond Jordan, two minority physicians who trained at the historic Harlem Hospital.  Her father, Dr. Desmond A. Jordan, just passed this past November 2020. He is deeply missed.  Growing up Kristin (KRJ) was in and out of Lenox Terrace where her great aunt was an original tenant and where Kristin herself lives now. She attended the Calhoun School where she graduated cum laude with distinction in Social Studies, Spanish, Mathematics, Science, and Music. She then attended Brown University where she graduated class of 2009 as a double major in in Black Studies (“Africana”) and Literary Arts and was a commencement speaker for the Africana Studies department.  Kristin (KRJ) is a book printing poet, teaching artist, author, and activist in the Harlem community, where her mother is also from and lives, where her great aunt (as mentioned above) was from and lived, and where her grandparents (married at Abyssinia Baptist Church) lived – 3 generations of Harlem.  Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has published her own (and others) work by starting an independent publishing company called Pens Up Press, for literary activists generally, and Black and Latino activists in particular to publish and promote books for and about making a better world. Kristin’s first book titled Mules Fight Back: 40 Activist Poems and Stories is a poetic response to the famous Zora Neale Hurston reference that the Black woman is the “mule of the world,” and her most recent work, Water & Light: Choose Love Now, rooted in her personal experience with an abusive relationship is about a totality of things from personal, interpersonal, romantic, platonic, social, communal to national revolution. In addition to her own work and publishing, Kristin also coordinates the Uproar Poetry Group, an online Facebook platform for activist poets, and (until recently with the COVID pandemic) ran senior poems and senior current events workshops at A. Phillip Randolph Senior Center and Central Harlem Senior Center. She and her team continue to serve seniors and ALL Harlem residents with daily wellness checks and mutual aid.  As an activist Kristin has participated in the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street mass movements. She’s been a member of the ANSWER coalition (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), a supporter of Freedom Hall and Sister’s Uptown Bookstore in Harlem, and a member of AALUSC (African Ancestrial Lesbians United for Societal Change). In 2012 Kristin founded a cop watch team and has continued to this day to be an advocate for police accountability. She is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, a member of LT-ACT (Lenox Terrace Tenants Association), and the Social Justice Chair for United Methodist Women at Salem Church. Kristin is also a practicing Buddhist (Christian Buddhist) and member of Soka Gakkai International (SGI). Some opponents with ties to the establishment claim they have “never seen Kristin” because of her lack of ties to Harlem’s political machine, but anyone active in Harlem community service and anyone out in the streets with the protests last summer and for years before knows Kristin, KRJ, Kristin for Harlem.  As a teacher and a teaching artist KRJ has worked for a number of notable organizations including Directions For Our Youth and Girl Be Heard; and until recently was a literacy specialist at Harlem Boys & Girls Club. She was also the co-founder of Freedom Love Birthright a writing and community theatre youth program in the spirit of African and African-American ancestry that took place in 2019 in Central Harlem.  As a public speaker, panelist, and guest lecturer, Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has presented at Circle of Voices, the Kennedy Center, Hostos Community College, and Montclair State University. She has also been featured on a number of podcasts including Mind Over Melanin.  Kristin is passionate about social justice, and the history, politics, and culture(s) of all people generally and Black people in particular. Politically spiritually and personally she believes in serving people including but not limited to housing, environment, health, food, education, and criminal/policing justice. She is an optimist and an idealist who dreams about a truly equal and equitable world based on seeing whole people and the humanity in every person.

District 9 - Council Member - Democrat - Central Harlem, Morningside Heights, Upper West Side, East Harlem - Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) is a third-generation Harlemite who has known Harlem since she was four months old. She is the daughter of Dr. Lynne Richardson and Dr. Desmond Jordan, two minority physicians who trained at the historic Harlem Hospital.  Her father, Dr. Desmond A. Jordan, just passed this past November 2020. He is deeply missed.  Growing up Kristin (KRJ) was in and out of Lenox Terrace where her great aunt was an original tenant and where Kristin herself lives now. She attended the Calhoun School where she graduated cum laude with distinction in Social Studies, Spanish, Mathematics, Science, and Music. She then attended Brown University where she graduated class of 2009 as a double major in in Black Studies (“Africana”) and Literary Arts and was a commencement speaker for the Africana Studies department.  Kristin (KRJ) is a book printing poet, teaching artist, author, and activist in the Harlem community, where her mother is also from and lives, where her great aunt (as mentioned above) was from and lived, and where her grandparents (married at Abyssinia Baptist Church) lived – 3 generations of Harlem.  Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has published her own (and others) work by starting an independent publishing company called Pens Up Press, for literary activists generally, and Black and Latino activists in particular to publish and promote books for and about making a better world. Kristin’s first book titled Mules Fight Back: 40 Activist Poems and Stories is a poetic response to the famous Zora Neale Hurston reference that the Black woman is the “mule of the world,” and her most recent work, Water & Light: Choose Love Now, rooted in her personal experience with an abusive relationship is about a totality of things from personal, interpersonal, romantic, platonic, social, communal to national revolution. In addition to her own work and publishing, Kristin also coordinates the Uproar Poetry Group, an online Facebook platform for activist poets, and (until recently with the COVID pandemic) ran senior poems and senior current events workshops at A. Phillip Randolph Senior Center and Central Harlem Senior Center. She and her team continue to serve seniors and ALL Harlem residents with daily wellness checks and mutual aid.  As an activist Kristin has participated in the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street mass movements. She’s been a member of the ANSWER coalition (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), a supporter of Freedom Hall and Sister’s Uptown Bookstore in Harlem, and a member of AALUSC (African Ancestrial Lesbians United for Societal Change). In 2012 Kristin founded a cop watch team and has continued to this day to be an advocate for police accountability. She is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, a member of LT-ACT (Lenox Terrace Tenants Association), and the Social Justice Chair for United Methodist Women at Salem Church. Kristin is also a practicing Buddhist (Christian Buddhist) and member of Soka Gakkai International (SGI).

Last name: Brannan E-mail: AskJB@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/justin-brannan/ Notes: District 47 - Council Member - Democrat - Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach - Council Member Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a record salesman and early childhood educator. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism at Fordham, before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – traveling to over fifty countries across five continents.  While working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor Council Member Gentile and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Education where he helped oversee the expansion of Universal Pre-K.  A longtime believer in the importance of making government work efficiently to create opportunities for working and middle class families, Brannan was elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn’s 43rd Council District. With too many people feeling that government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Council Member Brannan has vowed to always fight for the “little guy.”  The 43rd Council District might be far from the soaring skyscrapers and posh penthouses that many associate with New York City, but Brannan knows that his district is the backbone of the City and deserves the same respect, resources and results as everyone else. As Council Member, he’s made it his mission to make life just a little bit easier for everyone who calls the 43rd District their home.  Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his wife Leigh, an artist, educator, and small business owner.

Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.  As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.  For many years, Gale Brewer has taught at CUNY and Barnard College.  Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College.

This bill would similarly permit consideration of height or weight by operators or providers of public accommodations. Covered entities under this law would have an affirmative defense that their actions based on a person’s height or weight were reasonably necessary for normal operations.

Introduction The proposed bill would prohibit City agencies from entering into or renewing any contract for more than $100,000 with a proposed contractor that does not certify as a material condition of such contract that the proposed contractor has searched its records and relevant history to determine whether it or any predecessor or affiliated company ever engaged in or profited from the trade or use of enslaved people.

Referred to Comm by Council Action details Not available Int 0215-2022 * Charles Barron ~SPONSOR General Welfare Social services for the wrongfully convicted. Introduction As of October 2017, 2,110 individuals nationwide have been exonerated and released from prison. More than 10 percent of exonerations have come from New York State. Those New Yorkers spent an average of 9.18 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services.  This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.

Introduction This bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person’s height or weight in employment, housing, and public accommodations. This bill would also create an exemption for employers needing to consider height or weight in employment decisions only where required by federal, state, or local laws or regulations or where the Commission on Human Rights permits such considerations because height or weight may prevent a person from performing essential requirements of a job and no alternative is available or this criteria is reasonably necessary for the normal operation of the business. This bill would similarly permit consideration of height or weight by operators or providers of public accommodations. Covered entities under this law would have an affirmative defense that their actions based on a person’s height or weight were reasonably necessary for normal operations.

Introduction This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Operations to report on the exits from City-administered facilities, defined to include Department of Youth and Community Development, Department of Homeless Services, Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Human Resources Administration facilities. The report would be broken down by type of exit—supportive housing, City-financed homeless set-aside units, other affordable housing (defined as 421-a housing, Housing New York housing, City Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and New York City Housing Authority public housing and other housing), private rental market apartments with and without a rental subsidy, transitional housing, made own arrangements, or other.

Introduction Local Law 37 of 2011 requires a monthly report on emergency housing assistance usage. This bill would require that report to be updated to include information on the total number of all individuals utilizing emergency housing in the City and the total number of families with children, adult families, single men, and single women utilizing temporary emergency housing. The bill would additionally require the Mayor’s Office of Operations to report on the exits from various City-administered facilities, including Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), Department of Homeless Services (DHS), Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and Human Resources Administration (HRA) facilities.

Introduction The proposed bill would prohibit City agencies from entering into or renewing any contract for more than $100,000 with a proposed contractor that does not certify as a material condition of such contract that the proposed contractor has searched its records and relevant history to determine whether it or any predecessor or affiliated company ever engaged in or profited from the trade or use of enslaved people. The certification would include a statement of the results of such search. If the proposed contractor determines that it or its predecessor or affiliated companies engaged in or profited from slavery, then the proposed contractor must also provide a statement detailing the nature and extent of such engagement or profit, including relevant historical and other documentation. Referred to Comm by Council Action details Not available Int 0215-2022 * Charles Barron ~SPONSOR General Welfare Social services for the wrongfully convicted. Introduction As of October 2017, 2,110 individuals nationwide have been exonerated and released from prison. More than 10 percent of exonerations have come from New York State. Those New Yorkers spent an average of 9.18 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services.  This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.

The bill would also require the department, in situations where the actual rent of a household receiving a rental assistance voucher is less than the maximum rental allowance for that household, to reduce the tenant’s contribution by the difference between the maximum rental allowance and the actual rent, up to the amount of the utility allowance. If such a reduction is greater than the household rent contribution, the department would be required to issue a check to the household in the amount of such excess, within the month in which such excess is accrued.

Introduction This bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person’s height or weight in employment, housing, and public accommodations. This bill would also create an exemption for employers needing to consider height or weight in employment decisions only where required by federal, state, or local laws or regulations or where the Commission on Human Rights permits such considerations because height or weight may prevent a person from performing essential requirements of a job and no alternative is available or this criteria is reasonably necessary for the normal operation of the business. This bill would similarly permit consideration of height or weight by operators or providers of public accommodations. Covered entities under this law would have an affirmative defense that their actions based on a person’s height or weight were reasonably necessary for normal operations.

The bill would additionally require the Mayor’s Office of Operations to report on the exits from various City-administered facilities, including Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), Department of Homeless Services (DHS), Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and Human Resources Administration (HRA) facilities.

Introduction The proposed bill would prohibit City agencies from entering into or renewing any contract for more than $100,000 with a proposed contractor that does not certify as a material condition of such contract that the proposed contractor has searched its records and relevant history to determine whether it or any predecessor or affiliated company ever engaged in or profited from the trade or use of enslaved people.

Referred to Comm by Council  Action details Not available Not available Int 0215-2022 * Charles Barron ~SPONSOR General Welfare Social services for the wrongfully convicted. Introduction As of October 2017, 2,110 individuals nationwide have been exonerated and released from prison. More than 10 percent of exonerations have come from New York State. Those New Yorkers spent an average of 9.18 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services.  This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.

Last name: Moya E-mail: Fmoya@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-21/ Notes: District  21 - Council Member - Democrat - East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona in Queens, including Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Lefrak City and LaGuardia Airport - Francisco Moya currently represents the 21st Council District- encompassing East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and his native Corona.  Prior to his 2017 election to the Council, Moya was elected to the 39th Assembly District in 2010, making him the first Ecuadorian-American elected to public office in the United States.  A lifelong resident of Corona, Queens, Francisco began organizing in his community at the age of 15, when he and a group of concerned neighbors started the Corona Gardens Neighborhood Association, organizing members of the community and working to improve quality of life. Francisco went on to graduate from St. John’s University. He graduated with an MPA from Baruch College’s Urban Fellow program. Subsequently worked for two members of Congress, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Brad Sherman, in Washington, D.C.  In 2003, Francisco was named Secretary to the Senate for Senate Minority Leader David A. Paterson, and became the highest-ranking Latino in state government.  Throughout his years in the Assembly, Francisco has been a champion for working-class families, fighting to pass legislation that would preserve union rights, improve workplace safety and strengthen worker protections. He successfully passed legislation to stop employment agencies from robbing low-income families of hundreds in unfulfilled finder’s fees.  Francisco shined a spotlight on the epidemic of construction deaths that claimed as many as 33 lives — typically low-income workers of color — in just two years. He wrote Carlos’ Law and repeatedly blocked efforts to repeal the Scaffold Law in efforts to provide workers with the basic protections they need and deserve.  Council Member Moya continues to be a leader in the fight against hate-crimes and anti-immigrant policies on the national stage, introducing an omnibus bill – the New York State Liberty Act – to establish protections for undocumented immigrants that have long contributed to the culture and economy of New York and his district. As a leader in the fight to expand college opportunities for the children of undocumented immigrants, he wrote the DREAM Act, which was signed into law in 2019.  He also passed “curbstoning” legislation that allows the NYPD to tow for-sale cars that take up public street parking and are often uninspected and unsafe and as Chair of the Commission on Science and Technology, he worked to foster public-private relationships to bring STEM curriculum into the classroom and train students with skills that will prepare them for the industries of tomorrow.   As a community organizer, Assemblyman and now a City Council Member, Moya has been a stalwart champion for working-class and immigrant families and continuously fought to improve the quality of life for his community.

Last name: De La Rosa E-mail: District10@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/carmen-de-la-rosa/ Notes: District 10 - Council Member - Democrat - Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill - Carmen De La Rosa immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood where she has lived her entire life. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government.  In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent her community as the State Assembly Member of the 72nd District. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice.  As a progressive Democrat, Carmen has fought for criminal justice reform, workers’ rights, truly affordable housing and protections for tenants, climate justice, taxing the wealthy, LGBTIA rights, and many other consequential social justice policies.  She successfully negotiated and passed the New York State DREAM ACT and the first in the nation Excluded Workers Fund (EWF) at $2.1 Billion. As the member of the Assembly representing the district with the highest number of rent-stabilized apartments, Carmen actively participated in passing the strongest tenant protection laws in a generation.  On June 22nd, 2021, Carmen was victorious in the Democratic primary and subsequently won the general election on November 2nd, becoming the first Dominican woman elected to represent District 10 at City Hall.  Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses.  Carmen De La Rosa is committed to building a community-driven government rooted in the principles of co-governance and participatory democracy. Working alongside the community she is committed to improving the lives of residents in the community.  Carmen is proudly Mia’s Mom and along with her husband Jose, they are raising their daughter in the community where her parents also reside. As a proud product of uptown, Carmen looks forward to continuing to serve the community she loves and the community that helped raise her.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother. For nearly a decade, Sandy has been working in Bushwick and supporting projects in East New York that empower women and young people of color. Most of her work has been dedicated to ending white supremacy, fighting for a transition away from the fossil fuel economy, and demanding our public agencies and servants are accountable to the people, not corporations.  Through years of strong community partnerships and collaborations, Sandy has built neighborhood institutions that directly strengthen grassroots movements in Bushwick and East New York.

Shekar co-founded Communities Resist, a legal services organization highly acclaimed citywide for its community-rooted, intersectional approach to housing and racial justice in North Brooklyn and Queens. He represented tenants and neighborhood coalitions in fair housing litigation and anti-displacement advocacy in some of the most gentrified neighborhoods in NYC. Shekar began his legal career with the landmark Broadway Triangle fair housing struggle against the City of New York, a successful case challenging a rezoning under the Fair Housing Act. He also co-founded Friends of Diversity Plaza. Located on the border of Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, Diversity Plaza has become a national symbol of how public space can bring people together.  Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two small children, who can often be seen biking or scooting up and down the open 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

As a dedicated single teen mother, she works hard to create a sustainable future for her child and for all children and families who live in under-resourced neighborhoods.  Althea began her career in civic service more than 15 years ago working for non-profit agencies and community centers that focused on giving a voice to the most vulnerable populations. She organized voting rights information sessions, led strategy workshops to address gang policing and created annual youth forums and community celebrations to bridge relationships between residents and neighborhood partners. Each step of the way, Althea’s natural leadership and organizing skills were honed while advocating for families, seniors, young adults and students on important issues, while identifying and allocating much needed resources to neighborhoods of the Bronx.  Althea will continue her life’s work – of motivating and inspiring, leading with passion and advocating for the community – as a proud member of the City Council representing the great residents of City Council District 16.

As the daughter of Puerto Rican parents who moved here in the 1970’s to build a better life, she learned the values of hard work, dedication and commitment to education at a young age. Marjorie’s roots in the community were formed during her early years attending Public schools in Parkchester and St. Catharine’s Academy for high school in Pelham Parkway before earning her degree in Finance and Accounting at NYU. She worked in several corporate finance, budgeting, and accounting positions, where she designed and implemented accounting strategies for various regions around the world.  In 2012, Marjorie suffered life-changing injuries from a workplace accident and a subsequent serious car crash that left her temporarily disabled. Always a fighter, she found a path to recovery through giving back to her community. During her recovery, Marjorie’s life went from one of painful struggle to one of public service. Marjorie volunteered her time to elect several elected officials through historic and decisive wins. She also joined Bronx Community Board 10 where she served as treasurer and Municipal Services Committee chair, which focused on providing a much-needed voice to the community on issues ranging from transportation to parks services and other quality of life issues.  On the Community Board, she fought for budget equity for the community, open public spaces, and responsible business practices and against overdevelopment. Marjorie has also focused her time on the community board to help empower and promote advocacy on important issues of racial and gender equality, public safety and funding communities.  Marjorie also served as a volunteer on the boards of Amplify Her and the Broad Room, both of which are dedicated to empowering women through civil and political engagement. She also served on the board of St. Joseph’s School for the Deaf Children’s Fund, the Bronx- Westchester advisory board of Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and the Bronx River Alliance that advocates for environmental justice and resiliency.  Marjorie lives in Throggs Neck with her husband, Jeff, and their three rescue cats, Mercutio, Mio, and Savannah Grace.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.  Lincoln grew up in Brooklyn Heights and lives in Greenpoint with his partner. He graduated from Brown University and attended neighborhood schools.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is a steadfast advocate for truly affordable housing, worker rights, universal access to after school programs, and environmental sustainability.  Prior to his election, Council Member Abreu worked for the New York Legal Assistance Group, the National Labor Review Board, and the Natural Resource Defense Council. He holds a B.A. from Columbia University and a J.D. from Tulane Law School.

Last name: Hanif E-mail: District39@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/ Notes: District 39 - Council Member - Democrat - Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Waterfront, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington - Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.  Shahana attended PS 230 in Kensington and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies at Brooklyn College. She lives in Kensington with her cat, Babe.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education.

Nantasha M.  Last name: Last name: Williams Williams E-mail: E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

Mercedes’ commitment to family and community is based on a strong set of values passed on to her by her immigrant parents. Uniquely qualified and specially prepared, Mercedes has sought to bring all people – regardless of class, racial background, economic status, sexual orientation or social position into what she calls “the Family of People.”  As an advocate for her community, Mercedes has tirelessly worked to empower her neighborhood holistically. In order to excel on all levels, Mercedes works to support all families in our community, helping them understand how local government can work for them, and what they can do together to improve the quality of lives of all.  For decades, much of Mercedes focus has been connecting with different groups of young people, encouraging them to get involves by giving back to her community as young leaders in various aspects. Most recently she has partnered with young people at marches for social justice, census outreach, and food and facemask giveaways during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, Mercedes has fiercely worked to improve the quality of healthcare and its delivery, not only in Brooklyn, but overseas as well. Most recently, Mercedes is worked as a re-entry nurse at Paul J. Cooper Center for Human Services, Inc. where she provides, and addresses outpatient chemical dependency treatment for adult alcohol & drug abusers. She has also served as the general administrator of two different private clinics, MJC & Brooklyn Gastro.  Mercedes is a consensus builder and has worked and partnered with a number of local elected leaders to bring much-needed resources to the district. Mercedes well-rounded personality lends itself to community leadership, and public service.  Mercedes Narcisse has been recognized and honored by many organizations and associations for her long record and history of outstanding community service. In 2008, she was the sole recipient of the “Corporate Award” presented by the New York State Association of Black & Puerto Rican Legislators, Inc. This award recognized her vast contributions to the growth and development of minority and women-owned businesses in New York State. Mercedes has demonstrated that a focused combination of hard-work, honesty, integrity and a sense of community buy-in is the formula for achieving success.  On November 2, 2021, Mercedes was victorious in the General Election and is now the Council Member for the 46th Council District in Brooklyn.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

Last name: Bottcher E-mail: District3@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/erik-bottcher/ Notes: District 3 - Council Member  - Democrat ~ Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Greenwich Village, West SoHo, Hudson Square, Times Square, Garment District, Flatiron, Upper West Side - Erik Bottcher is a dedicated public servant and activist who has devoted his life to progressive causes and to the betterment of the community he loves. In 2021, he was elected to represent City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Flatiron, Hudson Square, Times Square, the Theater District, the Garment District and Columbus Circle.  Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality.  Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaision in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage.  In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Erik has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more.  When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik built an expansive volunteer network in his community that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors, and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments, and organized weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.  Erik believes that our government should be effective, innovative, inclusive, and that it must work for the people, not special interests. Erik knows that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

Gennaro is a Democratic member of the New York City Council, where he represents the 24th Council District and chairs the Council’s Committee on Environmental Protection, Resiliency & Waterfronts. Gennaro served his first terms from 2002 to 2013.  Although most closely associated with nationally-acclaimed environmental lawmaking, Gennaro authored more than 50 laws covering many issues, including increasing protections for women against domestic violence, protecting consumers from unscrupulous bankruptcy counselors, and in 2013, he authored and passed a law that raises the age of sale of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21, known as the “Tobacco 21” law, the first-in-the-nation law of its kind. In 2020, Tobacco 21 was adopted as national policy. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine states that the Tobacco 21 movement has saved “countless lives” across the United States.  Since his return to the City Council in 2021, Gennaro has continued to be the guiding hand of environmental policy in New York City. The main focus of his work has been on holding the city accountable to its stated emissions goals and pushing for greater storm resiliency in the face of more frequent superstorms. He has also been one of the strongest voices on the council calling on the state to institute a dangerousness standard for the courts in order to stem the rising tide of crimes the city is facing.

Last name: Ayala E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence. She is a partner with the people, and a strong voice and aggressive champion for what she believes in.  Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Last name: Riley E-mail: District12@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-12/ Notes: District 12 - Council Member - Democrat  - Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Co-op City - New York City - Kevin Christopher Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York.  While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal.  Prior to being elected to represent the New York City Council’s 12th district, Kevin worked for the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Carl E. Heastie.  For over a decade, he worked directly with community groups and organizations as well as pertinent leaders across New York City. This is where his passion was born, this is where he gained the courage to run for City Council.  Kevin has been no stranger to hard work or mentorship. Not only has he had mentors throughout his career, he has also dedicated his down time to generating positive relationships with the youth. Working for the New York Foundling as a Skills Coach is where he witnessed how much mentorship can impact your growth and overall confidence. As a skills coach, he mentored young men, educating them on life skills and making them cognizant of their social surroundings. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s, My Brother’s Keeper initiative.  In 2019, he founded a non-profit organization, Music Over Violence, which seeks to address violence and social injustice within his community. Another endeavor undertaken by Kevin, in conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers, is the founding of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives.  As the father of two beautiful daughters, Kevin C. Riley is a leader who is committed to making his community better for future generations. Councilman Riley currently represents the 12th City Council District covering the areas of Wakefield, Baychester, Eastchester, Olinville, Co-op City, Edenwald, and Williamsbridge in the Northeast section of the Bronx.

The Exonerated Five spent between seven to 13 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit, until their sentences were overturned in 2002. Since then, they have received a multi-million dollar settlement from the city of New York for its injustice and have been profiled in award-winning films, including The Central Park Five documentary from Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon and most recently the Emmy award-winning Netflix limited series When They See Us, written and directed by Ava DuVernay.  Over the past two decades, Yusef has become a family man, father, poet, activist and inspirational speaker. He continues to utilize his platform to share his story with others and educate the public about the impact of mass incarceration and police brutality rooted in our justice system. He regularly advocates for criminal justice reform, prison reform and the abolition of juvenile solitary confinement and capital punishment.  Yusef was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (2014) and is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama (2016). More recently has shared his story and stance on current issues on CNN, MSNBC, REVOLT TV, NPR Atlanta, FOX and more. He authored his memoir Better, Not Bitter and is the co-author of Punching the Air.

For more than a decade, she has worked for the well-being of working families, women, seniors, and the youth of New York City Council District 41. Her passion for the people of her district is displayed through her focus on legislation that reflects core community values which include: equality, fairness and non-discrimination in the workplace.  Local Law 33 of 2015, authored by Council Member Mealy, entrusted the NYC Commission on Human Rights with pursuing employment discrimination investigations. This law ensured that constituents seeking jobs across the city truly have a fair shot during the job application process. In conjunction with Local Law 33, Mealy also authored Local Law 29 of 2015, which ensures that the Commission on Human Rights regularly reports its work combating unlawful discriminatory practices.  As the former Chair of the Committee on Contracts, Mealy used her power over the City’s annual multi-billion dollar contracting budget to lift up Minority and Women-owned Businesses (MWBEs). She contributed to the passing of Local Law 1 of 2013, a pivotal MWBE legislation that helped underpin the MWBE program that the city still offers today. Her leadership has been prominent in later New York State and City Council legislation that adjusted procurement rules to allow for MWBEs to have real pathways to secure government contracts. Focusing on the challenges MWBEs has face ensures that small businesses across New York City, and in District 41, realize opportunities to secure the stability and growth that a city contract secures.  Using her expertise in navigating the city’s departments, Council Member Mealy secured a roster of results for her community. From Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of Buildings to the Department for the Aging and the Department of Youth and Community Development, Mealy has worked directly with the alphabet soup of City agencies that make decisions that impact daily lives of local constituents. The number of community resources that include the placements of senior programs, community workshops, funding for community-based organizations have all benefitted from her guidance and experience.  Council Member Mealy is truly BACK and BETTER THAN EVER.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Employers whose business operates online or through a mobile application would also be required to post the workers’ bill of rights online or on such mobile application. MOIA, in coordination with DCWP and community and labor groups, would be required to conduct outreach to workers in the City to raise awareness of the workers’ bill of rights. Such outreach would also include contact information for the City’s Immigration Legal Hotline and Asylum Application Help Center, resources and contact information for immigration legal services and MOIA, information on what to expect if immigration enforcement authorities come to an individual’s workplace, and information regarding federal eligibility requirements of Temporary Protected Status following designations, extensions, and re-designations of such status.

Participatory Budgeting (PB) is grassroots democracy in action. Participatory Budgeting was first implemented in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1989 by the socialist Workers’ Party. The political party sought to bring its decentralized and democratic party into government, and thus, PB was born. Rather than budget details being decided in secret behind closed doors, PB allows everyday people to engage with their government and decide how their public dollars are spent. In New York City, our city government sets aside a portion of the budget that individual Council Members can decide to use for PB. Every day people in those districts can submit ideas for projects they’d like to see, vote on their favorites, and ensure their priorities get funded by their public dollars. Cities worldwide (from Barcelona to Seoul) engage in this form of direct democracy and budget justice, where government and people work together to allocate resources to community needs. PB started in NYC right here in the 39th District as one of the first neighborhoods in the United States to engage in this form of direct democracy. Participatory Budgeting is also personal for Council Member Shahana Hanif, who led PB while working as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement for the 39th. Council Member Hanif knows that PB is an important pathway to leadership for young people and communities historically excluded from governing. This year marks the 14th Cycle of Participatory Budgeting in District 39!
