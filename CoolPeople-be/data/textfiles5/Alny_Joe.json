This is about one year earlier than the idea of a professor from Harvard University who suggested building an economic unity, called “Chimerica.” (Now I give up this idea of building a \"United China\" to replace the People's Republic of China, but separate China into 10 or 40 countries. This is also a good way for Chinese people to learn about the top civilizations of this world.) * In 2007, when I studied the MPA program at Troy University, AL, I suggested building a political unity, called “Amechina”, to unite America and China into one nation.

This is also a good way for Chinese people to learn about the top civilizations of this world.) “Amechina” is a Chinese style of respecting America more, but in the American way, it should be “Chimerica.” However, the Chinese think “Chimerica” is considered to respect China more. So “Chimerica” may be accepted by both sides, but it means different. it is tricky, Haha. Ask an American interpreter, she/he will agree and smile. But the problem is the interpreter is not a diplomat. An American diplomat is not a Chinese interpreter. When communist China is not a big issue it may not seem important too much, however, when communism becomes the biggest threat to our country and this world, an American politician who knows Chinese communism seems very important. That’s why I seek to serve our nation. We don’t have too much time. Waiting just means more and more costs in the future. If President Biden said he wouldn’t leave “withdraw from Afghanistan to another president,” why not say he won’t leave defeated Communist to another president? Yes, he can. He just doesn’t know communists very well and can’t find the most efficient way to beat them. “Amechina” is a Chinese style of respecting America more, but in the American way, it should be “Chimerica.” However, the Chinese think “Chimerica” is considered to respect China more.
