He claims to be the great-grandson of Jamaican political activist Marcus Garvey . As an aspiring rapper, Stora performs under the moniker Designer Attitude. He was also a regular hopeful for public office in New York. Stora is Joan Taylor ‘s son. Here are 13 more things about her; In 2005, while he was living in a homeless shelter that FJC Security secures, Marcus Serrano climbed the fence of the shelter and shot him. He sued FJC Security, the shelter operator Volunteers of America and the Department of Homeless Services over injuries he sustained when Serrano shot him in 2005. On November 3, 2014, the case was ruled in favor of the defendants, finding them not liable for negligence. After living in an apartment in Brooklyn with his then girlfriend Tina London and her four minor children, he filed protection orders against her and her adult son Kenneth London , which the Kings County Criminal Court issued on April 27, 2015. On May 10, 2015, he talked to New York Police Department detective Carl McLaughlin by phone and informed the detective that Tina and Kenneth violated his order of protection against them. McLaughlin advised him that Tina had been arrested following his complaint. On May 11, 2015, he appeared at Kings County Criminal Court to inquire into the status of Tina’s arraignment. The clerk informed him that there was no record of arrest so he called the NYPD’s 67th precinct and informed a lieutenant that McLaughlin incorrectly informed him that Tina was arrested. On May 12, 2015, McLaughlin called him, requesting that he come into the NYPD’s 67th precinct to identify Tina and Kenneth before they could be arrested. He went there and was arrested by McLaughlin for burglary based upon Tina’s and Kenneth’s reports. On May 15, 2015, he went to Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn for follow-up on a previous nose facture. On August 15, 2016, he filed a complaint accusing McLaughlin of excessive use of force, false arrest and malicious prosecution, another NYPD officer of failure to intervene and the city of New York of various constitutional violations. He later conceded that he did not have a valid cause of action against the city and the other NYPD officer, leaving McLaughlin as the sole defendant. On April 18, 2019, McLaughlin was found guilty of the excessive use of force and false arrest. In 2021, he was a candidate for mayor of New York City, running under the Out Lawbreaker Party ticket. On June 27, 2022, he nominated himself as a candidate of the Freedom Party for New York governor but his nomination was ruled invalid at the New York State Board of Elections Commissioners’ meeting. On June 29, 2022, he filed a petition, which was dismissed on August 4, 2022. On September 20, 2023, he allegedly attacked a boy, then 17, in the neck in Brooklyn. On October 26, 2023, he allegedly attacked a teacher, then 37, in New York City. He ran for election to the New York City Council to represent District 9 but he was disqualified from the general election scheduled on November 7, 2023. On November 18, 2023, he allegedly chased a man and a woman into a building in New York City while yelling, “I am going to kill you.” On December 7, 2023, he was arrested for three previous assault incidents. On March 25, 2024, he was arrested after allegedly hitting a woman, then 25. He was 40 years old when he was charged on March 27, 2024 with assault. On April 3, 2024, he will appear in court.
