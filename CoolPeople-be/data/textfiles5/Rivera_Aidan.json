    "text": "Home Music Bio Contact AidanNation AidanNation AidanNation Home Music Bio Contact Bio Bio Multi-talented American Pop / RnB artist AidanNation has 1 of 2 goals with his music, “to tug on your heartstrings with raw / real lyrics or to make you dance your @$$ off!” Growing up dancing in hip hop studios, AidanNation was no stranger to the stage from a young age, but it wasn’t until his late teenage years that he discovered he had a voice and a strong ear for harmony which led him to explore his talents in singing and songwriting. AidanNation’s childhood home was filled with RnB and much of his early influences come from artists such as Justin Timberlake, Usher and legends such as Prince, George Michael, Earth Wind & Fire, and Donny Hathaway. But don’t get it twisted, AidanNation is much more than just your average singer / songwriter and is one you must see live. On stage, AidanNation is electric as he lights up the stage with his intricate and powerful dance choreography and backup dancers in addition to his killer vocals, pulling inspiration and passion from his Puerto Rican and African American roots. Aidan is a powerful lyricist, empathetic and passionate about the music he writes and his ability to intimately connect with his audience is profound. AidanNation’s current focus is on releasing more of his original material and has nearly 10 new singles slated for release in 2024 and early 2025 across the 3 genres AidanNation loves – RnB, EDM, and Pop. One thing to note: regardless of the genre, AidanNation insists on instilling soul and emotion into his thick harmony-filled vocal arrangements and lyrics.
