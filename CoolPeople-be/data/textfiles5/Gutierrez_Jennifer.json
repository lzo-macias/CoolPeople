Tell us about yourself. Jennifer Gutiérrez is an organizer, activist, and ally. For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office? Everyone has a right to quality, affordable housing and I’ve worked tirelessly to make sure our community has a right to self determination, not leave planning up to real estate. The NYC education system supports over a million New Yorkers each day, and as a product of New York City public schools, I am committed to fighting for all public school students, providing them with all the resources they need to thrive I envision a City that prioritizes investments to social services over increased policing, eliminating the NYPD’s most harmful programs and practices. Everyone has a right to quality, affordable housing and I’ve worked tirelessly to make sure our community has a right to self determination, not leave planning up to real estate. The NYC education system supports over a million New Yorkers each day, and as a product of New York City public schools, I am committed to fighting for all public school students, providing them with all the resources they need to thrive I envision a City that prioritizes investments to social services over increased policing, eliminating the NYPD’s most harmful programs and practices. What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about? I believe that housing and healthcare are human rights, universal child care and afterschool are a given, open spaces are crucial, equitable educational opportunities, and a thoughtful and caring approach to justice across so many different avenues that our city instead funds a desperately ill-equipped PD to patrol. I am in this fight to see my community thrive and make sure the city I love works for all of its residents. I am running because the women of my community, who have been holding their neighbors up, encouraged me to do so. I am running because the experience of so many in my district is so similar to my own, and I want to fight for a better one. We need to address equity in our City, not just equality.
