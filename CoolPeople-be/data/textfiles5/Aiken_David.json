He was particularly associated with the works of Gian Carlo Menotti , and is best remembered for creating the role of King Melchior in the world premiere of Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors . Life and career [ edit ] [ edit ] Born in Benton, Illinois , Aiken studied English at Southern Illinois Normal College , where he matriculated in 1935. While a student there he was a member of the university's choir and studied singing privately with Grace Duty in Marion, Illinois . After earning his diploma in 1939, he briefly worked as a high school English teacher and track coach before accepting a post with the St. Louis Municipal Opera. He left that position in 1942 to join the United States Army Air Forces, where he was trained as a fighter pilot and commissioned as a second lieutenant. He spent the remainder of World War II flying the Consolidated B-24 Liberator for missions in both Germany and Italy. He remained a reserve officer and command pilot in the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel up through 1972.

After the show closed the following November, he and several of the other Broadway cast members took the show on tour for performances in Paris and London. He later returned to Broadway in March 1954 to create the role of Eddington in the original production of Sigmund Romberg 's The Girl in Pink Tights .
