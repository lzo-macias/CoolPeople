Research on memory had been rather predictable for many years until recently. It was predictable because the major advances for memory devices involved scaling down the physical dimensions of essentially the same device structure using basically the same materials. The situation has changed in the last two decades. Memory devices are beginning to be difficult to scale down. But perhaps the most important change is that new applications and products (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, enterprise-scale disk storage) in the last decade are often enabled by advances in memory technology, in particular solid-state non-volatile memories. are Our research on memory devices broadly covers phase change memory ( PCM ), metal oxide resistive switching memory ( RRAM ), ferroelectric memory and gain cell quasi-non-volatile memory. We aim to understand the fundamental physics of these devices and develop models of how they work. We explore the use of various materials and device structures (e.g. 3D vertical RRAM, amorphous oxide semiconductor for gain cell memory) to achieve desired characteristics.
