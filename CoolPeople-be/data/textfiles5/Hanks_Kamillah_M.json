    "text": "Staten Island's first Women in Business Expo. The Expo brought attention to women owned businesses on Staten Island and showcased over 60 vendors from local businesses. [ 10 ] [ ] During the Fiscal Year 2023 budget season, Hanks worked with fellow Staten Island City Council Members David Carr and Joe Borelli and City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams to secure $7 million in funding for the expansion of Richmond University Medical Center's NICU and PICU. [ 11 ] [ ] In 2024, Hanks opposed the City of Yes plan to increase housing supply in New York City. The plan proposed modest changes to zoning such as allowing owners of single-family homes and duplexes to add an extra unit on their lots, permit slightly more housing supply near transit stations, and ease the conversion of empty office buildings into housing. Hanks, who represents Staten Island which has produced very little housing in the last decade, said that any housing plan should \"maybe use a scalpel as opposed to a hammer.\" [ 12 ] [ ] References [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ a b \"District 49\" .
