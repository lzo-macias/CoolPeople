[ citation needed ] citation needed New York State Assembly [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1992, Stringer ran for and won Nadler's New York State Assembly seat representing the Upper West Side , when Nadler replaced deceased Congressman Ted Weiss . Stringer served for 13 years and six terms in the New York State Assembly , from 1992 until 2005. During his Assembly career, Stringer served as Chairman of the Cities Committee, Chairman of the Real Property Taxation Committee, and Chairman of the Oversight, Analysis and Investigation Committee. He led the fight to end empty seat voting and reform the State Assembly's rules of operation. He authored anti-stalking legislation and was an advocate of affordable housing , and good government reform. In 1999, Stringer was arrested at a police brutality protest outside 1 Police Plaza following the shooting of Amadou Diallo . [ 17 ] Later that year, Stringer organized a counter-rally to a Ku Klux Klan march. [ 17 ] [ ] [ ] On August 28, 2001, Village Voice political writer Wayne Barrett wrote a piece entitled, \"Mother Dearest & the Courthouse Cabal,\" in which he discussed Stringer's involvement in courtroom politics, specifically questioning how Stringer's parents had benefited financially from his political ties, and whether some of his campaign contributors had done unethical things. [ vague ] Barrett also raised questions about whether acting Supreme Court judge Louis York had attempted to gain Stringer's support in his bid for a full term on the court by appointing Stringer's mother nine times as a court evaluator and conservator. [ 18 ] In 2001, while a member of the Assembly, Stringer explored a run for New York City Public Advocate .

He took office as Borough President on January 1, 2006. Stringer issued over 40 policy reports designed to raise awareness about local issues and improve New York City. These reports have led the charge in addressing many of Manhattan's most important challenges and issues, including: increasing community input and response to development and planning projects across the borough; introducing comprehensive reform and empowerment measures to Manhattan's Community Boards; leading the fight to maintain [ 19 ] and create [ 20 ] new affordable housing units [ 21 ] and schools [ 22 ] across the borough; empowering [ 23 ] parents [ 24 ] to better participate in the public school system; investigating and recommending policy action on the city's many transportation issues; [ 25 ] and helping working families [ 26 ] and small businesses [ 27 ] access resources to become"

    "text": "and remain self-sufficient. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Food policy [ edit ] [ edit ] In November 2008 and December 2009 as Borough President, he hosted day-long conferences on the subject of progressive food policy . For the second conference, attended by 1,000 New Yorkers, he joined with New York University and the not-for-profit Just Food to address the impact of food on the health of New York City's people and their environment. He released several policy reports on food policy, including \"Food in the Public Interest\", [ 28 ] \"FoodStat\", [ 29 ] and \"Red Tape, Green Vegetables\". [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Bike lanes [ edit ] [ edit ] Throughout his tenure as Borough President, Stringer supported new transportation initiatives such as bike lanes. [ 31 ] After numerous constituent complaints, in 2010 he undertook a survey, \"Respect the Lane – Clear the Path\", a policy report analyzing bike lane safety in Manhattan. During the course of the three-day survey, a total of 1,700 infractions were witnessed. [ 32 ] The survey found that while bike lanes have a tremendous positive impact on New York City, the lanes were being misused by all parties; pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists. Working with community leaders, elected officials, local businesses, and local residents, Stringer worked to raise awareness about bike lane safety, and recommended an \"increase in protected bicycle lanes, which are separated from traffic by a physical barrier and stepped-up patrol by traffic enforcement agents to ticket scofflaws, along with better signage,\" among other ideas. [ 25 ] [ 31 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Hydraulic fracturing [ edit ] [ edit ] Stringer led the fight in New York City against hydraulic fracturing in New York State. [ 33 ] Stringer hosted many Manhattan Community Boards to discuss the potential problems associated with \"fracking\", such as contamination to the water supply. [ 33 ] Stringer also released a policy report in 2009, Uncalculated Risk: How Plans to Drill for Gas in Upstate New York could threaten New York City's Water System , a report highlighting the impacts of \"fracking\". [ 34 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 2009 re-election [ edit ] [ edit ] On November 6, 2008, Stringer announced his decision to seek re-election as Manhattan Borough President. [ 35 ] His Republican opponent, David Casavis, a history professor and foreign affairs writer/commentator, got 16% of the vote [ 36 ] on a platform to abolish the office. [ 37 ] In an October 5, 2009 article in City Limits , Stringer dismissed calls by Casavis and Mayor Michael Bloomberg to eliminate his office: \"There are people who are going to call for the elimination of the public advocate office, borough president, the City Council. There are people who believe that we should have a king system here,\" says Stringer. \"Borough presidents are part of a new era and a different kind of government. It has real responsibilities and it gives you a large footprint on the issues you get involved with. It's up to the individual to take advantage of that, that you might have an impact.\" [ 38 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] United States Senate consideration [ edit ] [ edit ] In Spring 2009, Stringer considered a primary challenge to incumbent U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand . [ 39 ] However, he announced in May 2009 that he would not run. In his statement he said: \"In light of President Obama's clear desire to avoid a Democratic primary in New York State, I have decided to focus on my re-election race for Manhattan Borough President and to suspend my exploratory committee and fund-raising efforts for the 2010 Senate race . I firmly believe that innovative thinking on issues like education and the urban environment must be joined with bedrock Democratic values on gun control and immigration if New York's interests are to be effectively represented in Washington.\" [ 40 ] [ ] [ ] New York City Comptroller [ edit ] [ edit ] 2013 election [ edit ] [ edit ] Stringer was the Democratic nominee for New York City Comptroller in the 2013 election . He defeated former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic primary. [ 41 ] [ ] Stringer was considered one of several contenders for the 2013 New York City"

[ 42 ] His campaign team included spokesperson Audrey Gelman , [ 43 ] advertising agency GMMB, [ 44 ] and pollster Mark Mellman . [ 45 ] Stringer was challenged by former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic party primary. [ 46 ] Stringer, originally thought to have the lead unopposed, trailed Spitzer in the polls until late August, when he took a two-point lead. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Stringer defeated Spitzer in the September 10 primary 52%–48%. [ 50 ] In the days prior to the Democratic primary, several media outlets published a piece describing Stringer's vote against legislation that stripped NAMBLA of its tax-exempt status. [ 51 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Tenure [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2014, Stringer criticized the health department's response to complaints about rats in New York City as \"weak\", because they failed in their oversight and their inability to follow their own procedures. [ 52 ] [ ] In November 2014, Comptroller Stringer announced an initiative, on behalf of the $160 billion New York City Pension Funds, to give long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own directors at 75 U.S. companies. [ 53 ] The \"proxy access\" initiative, known as the Boardroom Accountability Project, requests that these companies change their bylaws to allow shareholders who meet a threshold of owning three percent of a company for three or more years the right to list their director candidates, representing up to 25 percent of the board, on a given company's proxy. Proxy access is the ability for shareowners to nominate directors to run against a company's chosen slate of director candidates on the corporate ballot. The 75 proposals were filed based on three priority issues: climate change, board diversity and excessive CEO pay. Stringer called proxy access \"the defining issue for the 2015 proxy season\". [ 54 ] [ ] [ ] 2017 election [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2017, there was no Democratic primary for the position with Stringer defeating Republican Michel Faulkner in the general election. [ 55 ] [ ] New York City Mayoral Candidacy [ edit ] [ edit ] 2021 election [ edit ] [ edit ] On September 8, 2020, Stringer formally announced his candidacy for Mayor of New York City. He was endorsed by a number of progressive politicians shortly after his announcement, such as Jerry Nadler , Adriano Espaillat , Jamaal Bowman , Alessandra Biaggi , Julia Salazar , Yuh-Line Niou , Jessica Ramos , and others. At his announcement, he criticized incumbent mayor de Blasio saying: \"We never closed the book on a tale of two cities. If anything over the last eight years, we've written more chapters.\" [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Allegations of sexual misconduct [ edit ] [ edit ] In late April 2021, a woman, Jean Kim, accused Stringer of sexual misconduct when she volunteered on his 2001 Public Advocate campaign. Despite the loss of some supporters, and the retraction of endorsements from the Sunrise Movement , Working Families Party , Julia Salazar , Assemblywomen Catalina Cruz and Yuh-Lin Niou , Stringer maintained his bid in the mayoral race. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Following the accusations, Stringer lagged behind Andrew Yang and Eric Adams in the polls. [ ] [ ] A second woman accused him of sexual misconduct in June 2021. [ 61 ] In response, Stringer sued her for defamation. [ 62 ] [ ] [ ] Stringer finished in fifth place with 5.0% of the vote. [ 63 ] [ ] 2025 mayoral exploratory committee [ edit ] [ edit ] On January 18, 2024, Stringer announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to determine whether he should run for mayor in the 2025 New York City mayoral election . [ 4 ] Stringer officially launched his mayoral campaign in January 2025. [ 64 ] [ ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] On September 3, 2010, Stringer married Elyse Buxbaum, an arts administrator at the time, who is the deputy director of development at The Jewish Museum . [ 7 ] The couple chose to receive a marriage license"

    "text": "Meet Scott Scott Stringer has spent three decades fighting for New Yorkers. Born and raised in New York, Scott is a proven reformer who has always put people over politics and stood up for this city. Scott has a consistent track record of winning for New Yorkers: protecting Mitchell-Lama residents as a community organizer, ending corrupt practices in the State Assembly, championing affordable housing and accountable government as Manhattan Borough President, and exposing waste and saving taxpayers billions as Comptroller. “I've transformed every office I've held. I know where the problems are at City Hall, and I know exactly how to start fixing them. This isn't the moment for more empty promises, platitudes, or on-the-job training. New York needs someone ready to restore competent government from day one.” Now, as New York faces unprecedented challenges, Scott is ready to clean up City Hall and restore competent leadership from the moment he takes office. But for Scott, this isn't just politics, it's personal. He and his wife Elyse are raising their sons, Max and Miles, in the city they love. Like countless New Yorkers, he feels the weight of a city that’s not meeting the needs of its people. Every subway ride to school and every walk through their neighborhood reinforces the urgency to fix what’s broken. “As a father raising children in this city, I know firsthand the challenges families face, and I’ve watched the basic functioning of our city paralyzed by corruption and mismanagement. When schools aren't working, when public spaces feel unsafe, when housing is unaffordable, people leave. New Yorkers simply aren’t getting their end of the bargain.” New York doesn't need another showman, it needs a mayor who will do—and wants to do—the work our city needs. Someone who knows the city like the back of his hand and is focused on our most pressing issues, from cleaning up the trash on the streets, to restoring safety, to making sure government delivers for the people it’s meant to serve. That’s what Scott is all about. “This is a moment for real leadership, not backroom deals and drama. New Yorkers deserve a mayor who fights for them, not for his political survival and self-interest.” Scott's Track Record New York City Comptroller (2014–2021) Fiscal Accountability: Grew the city’s pension funds from $147 billion to $240 billion, achieving a cumulative 9.12% return—exceeding the portfolio benchmark and required actuarial rate of return (7%). Overhauled the back office of the City’s pension fund system—the fourth-largest institutional investor in the nation—and instituted new ethics, risk management, and compliance practices, banned “placement agents,” and aligned fees paid to investment advisors with their performance. Conducted rigorous audits of city agencies, including NYCHA, exposing inefficiencies and driving reforms to improve housing conditions. Identified and eliminated wasteful spending, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions while ensuring better service delivery. Housing Advocacy: Conducted 17 audits of NYCHA, identifying inefficiencies in lead paint remediation, boiler repairs, and tenant services, leading to tangible improvements. Focused on NYC’s affordable housing crisis by identifying over 1,000 vacant, city-owned lots that could be used to boost the City’s affordable housing stock by more than 50,000 units. Diversity and Transparency: Established the city’s first-ever Chief Diversity Officer, increasing the Comptroller’s office spending with minority- and women-owned businesses from 13% to 50%. Launched “Making the Grade,” the city’s first-ever review of MWBE access to procurement programs, exposing lack of equal access for minority firms and grading city departments' outreach efforts. Created transparency tools like ClaimStat and Checkbook NYC, shedding light on the city’s legal claims and contracts. Childcare and Education: Developed the NYC Under 3 initiative, the largest local investment in childcare proposed in the nation, making affordable childcare accessible to thousands of families. Published a report advocating for teacher residency programs to improve teacher retention and student outcomes. Small Business Support: Launched the \"Save Main Street\" initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing grants and resources to struggling small businesses. Conducted comprehensive engagement with small businesses, creating a blueprint for ensuring their survival and growth. Streamlined bureaucratic processes, such as permit applications, to make New York City more business-friendly. Public Safety and Justice: Created the award-winning ClaimStat initiative to track lawsuits against the city, identifying issues early and cutting claims by tens of millions of dollars. Added the NYPD to the city’s Checkbook database, providing real-time transparency of NYPD spending and contracts. Terminated the MOU that allowed the NYPD to shield surveillance and equipment purchases, increasing transparency around department spending. Climate Leadership: Led the largest divestment"

    "text": "from fossil fuels by a public pension fund, a $4 billion move, and doubled investments in renewable energy to $6 billion. Championed a Green New Deal for New York City, including plans to phase out fossil fuels, expand renewable energy projects, and create green jobs. Audits and Investigations to Reform Government: Conducted high-impact audits exposing waste and corruption, saving billions in taxpayer dollars. Led audits of NYCHA, uncovering systemic failures, mismanagement of $692 million in federal funds, and poor inventory practices, prompting critical reforms. Identified 1,100 vacant city-owned properties that could create 57,000 affordable housing units. Exposed health and safety hazards in city shelters, leading to major corrective actions by DHS. Uncovered $31 million in underreported US Open revenue, securing additional rent payments and lease renegotiations. Highlighted NYC’s early COVID response failures, driving improvements in crisis management. Manhattan Borough President (2006–2013) Education Initiatives: Launched \"School Overcrowding War Rooms,\" forcing the Department of Education to invest in new schools and reallocate resources to address overcrowding. Advocated for better public school funding and policies like universal pre-K to close the achievement gap across Manhattan’s public schools. Partnered with communities to secure $24 million in arts education funding, ensuring every child has access to creative resources. Facilitated the expansion of major universities, including Columbia, Fordham, NYU, and Cornell Tech, creating thousands of jobs while balancing community needs through innovative solutions like the West Harlem Special District. Affordable Housing: Opposed predatory real estate practices and supported community land trusts to protect tenants from displacement. Established the first-ever Urban Fellows Program, which placed an urban fellow to work in every community board to help ensure a stronger community voice in development and neighborhood planning. Initiated policies to preserve affordable housing units and promote equitable urban planning. Championed responsible rezoning initiatives that included affordability guarantees and protections for longtime residents. Estimated that New York City renters sunk approximately $507 million into security deposits alone, leading directly to landmark state legislation that now limits security deposits to one month’s rent and empowers tenants. Sustainability and Public Space: Led efforts to expand bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, and green spaces, promoting sustainable urban living. Advocated for energy efficiency and green building standards in Manhattan’s urban development projects. Helped lead the campaign against fracking in New York State and launched the Go Green East Harlem program, which opened the neighborhood’s first walk-in asthma center. Public Health and Safety: Supported initiatives to reduce asthma rates in high-risk neighborhoods through air quality improvement programs. Advocated for expanded hospital capacity and mental health services across the borough. Community-Based Planning: Strengthened and reformed community board systems, ensuring greater public input in land use and zoning decisions. Created the West Harlem Special District, a rezoning of the West Harlem neighborhood that helped protect its character and allowed tenants to stay in their homes while also ensuring that Columbia University could expand. New York State Assembly (1993–2005) Ethics and Transparency: An outspoken advocate for democratizing the legislature. Led efforts to pass the first ethics reforms in Albany in a generation—including the end of “empty seat voting,” the practice that for decades allowed lawmakers to vote on legislation without even being present in the Capitol. Advocated for increased government accountability and campaign finance reform to reduce corruption. Tenants' Rights: Bucked party leadership with bold votes against rent regulation roll-backs, including opposing vacancy decontrol, a pivotal moment in the fight to preserve affordable housing, ensuring rent-stabilized units remained available to low- and middle-income families. Went against his party to stop the repeal of the commuter tax to put New York City’s interests first. Supported legislation under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act to expand tenant protections and prevent evictions during housing crises. Landmark Legislation: Co-sponsored the state’s first marriage equality legislation and passed bills protecting survivors of domestic violence, including stronger restraining order enforcement and safe housing guarantees. Opposed the repeal of the commuter tax, defending NYC’s fiscal sustainability. Contact us: Press: Volunteer: Scheduling Requests: Stringer NYC, PO BOX 4413, New York, NY 10185"
