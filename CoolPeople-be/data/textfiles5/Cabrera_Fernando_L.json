A Democrat , he formerly represented the 14th district in the New York City Council , including the neighborhoods of Claremont Village, Fordham , Kingsbridge , Marble Hill , Morris Heights , Mount Eden, Mount Hope , and University Heights .

[ 1 ] [ ] Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] Cabrera was born in the Bronx to a Dominican father and Puerto Rican mother. He received a B.A. in Religion from Southern California College , a M.A. in Counseling from Liberty University , and a Doctorate in Education from Argosy University . [ 2 ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2009, Cabrera challenged Maria Baez to a primary election for the Democratic nomination for 14th district in the Bronx. With the backing of The Bronx Democratic Committee [ 3 ] and the endorsement of key unions, Cabrera was able to defeat the incumbent by just over 1% difference in three-way race that included Yudelka Tapia . [ 4 ] Cabrera followed that by winning the general election against Republican Yessenia A. Duran and Conservative Lisa Marie Campbell. [ 5 ] He won reelection in 2013. [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2014, Cabrera challenged Senator Gustavo Rivera in the Democratic primary, but lost 59% to 41%. During his primary bid against Rivera, Cabrera attracted ire for his opposition to abortion & gay marriage, as well as his apparent praise of an anti-gay Ugandan law. [ 6 ] In a video posted on Youtube and later deleted, Cabrera, speaking from Uganda, said, \"Gay marriage is not accepted in this country. Why? Because the Christians have assumed the place of decision-making for the nation.\" [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] Cabrera challenged Rivera again in 2016, [ 8 ] but lost by a larger margin, 63% to 37%. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] On September 12, 2017, Cabrera won 55% of the vote in the New York Democratic Primary election , to 35% for challenger Randy Abreu and 10% for Felix Perdomo. On January 11, 2018, Cabrera was elected Majority Whip and Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Operations. [ 10 ] [ ] In 2019, Cabrera announced that he was going to challenge Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district , while criticizing her embracing of democratic socialism . [ 11 ] On March 1, 2020, Cabrera announced that he was ending his primary bid against Ocasio-Cortez"
