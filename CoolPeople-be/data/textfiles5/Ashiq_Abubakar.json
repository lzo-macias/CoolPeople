    "text": "Home Policies The journey of Abubakar Ashiq from a teenage immigrant in Queens to a devoted public servant and prospective District Leader candidate is evidence of his fortitude, zeal for justice, and dedication to his neighborhood. After arriving in the United States from Pakistan at the age of 13, Abubakar immediately assimilated into Queens' variety and values, where hard work and education served as the pillars of his career and personal development. At the age of 20, Abubakar graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Human Rights. His commitment to promoting justice and equity and working to improve society is fueled by his education. Abubakar's dedication to service is demonstrated by his career path. He assists attorneys and clients in resolving legal issues in his capacity as a paralegal at the law firm. His legislative internship in District 105 with New York State Assembly Member Anil Beephan improved his advocacy, legislative research, and public policy abilities. Additionally, he has been an active volunteer for Brandon Castro's campaign for the District 30 New York State Assembly, where he engaged voters and promoted civic engagement. Now, Abubakar is now running for the District Leader of Woodside. He aspires to contribute forward to the community that influenced him. His track record in education, public service, and the workplace demonstrates his commitment to promoting fairness and opportunity for all. His conviction that everyone should have the opportunity to succeed is the foundation of his candidacy, and he is prepared to serve with a strong dedication to equity and justice."
