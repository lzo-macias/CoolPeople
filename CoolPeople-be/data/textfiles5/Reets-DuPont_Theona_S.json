Whose example would you like to follow, and why? I look up to my mother and father, who led with purpose, humility, and a deep commitment to serving others. Their example continues to inspire me. As a business leader and workersâ€™ rights activist, they fought tirelessly for the rights of working families and small business owners. Like my parents, I believe in the power of public service, in giving a voice to the unheard, and in fighting for justice, fairness, and dignity in our communities. I also draw inspiration from the countless community members, educators, and frontline workersâ€”people like myselfâ€”who may not be widely recognized, but who show up every day to make their neighborhoods stronger, safer, and more inclusive. Their resilience and quiet leadership are a constant reminder that real change begins at the ground level. I aim to follow the example of those who lead by listening, who stand up for working people, and who are unafraid to challenge the status quo to build something better. Thatâ€™s the kind of leader I strive to be rooted in community, driven by equity, and committed to action.

It was a time that reshaped how we understood safety, global politics, and our shared humanity.

My first job as an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher spanned seven incredible years, during which I had the opportunity to teach at a variety of settings, including community centers, colleges, and schools. This experience was not just a job but a journey that shaped my understanding of education, language, and the power of connection. Teaching in community centers was my introduction to ESL, and it was an eye-opening experience. Many of my students came from diverse backgrounds, with different educational histories and language skills. Some were immigrants seeking to improve their English for work or to integrate into their communities, while others were refugees rebuilding their lives. It was in this setting that I realized the importance of not just teaching language but also supporting my students in their emotional and social transitions. The community centers became more than just places to learnâ€”they were spaces for cultural exchange, personal growth, and empowerment. From there, I had the privilege of teaching in colleges, where I worked with older students who were often focused on improving their English to pursue further academic studies or career goals. These students were motivated and hardworking, and I loved helping them build the skills needed for success in higher education. Teaching in this environment allowed me to focus on academic writing, critical thinking, and advanced conversational skills. It was rewarding to see students improve their fluency and confidence, enabling them to tackle complex topics in English and succeed in their academic pursuits. I also taught in schools, where I worked with younger students. This was an entirely different experience, as I had to adjust my teaching methods to engage a younger audience and keep them motivated. The challenge of working with children was incredibly rewarding, as it often required creativity in making lessons both fun and educational.

Why? \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho. It's one of those books that inspires people to follow their dreams and trust their own journey, no matter how difficult the path may seem.

These relationships can be valuable when it comes to advocating for the community and securing resources or support for key initiatives. Policy Expertise Prior experience in government or politics often provides a deeper understanding of specific policy areas, such as budgeting, public safety, education, or housing. This expertise allows officials to make well-informed decisions and contribute to more comprehensive policy development.

The pastor told the congregation, \"Anyone who donates $1,000 can choose the next three hymns.\" An elderly woman immediately raised her hand and said, \"Iâ€™ll donate $1,000!\" The pastor asked, \"What three hymns would you like?\" The lady replied, \"Him, him, and him!\" What organizations or individuals have endorsed your campaign? At this time, I havenâ€™t received formal endorsements, but my campaign is powered by the peopleâ€”neighbors, community leaders, working families, and everyday Bronxites who believe in a future built on unity, equity, and action. As the campaign moves forward, I look forward to building meaningful partnerships with organizations and individuals who share that vision and are ready to work toward lasting change. What are your views on financial transparency and government accountability? Financial Transparency I believe that when public funds are spent, the community has a right to know how every dollar is used. Taxpayer money should be allocated in ways that directly benefit the people, and the process must be clear, accessible, and open to scrutiny. As your elected official, I will ensure budget decisions, spending plans, and financial reports are transparent, allowing you to see exactly where your money is going. This transparency builds trust and ensures that every decision made is for the public good. Government Accountability Government must be accountable to the people it serves. This means being open about decisions, responding to community concerns, and being responsible for actions and outcomes. I will hold myself and my office to the highest standard of accountability, making sure that I answer to you. If I make a promise, Iâ€™ll keep it, and if things go wrong, I will take responsibility and work to correct them. A government that listens, acts with integrity, and remains answerable to its citizens is one that truly serves its community.
