Paladino is a member of the New York City Council for the 19th district , a northeast Queens district that includes College Point , Whitestone , Bayside, Douglaston, Little Neck, and parts of Flushing. [ 1 ] A member of the Republican Party, she was first elected to the City Council in 2021 and was re-elected in 2023. In 2025, Paladino was named minority whip of the City Council. [ ] Political career [ edit ] [ edit ] Paladino gained media attention in 2017 after she confronted then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a public appearance. Paladino, who was on her way home from a nail salon, stopped to shout at de Blasio for having traveled to Germany to attend a protest a day after a New York City police officer had been shot to death. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Paladino ran for State Senate in 2018, but was defeated by Democrat John Liu . [ 3 ] [ ] In 2021, Paladino defeated Democrat Tony Avella to win election to the New York City Council. Her predecessor, Paul Vallone , was term-limited. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Paladino was re-elected to the City Council in 2023, defeating Avella in a rematch. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] On her first day at work as a member of the City Council, Paladino declined to provide proof that she had been vaccinated against COVID-19. After Paladino said, \"'I don’t need to show you my papers... This is not Nazi Germany'\", she was not allowed to enter the Council chamber. [ 3 ] Paladino later apologized for her remarks and participated in City Council proceedings online; [ 8 ] she was eventually granted a religious exemption from the vaccine mandate and was granted access to the Council chamber. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] During her time on the New York City Council, Paladino has been a critic of bicyclists in New York City. She has called for bicyclists to carry liability insurance , register their bikes and carry license plates . [ 9 ] [ ] In March 2023, Paladino was removed from the City Council's Mental Health Committee in what she claimed to be retaliation for her comments about Drag Queen Story Hour , a program in which drag performers read storybooks to children at schools and public libraries. Paladino referred to the program as \"'cultural indoctrination'\" and \"'child grooming'\". Paladino added, \"'Our kids are lagging in school... They are two and four years behind in basic education, math, reading, science, they need to get back to basics...and to concentrate our efforts on drag queens seems like a terrible waste of time and energy'\". [ 10 ] [ ] On May 3, 2024, in response to campus protests against Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip , Paladino called college students \"monsters\" who must be \"slayed\" in New York City.
