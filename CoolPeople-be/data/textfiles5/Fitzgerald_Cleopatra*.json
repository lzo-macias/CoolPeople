What is the method in international relations to resolve world issues and what are the global issues? First of all honesty, no hypocrisy, no bias, no discrimination, international dispute resolution strategies, intercultural communication, strategic peacebuilding, futuristic technology, do not disrespect, learn and remember cultural etiquette in order not to offend, persons should take aside differences and unite for the resolutions that the world greatly needs. Statistics or international rankings can be biased, misleading, data error, and more.

The country categories generally are: least developed, developing, developed. Thus, in view throughout eras the repeating issues are: Health (pandemic, diseases, etc), environment, education, poverty, human rights, crime, conflict, migration, corruption, economy, inequality, debt, refugees, deficit, misinformation, lack of collaboration, and further. Looking at global history it is easy to observe that these issues are constantly reappearing. Even though a new era will bring forward the futuristic technological, space, digital inventions the same notion can be applied.

By analyzing the causes of crimes worldwide it could be reduced significantly. Studying the zone where crimes occur -it can be due to poverty, white collar crime, lack of education, peer pressure, unreasonable laws, corrupt system, unreliable politicians, easy access to drugs, alcohol, upbringing, family, school bullying, cyberbullying, religion, unemployment, violence in media, neglect, hormones, hereditary, justice system and furthermore. Then, types of crimes and the severity of punishment can be analyzed to see how high technology reduces crime. Additionally, implement crime methods that can save lives and fairly bring perpetrators to justice. Do you believe in forgiveness? Under what circumstances or not? Forgiveness is virtuous when the forgiver decides not to clench to ill temper and bitterness but instead release any negative thinking towards the offender or person. Nonetheless, forgiveness in some cases is unethical depending on the context. If a person is forgiving criminals, thieves, rapists, cheaters, to name a few…such as when clemency, pardon is given -the issue will be if the offender is not remorseful and have not learned the consequences of their actions. The levels of forgiveness varies there are: unconditional, full, conditional, partial and others. Persons might change their lives around if forgiven. Worldwide religions cover this topic as well. A person can forgive and yet do not reconcile, forget or accept. It is based on a person’s beliefs, experiences, religion and other factors. I personally do not hold on to hate, I do not judge I analyze, I forgive my worst critics or haters and I hope they find the peace, wisdom, and decency to live righteously. You mentioned that life is not only a “melting pot, stained glass” but a kaleidoscope, please explain. Since nature contains patterns, symmetry, fractal geometry, cultural diversity in all colors, patterns are a cycle of continuance, regeneration, generations. Kaleidoscope as the magic of Earth and cosmos, the reflection of light and mirrors, light on Earth by the Sun and the space mirrors, telescopes utilized for space. Existence as viewed through a lens takes many forms of unity and dimensions, transformations. Nonetheless, various animals see dissimilar than humans for their intended circumstances that make them ideal for their environment such as night vision. A kaleidoscope can be black and white and the motions remain the same. Humans consist of the five senses and beyond. What are the top issues in the environment? There are an infinite number of environment issues that are classified into diverse subjects including: Pollution, waste, overpopulation and declining population in differing countries, energy, deforestation, desertification, depletion of resources, extinction, conservation, mining, health, genetics, engineering, farming, nanotechnology, environmental justice, ecotourism, geotourism, and countless other sources that can be found simply under Environmental issues. Each with their branches of unsolved complications. Space issues are part of environment and are of great consequence -here are a few: space junk (debris), space tourism, radiation, contamination, galactic wars, etc. Collectively, these are somewhat helped through donations, organizations, countries, patrons, banks, companies, charities, and so forth. It will take longer for countries that are not fully modernized to even keep up with the space era and technological advancements. If they are limited in resources they need the most concentration of aid. How can we resolve inflation to regain stability? There are several indexes to calculate the severity of inflation. Inflation can be influenced by wars, pandemics and factors that increase inflation. It is said that high inflation like bad deflation periods can become problematic. There are categorizations of inflation by rapidity: galloping, running, walking, creeping, hyperinflation. Causes of inflation are demonstrated in charts with terms like: “Core, Multicasual, Demand-Push, Cost-Push, Budgetary, Wage, Imported, suppressed, profit induced, etc.” Some ways to repair inflation are: Look at historical epochs and similar conditions that have improved inflation, new policies or revisions, fiscal policies, prices, money circulation and where it is being used, invest in non-wasteful programs and instead in where it matters, taxes, government spending, avoid unnecessary conflicts or deficits, innovation, global trading, borrowing, Federal Reserve, and so on.

It is rewarding because the global economy has comparative advantages. It depends on trade balance, specialization, harmonious trade partners, reasonable prices, GDP growth, help consumers and poverty zones with resources, brand recognition and possible stability, jobs, usefulness of foreign exchange,"
