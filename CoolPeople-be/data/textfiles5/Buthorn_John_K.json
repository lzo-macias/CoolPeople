For The People, For Our Future Donate To John's Campaign It seems like the world is increasingly chaotic, and our efforts to improve our personal and community security and family financial health feel more distant. Many of these things feel out of our control, and our voices are muted in the larger process. My name is John K. Buthorn, and I am running for NYC Council (District 51 - Staten Island) because I, too, am tired of feeling this way. Our district is a strong working class and values-driven community looking to attain a better quality of life for ourselves and our families. I am dedicated to doing my part to bring together the community and fight for the necessary changes in NYC law and fiscal policies that reduce our financial burden, improve our services needed for safety and emotional health, as well as support our small businesses to allow them to thrive without burdensome interference. I am very proud to have served our great country as a United States Marine during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). I am a retired sergeant with the New York Police Department (NYPD) who has served in various positions throughout my career, from investigative ranks to public relations to supervisory positions. After my NYPD career, I went back to college to attain a Master’s degree in Social Work and currently am a Licensed Master Social Worker serving as a psychotherapist. I believe my experience is unique. I hope this glimpse demonstrates how I will fight, problem-solve, and collaborate with any persons who will allow us to reach these objectives together. I also come from a working-class family, a father, and husband looking for those same goals to leave my children in a stronger community. And a better NYC.
