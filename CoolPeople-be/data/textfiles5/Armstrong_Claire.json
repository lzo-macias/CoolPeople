    "text": "(2009), The Confidence Code (2014), and The Confidence Code for Girls (2018). [ 6 ] [ ] In 2018, she attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference and conducted interviews on stage with US politicians Marco Rubio , Chris Coons , Tom Cotton , and Grace Meng . [ 13 ] [ ] Columbia University [ edit ] [ edit ] Shipman joined the board of trustees of Columbia University in 2013 and became a co-chair in 2023. [ 14 ] Her tenure's span included the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus occupations during which the NYPD entered the campus and arrested dozens of students for protesting against Columbia’s divestment in companies operating in Israel and for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. [ 15 ] [ ] [ ] Acting President [ edit ] [ edit ] On March 28, 2025, Shipman, then serving as co-chair of Columbia's board of trustees , was made acting president of the university amid turmoil from protests in solidarity with Palestine and crackdowns from the Trump administration, which had cut US$400 million in federal funding from Columbia. [ 16 ] She took over for interim president Katrina Armstrong, who stepped down suddenly after what the Trump administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Antisemitism called a \"concerning revelation\" earlier that week, [ 17 ] ostensibly a call with faculty in which she downplayed Columbia's commitment to its concessions to the Trump administration. [ 18 ] The announcement was made by her co-chair David Greenwald, who then became the sole chair of the board of trustees. [ 19 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Review of the University Senate [ edit ] [ edit ] Shortly after participating delivering her first address as acting president in her first meeting with the University Senate on April 4, [ 20 ] acting president Shipman announced on April 18 [ 21 ] that the University Senate —a policymaking body composed of faculty members and students established for shared governance after the 1968 Columbia University protests [ 22 ] [ 23 ] —would be subject to review. [ 24 ] According to The New York Times , the move is an \"effort to potentially diminish the university senate’s authority,\" and one that Shipman and the trustees have used \"vague language\" to explain. [ 25 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Mass arrest of student protesters in Butler Library [ edit ] [ edit ] After pro-Palestinian protesters occupied the main reading room at Butler Library on May 7, 2025, naming it the \"Basel Al-Araj Popular University\" for Bassel al-Araj , Shipman summoned the NYPD, and police in riot gear arrested 78 student protesters. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] It was the fourth mass arrest at Columbia University in 18 months [ 28 ] and the largest since April 2024 when the NYPD arrested 109 in its sweep of \"Hind's Hall\" and the second Gaza Solidarity Encampment. [ 29 ] The policing and suppression of the protest has been described as forceful and aggressive, [ 30 ] [ 31 ] with two individuals brought out in a stretcher, one of them wearing a kuffiyeh draped over their face. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The university Emergency Medical Service was denied entry by Public Safety to treat injured protestors. [ 34 ] Shipman praised the NYPD and Public Safety for what she called their \"professionalism.\" [ 35 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] She was married to former CNN Moscow bureau chief Steve Hurst from 1991 to 1996. [ 36 ] She was then married to former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , with whom she has a son and daughter. [ 37 ] As of 2025, they were recently divorced. [ 38 ] Shipman has stated that Carney gave her no indication that the secret operation that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden was under way in Pakistan.
