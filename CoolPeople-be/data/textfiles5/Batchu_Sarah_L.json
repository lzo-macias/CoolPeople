Rising rents, shuttered hospitals, and families pushed out of their homes—it’s time for change. Join the Movement Building a City that Cares Government used to care. It worked for us. But our leaders stopped solving problems and started putting personal gain over our needs. That’s why Sarah is running for City Council. It’s time for a New York that truly cares—a New York where healthcare is guaranteed, families aren’t drowning in childcare costs, and everyone has an affordable home in a safe neighborhood.​ Proudly Endorsed By Elected Officials Organizations Community Leaders Aishyalah Campbell , Former President, Haven Plaza Tenant Association Camino Lopez , Treasurer, NYCHA LES III Tenant Association Carmen Gonzalez , Former Board Member, Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association Charles Arnold , Co-President, Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats Charisse King , Vice President of Quality of Life, Three Bridges Democratic Club Chung Seto , President, United Democratic Organization Danielle Washington , Treasurer, MS/PS 54 Parent Teacher Association Danny Orlin , East Village Resident & Owner, Cafe Mogador Ed Brady , Greenwich Village Resident & Owner, the Comedy Shop Erika Sumner , Vice President, Washington Square Association Erma Campbell , Vice President, Haven Plaza Tenant Association Gio Chavarría , Local Small Business Owner & East Village Native Grauven Olivares , Board Member, Community Education Council 1 Jamie Felber , Local Small Business Owner & Former Community Board 3 Member Jasmin Sanchez , President, Three Bridges Democratic Club Jess Beck , Co-Founder, East Village Neighbors Who Care Joel Rodriguez , Lower East Side Native & Owner, Free Advice Barber Shop Kathleen Collins , Disability Advocate and Attorney Kathryn Konkle , Original Member of the 6BC Botanical Garden Magda Napoleon , District Leader, 65th Assembly District, Part B Mary Monroe , Secretary, NYCHA Lillian Wald Houses Tenant Association Melanie Aucello , President, 344 E 28th Street NYCHA Tenant Association Melissa Martinez , Member of Three Bridges Democratic Club Nat Esten , East Village Resident & Owner, Book Club Norma Nazario , Safety Advocate Ramya Guttikonda-Taylor , Chef, Small Business Owner, & Former East Village Resident Renee Kinsella , Vice President, 29th Street Block Association Ryder Kessler , Community Board 2 Member & Former State Assembly Candidate Sabina Brunetti , Local Public School Parent & Small Business Owner Sabura Rashid , President, NYCHA LES III Tenant Association Susan Finelli , Director, 29th Street Block Association Taquan Pugh , Local Community Organizer & Public School Teacher Tyler Hefferon , Executive Director, EV Loves Virginia Kee , Co-Founder of Chinese-American Planning Council 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 team@sarahbatchu.nyc team@sarahbatchu.nyc (‪347) 620-1238‬ (‪347) 620-1238‬ Facebook-f Facebook-f Twitter Twitter Linkedin-in Linkedin-in Instagram Instagram Paid For By Batchu For Council Loading Comments..."

    "text": "Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Volunteer Volunteer Meet Sarah Sarah is a public servant, nonprofit leader, and committed activist for better healthcare and housing. She’s running to transform New York City into a place where everyone can feel safe and cared for. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. As a student at Barnard College, Sarah’s commitment to service deepened even further as she responded to the movement around campus sexual assault. As a survivor, Sarah intimately understood the toll that a lack of safety could take on the mind and body. With the guidance of fellow survivors and community activists across the city, she transformed her own pain into an ongoing commitment to building a safer city for all—and has had a results-driven career in public service ever since. From the earliest days of her career in New York City government at City Hall, Sarah began tackling the big issues head-on—like addressing the city’s crumbling public housing infrastructure and planning an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In just a few short years, Sarah’s dedication and tenacity yielded remarkable, proven results for thousands of New Yorkers: Sarah raised millions to build innovative public programs serving New Yorkers from all walks of life, including women , immigrants , and people with disabilities . Sarah successfully advocated for reforms to increase access to safe and affordable housing for formerly justice-involved New Yorkers. Sarah designed, launched, and managed Get Help NYC, a groundbreaking online platform that became the city’s primary resource hub during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sarah worked directly with public housing residents to enshrine their rights into law and to give them a voice in the renovation of their homes. Sarah raised over $7 million in rental assistance for tenants facing COVID-19-related financial hardship, ensuring housing stability for undocumented New Yorkers and gig workers left out of State and Federal programs. Following her successful time at City Hall, Sarah joined the Lower Eastside Girls Club as Chief of Staff and was part of the leadership team that launched the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness , an intergenerational community space dedicated to transforming self-care into community care. Within two years, Sarah and her neighbors brought this vision to life, creating a thriving space with over 1,000 members on the Lower East Side. Sarah’s personal and professional experience continues to reinforce her mission to lead in the creation of healing spaces and supportive communities. And, above all, Sarah remains firmly rooted in her belief that all New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in their communities and in the best city in the world. 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 team@sarahbatchu.nyc team@sarahbatchu.nyc (‪347) 620-1238‬ (‪347) 620-1238‬ Facebook-f Facebook-f Twitter Twitter Linkedin-in Linkedin-in Instagram Instagram Paid For By Batchu For Council Loading Comments..."
