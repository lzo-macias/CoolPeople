    "text": "2009 Democratic primary by a margin of 12 points. [ 8 ] Williams won the general election [ 9 ] with an endorsement from the Working Families Party . [ 10 ] He was easily reelected in 2013. [ ] [ ] [ ] In June 2013, the New York City Council passed Williams's Community Safety Act, which established an Inspector General to oversee the New York Police Department (NYPD) and created an enforceable ban against bias-based profiling. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Act was passed over then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's veto. [ 13 ] Williams has been an outspoken opponent of the NYPD's approach to stop-and-frisk in New York City . [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In July 2013, Williams introduced \"house party\" legislation requiring parties with 40 or more people in attendance to register with the police. He also wants event organizers who advertise on social media and those charging admission to pay fines. [ 15 ] [ ] On June 29, 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed Williams's legislation, the Fair Chance Act, commonly known as Ban the Box . The law prohibits public and private employers from inquiring about an applicant's criminal history until a conditional offer of employment is made. [ 16 ] [ ] On August 13, 2015, the New York City Council passed Intro. 700, Williams's legislation, which, along with bills sponsored by Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito and Council Member Dan Garodnick , established regulations for \"tenant relocation specialists\", people landlords employ to buy out tenants. The mayor signed the legislation into law on September 9, 2015. [ 17 ] [ ] Williams has cited his religious beliefs as an influence on his views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion. He expressed opposition to gay marriage and abortion as recently as 2017, but has since altered his position on these issues. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] As of 2019, Williams had reportedly received a 100% rating from the Planned Parenthood of New York City Action Fund. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Williams resigned from office on March 19, 2019 to become New York City Public Advocate. [ 22 ] [ better source needed ] He declined to back his former staffer, Farah Louis , to succeed him on the city council, instead endorsing Monique Chandler-Waterman , [ 23 ] who lost to Louis in the May special election. [ 24 ] [ ] better source needed [ ] [ ] 2018 lieutenant gubernatorial campaign [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2018 , Williams challenged incumbent lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor , running on a platform of anti-corruption, affordable housing, and criminal justice reform. [ 25 ] Williams and Cynthia Nixon , who challenged incumbent governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, endorsed each other. Williams lost the primary by less than seven points. [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] New York City Public Advocate (2019-present) [ edit ] [ edit ] Williams ran in the 2019 special election for New York City Public Advocate when Letitia James vacated her seat to become New York state attorney general . [ 27 ] The New York Times endorsed him in both his 2018 campaign for lieutenant governor and his 2019 campaign for public advocate. [ 25 ] [ 28 ] The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America endorsed him in 2018, [ 29 ] but in 2019 did not endorse anyone for Public Advocate. The New York Daily News broke the story of his 2009 arrest in a domestic dispute, publishing records that had been sealed, which were used by rival candidates. [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In a crowded field with 18 other candidates, including former council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and state assemblyman Michael Blake , Williams won, with 33% of the vote to Mark-Viverito's 11% and Blake's 8%. Republican Eric Ulrich received 19%. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In his post-election remarks Williams said that he would work with Mayor de Blasio. [ 33 ] He was certified and sworn into office on March 19, 2019.

    "text": "Williams will become interim mayor until a special election can select a new mayor. [ 34 ] However, on April 2, 2025, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho, S.D.N.Y., granted the government's motion to dismiss the case in its entirely, and did so \"with prejudice\" (which the government had not sought) such that the case can never be brought again against Mayor Adams, who is therefore unlikely to resign. Accordingly, Williams cannot become interim mayor through this avenue. [ ] In 2024, Williams said he was against a proposed zoning change that would have eliminated parking mandates for new housing units. [ 35 ] [ ] 2022 gubernatorial campaign [ edit ] [ edit ] On September 28, 2021, Williams announced the formation of an exploratory committee to seek the Democratic nomination for governor in 2022. [ 36 ] On November 16, 2021, Williams formally announced his bid for governor. [ 37 ] Williams finished second in the June 2022 Democratic primary, losing to Gov. Kathy Hochul by a wide margin. [ 38 ] While Williams initially received the support of the Working Families Party, the Party dropped him from the ballot and endorsed Hochul following the June primary. [ 39 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Activism [ edit ] [ edit ] On September 5, 2011, during the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, Williams and Kirsten John Foy, director of community relations for then- New York City Public Advocate Bill de Blasio , were arrested and handcuffed for walking along a closed-off sidewalk, after having received permission to do so from other officers. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Williams was a supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement, [ 43 ] and in September 2012 was assaulted by a member of the NYPD at an Occupy Wall Street event. [ 42 ] [ 44 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Williams was also arrested in 2018 for protesting the detention of immigrant-rights activist Ravi Ragbir after Ragbir was detained during one of his regular check-ins with ICE . [ 45 ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] Williams was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome as a child [ 46 ] and has advocated for people with those conditions.
