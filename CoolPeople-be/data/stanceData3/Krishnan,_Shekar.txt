New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 25 Shekar Krishnan Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Woodside Biography Shekar Krishnan is the NYC Council Member for District 25, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Woodside, Queens, three of the most diverse immigrant communities in the world. He is the first Indian-American ever elected to the City Council in NYC history. Shekar is also Chair of the Council’s Committee On Parks and Recreation. He negotiated the highest budget ever for NYC Parks. As Parks Chair, Shekar has approached access to parks and expanding green space as a key component of social, racial, and immigrant justice. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Woodside are home to thousands of essential workers—many of whom are immigrants—who have carried this city forward during the pandemic. Shekar has championed a number of issues affecting our most vulnerable communities. He has been on the front lines fighting to: make sure the NYC government protects our taxi workers ; secure badly needed resources for public hospitals like Elmhurst Hospital ; ensure that New York City treats housing as as human right; end the practice of solitary confinement at Rikers Island; and expand public space for neighborhoods like his own that lack it. Shekar has been a champion for the 34th Avenue Open Street, 26 blocks of pedestrian space in Jackson Heights that is the gold standard of open streets across NYC. He is also working with Elmhurst Hospital to open a new infectious disease clinic, successfully advocated for Elmhurst’s Frank O’Connor Playground to be selected by the Parks Department as the Queens park slated for a full renovation under the citywide Community Parks Initiative, and built a much-needed dog run in the community. Before his election to City Council, Shekar was a long-time community activist in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst and civil rights lawyer fighting housing discrimination. He co-founded the legal services organization Communities Resist, a legal services organization highly acclaimed citywide for its community-rooted, intersectional approach to housing and racial justice in North Brooklyn and Queens. Shekar began his legal career with the landmark Broadway Triangle fair housing struggle against the City of New York, a successful case challenging a rezoning under the Fair Housing Act. He also co-founded Friends of Diversity Plaza. Located on the border of Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, Diversity Plaza has become a national symbol of how public space can bring people together. Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two small children, who can often be seen biking or scooting up and down the open 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow.

The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.  Initiatives Parkchester 2024 Community Engagement Bronx Metro North Area Study (BMNS) Engagement Speaker Adams’ Planning Toolkit and Housing Agenda Gowanus Neighborhood Plan: Racial Equity Report on Housing and Opportunity Morningside Heights Planning Study Inwood Rezoning Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan Planning for Retail Diversity East Harlem Rezoning Greater East Midtown Plan History Until 1989, the Council had no authority over land use issues. The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

This assessment will be provided to a person’s criminal defense attorney within 14 days of supreme court arraignment so that it may be used to inform charging, detention, release, or plea agreement decisions.

The Council has standing committees that practice oversight of New York City functions, including human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. Each committee is headed by a Council Member (the Chair), includes at least five members, and meets at least once a month. In addition, the Council has several subcommittees, which are convened to review and make recommendations regarding topics of particular interest. After proposed legislation is heard by its appropriate committee, it is then sent to be considered by the whole Council.

Introduction This bill would create a Division of Street Vendor Assistance within the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to assist street vendors. The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors.

Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

Introduction This bill would codify New York City’s (“City” or “NYC”) cooling center program. The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.

Introduction This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report annually information on school librarians and library access in DOE schools. The DOE would be required to report, for each school, the number of licensed and non-licensed school librarians; the number of students in grades 7 and 8 who have weekly scheduled class time with school librarians; and the average amount of time students spend in such classes. The DOE would also be required to report on the number and hours of operation of school libraries, including hours open to all students; the number of students at each school; and, for secondary schools with part-time licensed school librarians, whether the hours assigned comply with state minimum staffing requirements based on school enrollment.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, Shekar negotiated the highest budget ever for NYC Parks. He has approached access to parks and green space as a matter of social, racial, and immigrant justice. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside are home to thousands of essential workers—many of whom are immigrants—who carried this city forward during the pandemic and continue to keep our City running. Shekar has been a champion for them, fighting to: make our community affordable and safe, invest in Elmhurst Hospital and increase access to health care for all, make sure everyone can live in dignified housing, protect taxi workers, end the practice of solitary confinement at Rikers Island, and expand public green space for neighborhoods like our own that lack it. In his first terms, Shekar has made transformative investments in our health, our safety, and our public spaces, from a new surgery clinic at Elmhurst Hospital to safe play streets around schools and new playgrounds to Jackson Heights’ first public dog run. He has worked for our community across the board- launching a comprehensive 7 point plan to make Roosevelt Ave safer, making our Jackson Heights Post Office accessible, and fighting for our seniors healthcare and programs. Before his election to City Council, Shekar was a long-time community activist in Queens and a civil rights lawyer fighting housing discrimination. He co-founded the housing legal services organization Communities Resist. Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two young children and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate. OUR FIGHT & OUR WINS Now is the time for bold, inclusive change which both roots out corruption in politics and puts power in the hands of the people, especially our workers, our immigrants, and our families. See our goals and what we’ve achieved. GO TO OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS PAGE Shekar has spent years fighting alongside our community as an advocate and parent. He has organized with his neighbors around a number of critical community initiatives, including: educating immigrant tenants on their housing rights; fighting for racial justice and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline; coordinating the collection and delivery of PPE directly to the frontline workers at Elmhurst Hospital at the height of the pandemic; standing with the LGBTQIA+ community to root out hate and intolerance; advocating for safer streets for children and seniors; demanding far more public school funding; and mobilizing to protect and expand vital park space in Jackson Heights.

Achieving the goal would increase community resiliency and quality of life through protection, maintenance, and expansion of the New York City urban forest. The urban forest serves as critical natural infrastructure and provides myriad social, environmental, and economic and public health benefits, including cooling, shading, energy efficiency, cleaner air, stormwater absorption and filtration, increased property values, enhanced mental and physical health, and improved business activity. As New York City faces the challenges of increasing climate change impacts, trees help mitigate heat waves, more extreme rain events, and flooding that New Yorkers are experiencing with more regularity. Forest for All NYC, a coalition of over 80 local organizations across business, nonprofit, government, and academic sectors advance the NYC Urban Forest Agenda . Through their leadership, they have educated and built support for policies and goals to strengthen the urban forest and increase its benefits to all New Yorkers. Through organizing a successful inaugural City of Forest Day and encouraging a growing number of community boards to pass resolutions in support of the urban forest, momentum continues to grow for this important and ambitious goal. “The time is now for New York City to lead on this vital issue. Trees cool our streets, scrub our air, and soak up storm waters. They also support New Yorkers’ mental health in immeasurable ways,” said Parks Committee Chair Krishnan . “By setting this ambitious target, we will ensure our city is planning, tracking and meeting goals needed to protect the health and well-being of all New Yorkers.” “Street trees enhance quality of life and create a vibrant streetscape that is more welcoming and comfortable. Studies have shown that the presence of an urban canopy reduces heat and improves air quality, health and wellness, public safety, and more,” said Council Member Gale Brewer. “New York City must set a citywide goal of achieving at least 30% tree canopy cover by 2035. I have long been committed to supporting a healthy network of street trees with a focus on equity and applaud this effort.” “Our coalition thanks this majority of New York City’s Council Members who voiced their support for setting a goal of achieving at least 30% tree canopy cover by 2035,” said Emily Nobel Maxwell, Cities Director for The Nature Conservancy in New York, convener of Forest for All NYC. “Under the leadership of Parks Committee Chair Shekar Krishnan, we’re more energized and optimistic than ever that the hard work that went into the NYC Urban Forest Agend a, with its ambitious recommendations for action, will be realized and will benefit all New Yorkers in a just and equitable way.

City of Forest Day Agenda Coalition Accomplishments News Resources Join Us!    CITY OF FOREST DAY Photo credit: Jonathan Grassi Save the date! We are thrilled to announce that City of Forest Day 2025 is officially scheduled for Saturday, October 4, 2025 ! Presented by Forest for All NYC in partnership with the Parks and Open Space Partners coalition and NYC Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), City of Forest Day is an annual day of activities across the city to raise awareness of the importance of the New York City urban forest, and the essential role New Yorkers play every day in caring for the “lungs” of our city. Join us for this fourth annual celebration – registration will open this summer! Here are some ways that you can help care for the urban forest year-round: Check out our coalition members to learn about opportunities to be engaged in caring for the urban forest. Talk with others about trees, their benefits, and the NYC Urban Forest Agenda to amplify the message and advocate for trees. Read The State of the Urban Forest in NYC to learn more about the urban forest. Encourage organizations and businesses you’re connected with to join Forest for All NYC . When visiting the urban forest, please remember to: Keep our urban green spaces clean – including our street tree beds, public parks, community gardens and woodlands. Avoid climbing or hanging hammocks or other objects on trees. Stay on marked paths in parks and natural forested (woodland) areas. Keep dogs always leashed in woodland areas to protect sensitive wildlife areas. Enjoy flowers with your eyes, but do not pick blooms. With gratitude to The Nature Conservancy, NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, Trees New York, NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Prospect Park Alliance and City Parks Foundation for their thoughtful leadership and support in planning City of Forest Day. Forest for All NYC is convened and facilitated by The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy also expresses appreciation to every organization that is hosting an event for City of Forest Day, and to our generous funders who make City of Forest Day and the on-going work of Forest for All NYC possible: The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Anahata Foundation, and Con Edison.  NYC Urban Forest Agenda Our Coalition News Resources Join Us! NYC Urban Forest Agenda Our Coalition News Resources Join Us!

Read More Op-Ed | Universal swimming access in NYC will save lives On the most sweltering summer days in New York City, New Yorkers escape to the water. But for a city surrounded by water, a shocking number of New Yorkers can’t swim. And when they head to our pools and beaches to cool off every summer, the results can be tragic. Last summer, 19-year-old Amadou Thiam – home for summer break after his freshman year at Skidmore – drowned at Jacob Riis Park in the Rockaways. 15-year-old Markel Artis, a Bronx high schooler, drowned at Coney Island Beach. The list goes on. As Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, and as President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater New York and Co-Chair of the NYC Citywide Lifeguard & Aquatics Taskforce, we have seen firsthand the water safety challenges our city faces.  Every year, we lose too many New Yorkers to drowning.
