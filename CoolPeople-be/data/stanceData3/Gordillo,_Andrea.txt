0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu With working families struggling, renters facing displacement and skyrocketing rents, and the threat of climate disasters, our City must take immediate and bold action to build affordable housing, invest in environmental resilience, improve our mass transit, and expand access to culture for all. Andrea has seen our communities come together to make change, and she has the experience to make that power work for us in the City Council. We have the power to transform our City to one where your zipcode doesn’t impact your ability to access a good education, clean air, public transportation to get you to a job with a living wage. Read Andrea’s vision and commitment to our district: Housing and Affordability The rent is too damn high. Most New Yorkers spend more on rent than anything else. I’ve experienced that struggle. I’ve lived, worked in, and worked for this district for over a decade. I know what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck, and often without the security of healthcare coverage. Affordable housing is essential to the safety and dignity of all people. As the Chair of Community Board 3, I’ve advocated for increasing the supply of affordable housing, protecting existing affordable housing like HDFCs and rent stabilized units, and I’ve successfully worked to expand the number of Community Land Trusts (CLTs) in District 2, which has seen the most growth of CLTs compared to any other area in New York City. Working in a coalition with community groups and elected officials, I’ve helped secure hundreds of affordable and supportive housing units, and I won’t stop there. We need comprehensive solutions that make our housing stock affordable, accessible, sustainable, and secure. As your next Councilmember, I will work to: Preserve and Expand Affordable and Public Housing: Whether it’s nonprofit housing providers, NYCHA, Community Land Trusts (CLT’s), Housing Development Fund Cooperations (HDFC), or limited equity cooperatives, I’ll work to build resident power by expanding funding and legislation for programs that keep housing permanently affordable and off the speculative market. Develop Local Green Affordable Housing Projects : Council District 2 is a waterfront community that has faced more than its fair share of pollution and environmental problems over the years. As your Councilmember, I am committed to building at least 400 units of green and affordable housing on our local public land that not only addresses our housing shortage but also fights climate change and creates good union jobs. I will champion these local green affordable housing projects that put community voices at the forefront and ensure long-term affordability, climate resilience, and economic security for all residents. Homeownership Opportunities : I will work to increase Housing Preservation and Development programs to help low- and moderate-income families purchase homes, including expanding down payment assistance and homebuyer education programs. As Councilmember, I will work toward expanding the Mitchell-Llama program and other programs so that middle-income families can afford to live in our city. Tenant Protections : I will work to strengthen tenant protections against eviction, harassment, and displacement, including the expansion of the Right to Counsel. I will work to reform and remove barriers to housing vouchers, making it easier for property owners and tenants to rent homes. To accomplish this, I commit to hiring a full time housing organizer in my office who will work with residents to expand tenant power by ensuring your home is livable and your repairs are completed. Expanding Senior Housing : Our seniors laid the foundation of the beautiful city we know today, but many struggle to afford to stay here. I will work to ensure seniors can stay in their communities under safe, accessible, and livable conditions, by expanding our senior affordable housing programs. I’ll work to double the baseline of accessible units for people with mobility, visual, and hearing disabilities throughout all new developments. Fight for a Rent Freeze : More than two million New Yorkers live in a rent-stabilized unit, but under the current mayor, their rent has increased by 9%. Our city is becoming more and more expensive and the drastic rise in costs calls for necessary measures to ensure New Yorkers can afford to live here. As Councilmember, I’ll push the mayor and their appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board to freeze the rent for all rent-stabilized tenants. Create a Registry of Vacant Units: There are thousands of vacant units in New York City yet we currently do not maintain a comprehensive public registry of these vacant residential units. A registry will empower the City Council to hold landlords accountable to rent out their apartments to New Yorkers. I will work to create incentives for landlords to maintain affordable rents and will work to impose escalating fines on landlords who warehouse these units. We must create pathways for low and extremely low income households to receive these units and I will work to do that. By implementing these policies, we can ensure that New York City remains an affordable and inclusive place for all residents, regardless of income. Climate Justice and Resiliency As a resident of the waterfront and member of LES Ready, our local disaster preparedness group, I understand the need for climate justice as we work to build a more resilient Manhattan. The threat of climate disasters like extreme storms, floods, and heat waves require us to act now. As your Councilperson, I’ll work to ensure new solutions to combating, adapting, and mitigating the climate crisis work for all residents of District 2, but particularly communities who have lived through environmental racism. I’ll work with all levels of government to implement a Green New Deal for NYC through effective interventions that work to fight climate change, like improving our neighborhoods’ infrastructure to make it more resilient, and make investments in green union jobs as technology changes and innovate our economy. I’ll work to expand dignified cooling centers during extreme heat emergencies, and assure that all seniors have access. I’ll ensure that our neighborhood’s green spaces, parks, and community gardens, and other open spaces, are well maintained to address and provide reprieve from increasing frequency and severity of heat waves. I’ll work to transition our neighborhoods from Fossil Fuels to Clean Energy. A Liveable New York I’ve worked tirelessly to create educational opportunities that address the pressing issues we face—housing, public health, climate justice, and the struggles of small businesses. I’ve secured millions in funding to support our artists, sustain vital public programs like the City Artist Corps, and nourish our cultural ecosystem. I have collaborated with visionary artists and leaders who weave together our cultural legacies with grassroots organizing, lifting up the working class, our seniors, individuals with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQI communities. I’ve worked to defend the culture of our neighborhoods for over a decade. In the City Council, I’ll work to champion the many artists, creatives, independent venues and arts spaces that contribute to the cultural, creative, and artistic hub that is New York City, particularly in Greenwich Village, Lower East Side, East Village, Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square, Gramercy, and Murray Hill-Kips Bay. With 10,000 cultural workers operating every day in our district, I’ll work to create programs and opportunities to put artists to work on making our streets, public spaces, transportation, schools, and senior centers more beautiful, cleaner, greener, and safer, and I have the experience to make it happen. Public Safety More coming soon.

New Economy Project has used maps as a visual tool for 25 years, but so many of these maps are about showing extraction from vulnerable communities, says executive director Deyanira Del Río.“We’ve prepared hundreds of maps showing subprime lending, foreclosures, other forms of predatory lending that are overwhelmingly concentrated in majority Black and Brown communities across the city,” Del Río says. “We’ve produced maps that show the absence of bank branches in those communities and the proliferation of check cashers, pawn shops and other high cost predatory services that fill the gap that banks leave behind. This map is one of the few maps we’ve created that show the affirmative community-driven solutions that communities around the city are putting forward.” New Economy Project has used maps as a visual tool for 25 years, but so many of these maps are about showing extraction from vulnerable communities, says executive director Deyanira Del Río.“We’ve prepared hundreds of maps showing subprime lending, foreclosures, other forms of predatory lending that are overwhelmingly concentrated in majority Black and Brown communities across the city,” Del Río says. “We’ve produced maps that show the absence of bank branches in those communities and the proliferation of check cashers, pawn shops and other high cost predatory services that fill the gap that banks leave behind.

Some of these CLTs have been able to acquire land and now buildings. For example, The East Harlem/El Barrio Community Land Trust , formed in 2014, acquired its first four buildings in November 2020 for just $1 each. Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, GrowHouse NYC has played a different role in protecting its community members:  After establishing the BLAC Land Trust, the organization secured citywide recognition of the Flatbush African Burial Ground, preventing its sale to private developers in 2021. Some of these CLTs have been able to acquire land and now buildings. For example, Why are community land trusts growing in NYC? Why are community land trusts growing in NYC? Every initiative on the interactive map began with a group of people organizing against racial and socioeconomic inequality, Del Río says. Ultimately, their organizing efforts led them to pursue collective ownership through community land trusts. Every initiative on the interactive map began with a group of people organizing against racial and socioeconomic inequality, CLTs are non-profit, democratically-governed organizations that acquire and steward land on behalf of community members. CLTs can offer long-term use of the lands to individual property owners through a renewable ground lease to create permanently affordable residential, commercial and community spaces. With the separation of building and land, CLTs can ensure that the building usage — apartments, a community center, etc – is rented at an affordable price rather than being treated as a commodity. CLTs are non-profit, democratically-governed organizations that acquire and steward land on behalf of community members. What’s behind the surge in CLTs across New York over the past two decades? What’s behind the surge in CLTs across New York over the past two decades? Del Río says that the creation of the New York City Community Land Initiative (NYCCLI), a coalition of grassroots organizing and social justice groups working to advance non-speculative housing and neighborhood-led development, is one of the main factors. Born from the collaborative efforts between Picture the Homeless, New Economy Project, and Manhattan Community Board 11, NYCCLI officially formed as a coalition in 2014 although their work began long before that. Since the coalition’s founding, 10 times more CLTs have hit New York City and they’re developing at a much faster rate than ever before, Del Río says. Del Río says that the creation of the Del Río attributes NYCCLI’s base building, constant outreach and popular education efforts to more and more organizing groups discovering CLTs as a possible way of securing stability and income for rent-burdened communities. Del Río When the coalition started, Del Río says, the first thing they noticed was a massive information gap and lack of awareness about the impact CLTs can have on underresourced communities. They began by using Cooper Square as an example of a transformative model of a successful social housing practice. One of their popular education tools is a board game called Trustville , where players pretend to be CLT board members themselves. When the coalition started, Del Río also points to a hard-fought $7.5 million city council investment , which began in 2019 and has been renewed annually ever since, toward fostering CLTs. Del Río “We want this map to show city council members who have invested just how deep the impact is. It’s a way to highlight the amazing work and scale up,” says Dey. “We want this map to show city council members who have invested just how deep the impact is. It’s a way to highlight the amazing work and scale up,” says Dey. NYCCLI members — including many organized groups like the Northwest Bronx Community & Clergy Coalition — did hundreds of hours of outreach to secure the introduction and sponsorship of many city council bills prioritizing CLTs when the city is developing public land or when a landlord sells. Edward Garcia, organizing director at the Northwest Bronx Community & Clergy Coalition, says he hopes this map shows city officials that there is an ecosystem of people working hard to make these CLTs happen.  “Hopefully these maps show elected officials how hard we’re working and help us get the visibility we need to secure more resources for our people,” says Garcia.
