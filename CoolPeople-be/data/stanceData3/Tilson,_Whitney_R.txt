New Yorkers are hurting and angry and looking for change – and I am the only change candidate in the Democratic primary. I’m the only candidate in the race with a business background, and the only one who isn’t a career politician. Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered innovative solutions to complex problems, from helping local entrepreneurs thrive to supporting global humanitarian initiatives. I am a pro-business Democrat and a competent manager New Yorkers can trust. As Mayor, I promise to: • Revitalize our economy, creating wealth, prosperity, jobs, and higher wages. • Tackle the affordability crisis, especially housing, which is crushing all but the richest New Yorkers. • Cut crime 50% by investing in the communities in which most crime occurs, hiring 5,000 more police officers, and making crime illegal again. • End street homelessness by forbidding it – and expanding and improving our shelter system. It’s not normal and it’s not acceptable that more than 4,000 people are sleeping on the streets every night. They are suffering and it’s incredibly dangerous for them – and for all of us. • Fix our public schools. Why I’m Running for Mayor Let me summarize my campaign: if you love this city, are worried it’s headed in the wrong direction and you’re looking for new leadership, I am the only change candidate in the Democratic primary. I’m the only one who’s not a career politician, and who has a business background. I'm going to root out widespread corruption and manage this city a lot better. I’m a lifelong, hard-core Democrat. I grew up in Tanzania and Nicaragua, the child of teachers who met and married in the Peace Corps. Throughout my life I’ve been tackling big problems, fighting injustice and helping people who are hurting. 35 years ago, my first job out of college was helping start Teach for America right here in New York City. Five years ago, when we were the epicenter of the global pandemic and 800 New Yorkers were dying every day, I didn’t flee the city – I volunteered 12 hours a day for months helping to build and operate the field hospital in Central Park. And as recently as last September, I was on the front lines in Ukraine, dodging Russian drones, delivering aid to soldiers fighting for their country’s freedom. Susan and I raised our three daughters in New York City, and they’re now building their lives here. But this happy story of a healthy city in which the next generation stays and thrives is becoming increasingly rare, as long-time working class New Yorkers are leaving at an alarming rate. People are leaving first and foremost because they can’t pay their rent. While rents across the country have been going down, ours, already the highest, have continued to rise because of simple supply and demand. A lot of people still want to live here, but we’ve made it almost impossible to build new housing and maintain existing units. Secondly, people don’t feel safe. Five years ago, after decades of progress, we had become one of the safest large cities in America. But since then, the seven major felonies are up an average of more than 30%. And lastly, people with children are leaving because, despite spending $40 billion – more than $43,000 per child – nearly half the kids in our public schools can’t read at even a basic level. I wish I could blame the Republicans for our decline, but I can’t. We’re a one-party city and state. City Hall has become corrupt, bloated and beholden to special interests. It’s a toxic combination of bad ideas, executed badly. New Yorkers know it – which is why, in the last three presidential elections, Donald Trump has increased his share of the vote in the city from 17% to 23% to 30%. If you think we’re doing great and want another career politician to run this city, then I’m not your man. But if you’re fed up with how badly they’re running this city and want real change, I’m the only change candidate in the race. When I’m elected mayor, I won’t owe anything to anyone, so I’ll be fighting solely for the people of New York City. I pledge to end street homelessness, cut crime in half, double construction of affordable housing, and make New York the best city for small businesses in the world. Please join me in the fight for greater prosperity, affordability and safety for every New Yorker, because New York deserves better!

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Why I'm still saying to 'sit tight'; Bill Ackman has a new position in Hertz Global April 21, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) The main reason I've still been saying to "sit tight" amid all the recent market turmoil is that I worry that the Trump administration's tariff plans have put us into uncharted economic waters. Businesses large and small are constantly making critical decisions about investments, sourcing, pricing, and so forth. And right now, most are uncertain at best... and paralyzed at worst. The latest evidence for this is the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released last week based on data collected from April 2 to April 9 in the immediate aftermath of "Liberation Day" (you can read the entire report here ). While the report only captures manufacturers in New York state, the findings are consistent with what I'm seeing and hearing across Corporate America... The 11 current indicators are stable (other than sharp increases in "Prices Paid" and "Prices Received"). But the forward-looking indicators – based on expectations for the next six months – are alarming. Here are the first four forward-looking indicators from the report – look at the sharp declines in the past few months: As the New York Fed summarizes: Firms expect conditions to worsen in the months ahead, a level of pessimism that has only occurred a handful of times in the history of the survey. Of course, pessimism and uncertainty are usually the friend of the long-term stock market investor because they can create mispriced bargains. But as I look at dozens of stocks (many of which I've discussed in recent e-mails), I'm finding that since they started at such high valuations – recall that the market was at an all-time high only two months ago – they're not as cheap as I would want to see today... especially in light of the economic and tariff uncertainties. So with my top-down and bottom-up analyses flashing "red" and "yellow," respectively, I'll repeat what I said last week ... My "spidey sense" isn't telling me to either buy or sell across the board , so I continue to believe that sitting tight remains the best course. 2) Car-rental giant Hertz Global (HTZ) caught my eye last week when its shares rose a staggering 126% in two trading days last week after my college buddy Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a stake of just less than 20% of the company. On Thursday afternoon, Bill shared his investment thesis in a long post on social platform X . Excerpt: We believe that a combination of: (1) an improving industry structure and more rational competitive behavior, (2) the near resolution of the company's over exposure to Teslas, (3) a successful operational turnaround plan under a new management team with a track record of success in an adjacent industry, and (4) the company's leveraged capital structure will enable Hertz shareholders to generate a highly attractive return on investment. Bill also thinks Hertz could benefit from tariffs on new cars leading to an increase in prices for used cars: Hertz is uniquely well-positioned in the current tariff environment, where auto tariffs are likely to cause used car prices to rise. Hertz owns a fleet of over 500,000 vehicles valued at approximately $12 billion. A 10% increase in used car prices would equate to a $1.2 billion gain on its auto assets – equivalent to approximately half of the company's current market capitalization. He concludes by laying out a scenario in which the stock could be worth $30 per share (it closed Thursday at $8.24): Using management's nearer term targets of $1,500 revenue per unit (RPU), low $30s/day vehicle operating expenses, and ~$300 depreciation per unit (DPU), and assuming modest increases by 2029, including an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, we estimate that Hertz could generate approximately $2 billion of Adjusted EBITDA (a metric which is net of auto depreciation and interest expense for the company's fleet and asset-backed financing). At 7.5 times EBITDA, a valuation that we believe to be conservative in light of improvements in the competitive posture of the industry, we estimate that Hertz will be worth ~$30 per share by 2029. Since Hertz emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, its stock (until last week) had been a bust: When we take a look at Hertz's financials, we'll see why... Revenue and net income plunged during the pandemic, but then recovered strongly in 2021 and 2022 before profits once again plunged last year: Free cash flow ("FCF") surged as the company sold down its fleet in 2020 to try to stave off bankruptcy. But otherwise, it has been consistently negative. Take a look at this chart of operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: And while Hertz was able to reduce its debt during bankruptcy, since then it's back to almost $18 billion: Hertz's financials are ugly. There's a decent chance that the company becomes a "Chapter 22" – in other words, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a second time. But that doesn't mean I think Bill is wrong to put a small percentage of assets into this stock. That's because this setup reminds me a bit of the single best investment I've made in my career – one for which I owe Bill a debt of gratitude... I bought more than 1 million shares of mall operator General Growth Properties ("GGP") shortly before it filed for bankruptcy in April 2009. My average purchase price was just $0.67 a share. By the end of the year, the stock had soared to $11.56 per share – and I had made more than 17 times my money. I might have been tempted to sell much earlier than I did, but Bill bought a large chunk of the company and gave a brilliant 68-slide presentation at the Sohn Conference on May 27, 2009, which you can see here: The Buck's Rebound Begins Here . With the stock around $1 per share, he argued that it was worth between $9.11 and $21.50 per share (see page 57 of his presentation). Bill was ultimately proven correct, as GGP's stock soared above $20 per share (the company was acquired by Brookfield Property Partners for more than $9 billion in 2018). So why don't I see the same opportunity in Hertz's shares today? There are two main reasons... The first is valuation. When I bought it at $0.67 per share, GGP's entire market cap was only a bit more than $200 million. With Hertz, after more than doubling last week, its market cap is about $2.5 billion. That's a big difference... Second, Hertz is a low-quality, cash-burning business that saw its earnings plunge last year. On the other hand, GGP (as Bill showed in his presentation) was a great business: Even during the worst of the global financial crisis, its malls continued to generate strong, stable cash flows that far exceeded what it needed to service its debts. Thus, even though GGP wouldn't emerge from bankruptcy until November 2010, once the panic passed investors bid the stock up because they could see the value of the underlying business above and beyond its debt. It's unclear whether this will happen with Hertz going forward. To avoid bankruptcy, the company needs to change its downward trajectory by executing well. And it probably also has to get lucky with a jump in used-car prices. So Hertz at these levels is an interesting speculation... but nowhere near the no-brainer GGP was in early 2009.

Excerpt: We believe that a combination of: (1) an improving industry structure and more rational competitive behavior, (2) the near resolution of the company's over exposure to Teslas, (3) a successful operational turnaround plan under a new management team with a track record of success in an adjacent industry, and (4) the company's leveraged capital structure will enable Hertz shareholders to generate a highly attractive return on investment. Bill also thinks Hertz could benefit from tariffs on new cars leading to an increase in prices for used cars: Hertz is uniquely well-positioned in the current tariff environment, where auto tariffs are likely to cause used car prices to rise. Hertz owns a fleet of over 500,000 vehicles valued at approximately $12 billion. A 10% increase in used car prices would equate to a $1.2 billion gain on its auto assets – equivalent to approximately half of the company's current market capitalization. He concludes by laying out a scenario in which the stock could be worth $30 per share (it closed Thursday at $8.24): Using management's nearer term targets of $1,500 revenue per unit (RPU), low $30s/day vehicle operating expenses, and ~$300 depreciation per unit (DPU), and assuming modest increases by 2029, including an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, we estimate that Hertz could generate approximately $2 billion of Adjusted EBITDA (a metric which is net of auto depreciation and interest expense for the company's fleet and asset-backed financing). At 7.5 times EBITDA, a valuation that we believe to be conservative in light of improvements in the competitive posture of the industry, we estimate that Hertz will be worth ~$30 per share by 2029. Since Hertz emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, its stock (until last week) had been a bust: When we take a look at Hertz's financials, we'll see why... Revenue and net income plunged during the pandemic, but then recovered strongly in 2021 and 2022 before profits once again plunged last year: Free cash flow ("FCF") surged as the company sold down its fleet in 2020 to try to stave off bankruptcy. But otherwise, it has been consistently negative. Take a look at this chart of operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: And while Hertz was able to reduce its debt during bankruptcy, since then it's back to almost $18 billion: Hertz's financials are ugly. There's a decent chance that the company becomes a "Chapter 22" – in other words, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a second time. But that doesn't mean I think Bill is wrong to put a small percentage of assets into this stock. That's because this setup reminds me a bit of the single best investment I've made in my career – one for which I owe Bill a debt of gratitude... I bought more than 1 million shares of mall operator General Growth Properties ("GGP") shortly before it filed for bankruptcy in April 2009. My average purchase price was just $0.67 a share. By the end of the year, the stock had soared to $11.56 per share – and I had made more than 17 times my money. I might have been tempted to sell much earlier than I did, but Bill bought a large chunk of the company and gave a brilliant 68-slide presentation at the Sohn Conference on May 27, 2009, which you can see here: The Buck's Rebound Begins Here . With the stock around $1 per share, he argued that it was worth between $9.11 and $21.50 per share (see page 57 of his presentation). Bill was ultimately proven correct, as GGP's stock soared above $20 per share (the company was acquired by Brookfield Property Partners for more than $9 billion in 2018). So why don't I see the same opportunity in Hertz's shares today? There are two main reasons... The first is valuation. When I bought it at $0.67 per share, GGP's entire market cap was only a bit more than $200 million. With Hertz, after more than doubling last week, its market cap is about $2.5 billion. That's a big difference... Second, Hertz is a low-quality, cash-burning business that saw its earnings plunge last year. On the other hand, GGP (as Bill showed in his presentation) was a great business: Even during the worst of the global financial crisis, its malls continued to generate strong, stable cash flows that far exceeded what it needed to service its debts. Thus, even though GGP wouldn't emerge from bankruptcy until November 2010, once the panic passed investors bid the stock up because they could see the value of the underlying business above and beyond its debt. It's unclear whether this will happen with Hertz going forward. To avoid bankruptcy, the company needs to change its downward trajectory by executing well. And it probably also has to get lucky with a jump in used-car prices. So Hertz at these levels is an interesting speculation... but nowhere near the no-brainer GGP was in early 2009.

Both of those statements can't be right. So maybe it's just a matter of semantics. After all, negotiations do seem to be playing out through the media.

Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on Topics or Protected Audience data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using Attribution Reporting data stored on their browser or mobile device. More information on the Privacy Sandbox . How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google. For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also set cookies on your browser or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising. Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our Advertising page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information. Our Privacy Policy explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users. Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so. Ad personalization If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google. If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse. When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads. You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings . How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services: Ad Settings helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also learn how ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers. If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings, My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity. Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on . Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy . Incognito mode in Chrome allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about cookies . Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Company Stansberry Research is a subscription-based publisher of financial information and software, serving millions of investors around the world. Our business is guided by two simple principles: We strive to give our customers the information we'd want if our roles were reversed. We only publish analysts whose advice and strategies we'd want our own families to read and to follow. We believe in offering a range of opinions. Experienced analysts, with their own unique investment strategies and philosophies, lead our franchise brands. As a result, we do not promote a single, unified view of the markets, but instead we publish a mosaic of opinions, recommendations, and strategies. This multi-franchise approach gives our work far greater breadth, creating more diverse opportunities for our subscribers. Our franchises are linked, however, by a continuous commitment to risk management and a contrarian approach to identifying investment opportunities. Across all of our franchises, we focus on investments that are unloved, ignored, or unknown. It is in these situations where having an informed perspective gives our subscribers the best risk-to-reward opportunities.

California residents can submit requests to opt out of the sale of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). AppChoices gives you transparency with participating companies, and lets you limit their collection of cross-app data for interest-based ads. Brought to you by the Digital Advertising Alliance, and backed up by the DAAâs independent accountability program, AppChoices lets you opt out from interest-based advertising with a particular company, or âChoose All Companiesâ with one simple click. Did you know that some of the ads you receive in apps are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your app usage? This is called interest-based advertising (IBA). AppChoices gives you choices about whether you receive this type of advertising that is based on cross-app data collected over time across different apps and devices.Â To opt out your device ID out of IBA from a particular company, simply navigate to Device ID-Based Choice tool and set the switch next to the companyâs logo from ââONâ to âOFFâ. AppChoices lets you decide which, if any, participating companies deliver interest-based advertising to your device. Using the new Token ID-Based Choice (beta) tool, you can opt out or revoke having your data collected or used for IBA linked to the email address you provide. When it comes to ads in your apps based on your interests, itâs your choice. California residents may also use AppChoices to submit requests to opt out from the sale of personal information under the CCPA for this device for some or all of the participating companies. To request an opt out for a particular company, set the Status button located next to the company's logo to "Send." Select "CA Opt Out Send All" to opt out from all the listed companies. To learn more about a particular company's policies, click on its logo. AppChoices tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ disponible en espaÃ±ol. Solo establece la configuraciÃ³n al idioma espaÃ±ol. You may still receive other types of advertising in your apps from participating DAA companies, and these companies (and other apps) may still collect information for other purposes consistent with the DAA Principles. You can learn more about these Principles and the DAAâs enforcement and accountability program by visiting www.aboutads.info/enforcement. The CCPA opt outs provided through this Tool apply to the sale of personal information by participating companies. You may still receive advertisements that do not involve the sale of personal information subject to the CCPA. V 2.1 Whatâs New Version 2.1.8 App improvements and bug fixes Ratings and Reviews 2.3      325 Ratings   Inevitable79 , REALLY? WHY? TRASHYâ¦ Why do we have to keep downloading all of these apps to control our lives and privacy. I donât understand these apps or their intentional confusing lingo. But I donât think that by downloading these apps Iâm helping anything, because now Iâve went and allowed or downloaded their (spyware) on my phone. Whatever California did to protect their citizens privacy needs to be done nationwide. Because Iâm 98% sure that the people who created these trashy data stealing and ad targeting software live in California. Thatâs how they protect their data and their families from the same data stealing practices that they created. Well I think this app is trash and I also think cell phone companies (all of them) who sell their customers data are TRASH PEOPLE that should be held responsible for data theft. BTW Donât forget to click on (Do Not Sale or Share my Data) on your phone companies website or app the next time youâre happily paying your bill or trying to get someone to help you. I was shocked to find out that my phone company that ive been with for about 10 years was selling and sharing my personal data this entire time.   jeffreytstarr , Ditto to { BATMAN }âs review of 3 yrs ago; Doesnât Work! When I opened the app and followed what seemed intuitive to opt out of one or all advertisers, I didnât receive any feedback indicating the settings changed. At that point I (foolishly?) decided to read the instructions.  It instructs to âsimply move the switch from On to Off next to the advertising company you wish to opt out.â  In my case, tapping the âdigital switchâ changes selection from On to Send, but nothing ever activates or verified anything being Sent.  I then went to the Reviews to see if I am the only one having this issue, which would indicate to me that the problem is me and not with the app.  I came upon a review written 3 yrs ago by {BATMAN} in which he writes, â...when you view the list of ad companies, and try and follow the instructions to opt out, the opt out button doesn't work.  It just does nothing.â  That states perfectly, my experience today as well. So much has changed in this world over the past 3 years, but this app becoming functional is not one of them.   Geahjib , The app works the way it was designed Just a reminder because lots of people are stupid and donât read. This WILL NOT disable ads. This is only to opt out of PERSONALIZED ads. This will stop advertising companies from tracking your web/app usage and hitting you with ads targeted toward your interests. Instead you will be blasted with general ads not specifically aimed at you or your interests. The only reason I gave it one star. Is because the DAA is garbage and ads are pointless altogether. Just download the app opt out for all then delete it. All set! If you donât want to see ads anymore get Adblock. I would recommend doing both. If you use only adblockers your app/internet usage is still tracked and sent back to the DAA but you just wonât see the personal ads they send you. So do both. Then they cant steal your info or hit you with ads. But seriously ads are garbage and they donât work. If we want your product we will buy it. But spamming me with ads does the opposite. I wonât buy your garbage App Privacy The developer, Digital Advertising Alliance , indicated that the appâs privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free I'm waiting for my 'spidey sense' to start tingling; President Trump is more concerned about interest rates and the bond market than the stock market; Nate Silver on why relying on the markets to 'tame Trump' is a mistake; Nobody seems to care much about the March inflation report April 11, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) Well, the reality is setting in... Markets gave back some of their huge gains from Wednesday, with the S&P 500 Index falling 3.5% yesterday. Investors are coming to grips with what I wrote in yesterday's e-mail : Just because a huge catastrophe – think a 2008-style financial crisis – is likely off the table doesn't mean we're out of the woods. As I said: Even during a 90-day pause (and who knows what happens after that?), the tariff regime is still going to be a shock to the international system... I'm particularly worried about the tariff battle with China because of the size of the trade between the countries, the level of tariffs, and the reality that both countries are ruled by proud, stubborn men. So compromise here will be difficult. Personally, I haven't been selling anything amid the recent turmoil. But I haven't been buying anything, either. I'm waiting for my "spidey sense" to start tingling – but as I've said in multiple e-mails recently, I'm hunting for bargains to put on my radar screen . 2) Most stock investors aren't aware of this... But the bond markets are much larger than stock markets – and bond investors are less tolerant of volatility and losses. So major financial crises (like the global financial crisis) generally occur when bond markets rather than stock markets break down. This risk – and the rise in interest rates – is likely why President Donald Trump announced his 90-day tariff pause on Wednesday. Barry Ritholtz of Ritholtz Wealth Management posted this summary on social platform X yesterday : And a thread on X from The Kobeissi Letter has more details . As it begins: And as it continues: Finally, as the thread concluded: I will continue to follow interest rates and the bond market more closely than usual – and share it with my readers – because I think it will tell us what Trump is likely to do. 3) Meanwhile, statistician Nate Silver does a good job of analyzing why investors are still very much on edge in yesterday's post in his Silver Bulletin blog: We shouldn't rely on markets to tame Trump . As Silver says, it comes down to investors trying to account for multiple degrees of uncertainty all at the same time: 1. The immediate effect of tariffs; 2. Second-order effects on consumer, business, and investor confidence; 3. Potential spillovers into broader financial markets – particularly the bond market , which had apparently spooked Trump , and 4. What the tariffs imply about Trump's future actions and the United States' overall state capacity . As he puts it: Investors are relying on a lot of implicit assumptions about an economic world order led by a relatively rational superpower – the United States – that may no longer hold. And as Silver continues: True, you'd rather have seen Trump capitulate [on Wednesday] than not. One remarkable feature of markets is that they provide a scoreboard – real-time feedback that even notoriously stubborn Silicon Valley types tend to take seriously. But considering those four buckets above, how secure should investors be feeling? Even with the 90-day pause, consumers and businesses will still be spooked by this and will experience higher prices from the tariffs that remain in place. The long-term effects on the United States' cultural and financial hegemony are harder to quantify but potentially significant. Markets and elites "got through" to Trump this time, but what if he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed 90 days from now and isn't in such a generous mood? Not that I think headline writers should be catering to Trump's mood swings, but triumphant headlines from Democrats about how Trump " surrendered " might give him second thoughts about doing the same thing next time around if he's worried about looking like a loser. In summary, fasten your seat belt... prepare for more volatility... and don't obsess over the chaotic short-term news flow. Keep your eyes on the horizon. 4) Lost amid all the volatility in the stock market was the March inflation report the government released yesterday... It showed lower-than-expected price gains, which normally would have made for bigger news. In fact, a month-over-month decline happened for the first time in nearly five years. Meanwhile, year-over-year inflation cooled to 2.4%. But nobody really cares because of fears that tariffs will spike inflation going forward. Here's the Wall Street Journal with more on this point: Inflation Eased in March, but Tariffs Threaten to Stoke Price Pressures . Excerpt: Normally, a slowdown in year-over-year price increases would be welcome news for consumers, who have faced years of high inflation, and the Federal Reserve, which has been struggling to bring down price pressures. But this time, it will be hard for investors, policymakers and businesses to read too much into the March data. President Trump's "Liberation Day" announcement of sweeping new tariffs didn't happen until April 2, which means their direct effects won't show up until the next consumer-price report a month from now. The article also cited this point from U.S. Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino: "It's good news for the Fed, but the data seems stale." While the recent inflation numbers are indeed "stale," the fact that both overall and core inflation are now below 3% gives the Fed more flexibility to cut rates to offset or at least mitigate a tariff-induced recession. As a former hedge-fund-manager friend of mine – who posts anonymously on X under the handle BeenThereDoneThat Capital – posted yesterday : On the plus side, my friend is right that the Fed now has room to cut rates to stimulate the economy if needed. (Investors are now expecting four rate cuts this year, up from one just a couple of months ago.) But there's a risk that if tariffs lead to higher inflation and an economic slowdown, the Fed's cuts could fuel even greater inflation. This is yet another risk factor to monitor...

The second-most popular stock among the four I mentioned to my readers last week was luxury furnishings retailer RH (RH) – better known as Restoration Hardware. (The top one was Align Technology (ALGN), which I discussed in yesterday's e-mail .) As a reminder, RH had tumbled by a staggering 40.1% last Thursday after reporting earnings per share that heavily missed expectations. CEO Gary Friedman even used a four-letter word (probably inadvertently) on the conference call when he heard how his company's stock was reacting. This recent Wall Street Journal article has more details: The Day Trump's Tariffs Shook Corporate America . Excerpt: Restoration Hardware Chief Executive Gary Friedman was on a call with analysts Wednesday afternoon talking about the furniture retailer's strategy and how the housing market could slow in this economic environment when news of the tariffs broke. He asked colleagues to get a "live read" of his business to check how the company's stock was doing. "Oh really? Oh, s---, OK," Friedman said in the moment. "Everybody can see in our 10-K where we're sourcing from so it's not a secret." More than 70% of the furniture company's products come from Asia, according to its annual report, including 35% from Vietnam and 23% from China, where steep new duties were put in place. RH closed yesterday at $149.36 per share. It's down from more than $700 per share in 2021 and sits at a roughly five-year low, as you can see in this 10-year stock chart: A move like that certainly gets my bargain-hunting heart racing. So today, let's take a closer look at the stock and see if there's a bottom-fishing opportunity here... Looking at RH's financials, I'll start as usual with long-term revenue and net income: This isn't very impressive... As you can see, RH was barely breaking even in 2016 and 2017. It caught a tailwind during the COVID-19 pandemic as everyone stayed at home and bought nice home furnishings... but revenues have declined and profits have crashed since the world reopened. Turning to the cash-flow statement, RH showed strong growth in free cash flow ("FCF") from 2018 to 2021. But since then, it has been all downhill – turning negative the past two years. And keep in mind, this is before the impact of tariffs. The below chart of the company's cash from operations, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF tells the story... I don't like the balance sheet, either. As you can see in the chart below, RH's net debt has tripled to $3.9 billion in the past three years: The company's FCF over the past three years has been close to flat (an average of negative $17 million), so how has net debt risen by more than $2.5 billion? To answer that, let's look at capital allocation on the cash-flow statement... RH has never paid a dividend and hasn't made any material acquisitions, so we can see that the main reason its debt has soared is that it bought more than $2.2 billion of its own stock in 2022 and 2023: At least the company didn't buy back stock at its absurd heights in 2021. But nevertheless, the share repurchases over the next two years were very poorly timed... As you can see in the stock chart above, shares might have appeared cheap in those years – having been cut by more than half. In reality, they weren't cheap at all... as they were consistently more than double today's price. (This is a good lesson on the perils of anchoring on an artificially high price.) We can see that the share repurchases in 2017 and in 2022 and 2023 reduced the share count, but in very different ways: In 2017, RH spent about $1 billion and retired 14 million shares at an average price of about $72 per share. That's a smart use of cash. But in 2022 and 2023, the company spent more than $2.2 billion and only reduced the share count by 11 million shares – at an average price above $200 per share, which also is well above current prices. And now RH is saddled with a dangerously high debt burden (about $3.9 billion) that exceeds its $3.1 billion market cap (as of yesterday's close), giving it a roughly $7.0 billion enterprise value. Is this cheap? Well, if you believe management's guidance, perhaps... In its fourth-quarter earnings release last week, RH gave the following guidance for this year: Revenue growth in a range of 10% to 13%. Adjusted operating margin in a range of 14% to 15%. Adjusted earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") margin in a range of 20% to 21%. Following this guidance, analysts are projecting earnings of $10.28 per share this year. That would mean that, as of yesterday's close, the stock is trading at 14.5 times its forward price to earnings. But I would be skeptical of the guidance based on the profit and cash-flow trends of the past three years, plus the terrible capital allocation decision to lever up the balance sheet to buy back stock at inflated prices. And now tariffs are a huge negative wild card that could literally bankrupt this business (though I don't think that's likely). Meanwhile, the odds of a recession that could really hurt the business have gone up as well. Friedman has mostly been leading RH since 2001, when the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. After 17 years, RH finally had four great years from 2018 to 2021... but it has been all downhill since then. So perhaps his retailing genius isn't all that it seems. I'll note that I have a number of smart friends who really like RH's stock. But based on what I'm seeing in the financials, not only isn't it even remotely interesting, but last week's 40% blowup should have been easily foreseeable. Don't be tempted to bottom-fish this one... Best regards, Whitney P.S. I welcome your feedback – send me an e-mail by clicking here .

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Why I'm 'sitting tight' amid the negative news flow April 15, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share During times of market turmoil, it's critically important to keep a clear head and a long-term perspective. That's easy to say... But it's hard to do when we're bombarded by a 24/7 news cycle, which tends to reinforce the prevailing narrative in the financial media. And that narrative is generally negative these days. Take a look at just some of what has come across my screen... First up are these charts from the Financial Times . As you can see, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has hit all-time highs – both in the U.S. and globally: When it comes to the tariff situation, China could retaliate against us by targeting services, where we run a big trade surplus with the country. Take a look at the chart in this post on social platform X from Charles Schwab's Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders: Turning to this Bloomberg chart from another post on X, the percentage of American subprime auto borrowers falling behind on their car payments is at an all-time high: Meanwhile, these charts from the Financial Times show that the number of European tourists to the U.S. has plunged : And it's not just Europeans who are souring on the U.S. Here's an e-mail I received from Canadian reader Matthew C.: The biggest problem that the USA is facing is not the impact of tariffs, though that will be painful. Rather it is how Trump has damaged, if not destroyed the reputation of the US as a fair and honest place of business and a reliable trade partner. This has been destroyed and will take a much longer time to recover if ever. Speaking for myself and many of my other Canadian friends, we are actively searching out alternatives to American products, produce and companies. I will no longer buy a US made product if at all possible and will take my business to a company not owned by a US entity. In addition there is no hope of any of us vacationing in the US any time in the foreseeable future. This has a much more long term and lingering impact than simply tariffs and I think is massively understated and misunderstood by the US media. In his latest Week in Charts blog post, Creative Planning's Charlie Bilello shared this chart showing that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta forecasts that our GDP shrank 2.4% annualized in the first quarter : And consumer sentiment is terrible, whichever way you measure it... As Sonders shares in another post on X, only 35% of consumers expect to see real income gains during the next year – close to a quarter-century low: And courtesy of these charts from the Financial Times , here are four more negative indicators that are at their all-time worst levels : Lastly, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which dates back to 1952, has crashed to the second-lowest reading in the survey's history ( chart courtesy of Bilello's latest Week in Charts ): So why am I not telling my readers to sell everything and hold cash, which is paying a decent 4%-plus interest rate right now? First, as I've argued previously, almost all of the pain and uncertainty is self-inflicted . That means most of it can – as we saw last week – be mitigated with a social media post/announcement. And second, it's precisely when investor and consumer sentiment is the worst – and volatility is the highest – that stocks tend to do the best. Here's one example of this, showing that the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is actually a brilliant contra -indicator (chart again courtesy of Bilello's latest Week in Charts ): So do I think the S&P 500 Index is likely to rally 18.7% in the next year – the average of what it has done in the past when consumer sentiment is in the bottom 5%, as it is today? No... If you look at the chart over the past 73 years, most of the other times sentiment was so bad (mostly amid the stagflation of the 1970s and during the 2008 global financial crisis) stocks were cheap... unlike today. So investors should have modest expectations and prepare themselves for plenty more volatility and negative news flow. But my "spidey sense" isn't telling me to either buy or sell across the board , so I continue to believe that sitting tight remains the best course. Best regards, Whitney P.S.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Taking a look at Tesla in the wake of earnings April 23, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share Tesla (TSLA) is back in focus again... The electric-vehicle ("EV") maker reported first-quarter earnings after the market close yesterday, and the stock jumped as much as 9% this morning. (The full shareholder deck is here , and here's the story from the front page of today's Wall Street Journal : Tesla Profit Sinks, Hurt by Backlash Over Elon Musk's Political Role .) So today, let's take a closer look at the report and the stock's valuation... Revenue was $19.3 billion – down 9% year over year ("YOY"). Automotive revenue in particular tumbled 20% due to global vehicle deliveries falling 13% as well as heavy discounting. This was offset by a 67% YOY jump in energy generation and storage revenue, as well as a 15% increase in "services and other revenue." Meanwhile, gross margin decreased YOY from 17.4% to 16.3%, while operating expenses were up 9%. This resulted in operating income declining 66% YOY, as operating margin fell from 5.5% to 2.1%. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") fell 17% YOY, and adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") fell 40% to $0.27, missing estimates of $0.41. Note that these figures would have been worse, but Tesla redefined its adjusted earnings to exclude $97 million of mark-to-market losses in the company's bitcoin holdings in the first quarter, whereas it previously had included these gains throughout 2024 ($261 million in the first quarter last year). Tesla disclosed this in the footnotes and adjusted all prior periods to account for this sleight of hand... Operating cash flow of $2.2 billion looked good on a YOY basis – as last year's first quarter was weak, at only $242 million. And capital expenditures declined from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion YOY. That resulted in free cash flow ("FCF") rising from a $2.5 billion loss to a $664 million gain, and a slight increase in cash to about $37 billion. Reviewing Tesla's key metrics over the past three years, it's hard to see much overall growth – and the recent trends have been poor. Here are the exact tables from the shareholder deck on page 23: So why is the stock up today and pretty much flat over the past three years, as you can see in this chart? To answer this, I checked in with my analyst and longtime Tesla bull Kevin DeCamp... Regular readers will recognize Kevin's name – I frequently share his insights when it comes to Tesla and EVs. As Kevin told me in a private e-mail, the most important thing in the first quarter was an "unprecedented simultaneous changeover of the Model Y lines globally as Tesla began producing a significantly upgraded version." The Model Y car accounts for about two-thirds of Tesla's total production and was a top seller globally last year. In his e-mail to me, Kevin also noted that: As you can imagine, this meaningfully impacted Tesla's production: as the CFO mentioned in the last earnings call, "This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch, but will be overcome as production is ramped." Kevin also said that this reduced demand, as buyers waited for the upgraded model. And as he continued in his e-mail: Shockingly (or not), however, the major press outlets have been attributing Tesla's "plummeting" demand to Elon Musk's involvement with DOGE and the Trump administration – for example, see this Heard on the Street column in today's WSJ : Tesla Has a Deep Hole to Pull Out Of . This narrative is understandable given all the Tesla protests and vandalism that has occurred (by people who apparently haven't heard of Tesla's "Sentry Mode," which records their acts). Even Musk acknowledged in an interview that Tesla dealerships getting firebombed isn't good for sales – who would have thought? However, given the major changeover in lines for its highest volume product, I think it's still too early to fully assess how much brand damage Tesla has suffered. Kevin concluded by outlining why he remains bullish on the stock. He says that although the company's first quarter looked like a "financial disaster on the face of it," Tesla nailed the global Model Y transition... generated positive FCF... and has $37 billion in cash to fuel its ambitions. As he also said in his e-mail: Investors were also relieved to hear during the conference call that Musk's time allocation to DOGE, starting next month, "will drop significantly" and that Tesla's planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas in June remains on track. Combined with the continued ramp of the Model Y, these positive catalysts should help the company get back on track. The stock was up slightly in extended trading hours after the earnings release, but rallied more significantly with the rest of the market on the positive macro news related to China and the trade war. I expect the stock to continue being heavily affected by macro factors until we get more visibility on true sales trends, progress on artificial intelligence and robotics, and the success of the robotaxi rollout in Austin. And looking ahead, Kevin says that considering the significance of autonomous vehicles for Tesla's future, the second quarter could be "one of the most important of this decade." Thank you as always for your insights, Kevin! Turning to valuation... At a recent price this morning of around $256 per share and 3.5 billion diluted shares outstanding, that gives the company a market cap of roughly $896 billion and, with $30 billion of net cash, an enterprise value ("EV") of $866 billion. With trailing revenue of $95.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $15.5 billion, it's trading at about roughly 9 times EV to revenue and about 55.8 times EV to EBITDA. And with $2.11 of trailing adjusted EPS, that gives the stock a staggering price-to-earnings multiple of around 121 times . I've said many times that Tesla is a powerful company with open-ended opportunities in some of the world's largest end markets. As such, I still don't recommend shorting the stock. However, it's also light years away from a price at which I would consider buying. Rather than trying to be a hero by picking a side, you're better off sitting back and enjoying the show... Best regards, Whitney P.S. I welcome your feedback – send me an e-mail by clicking here .  Taking a look at Tesla in the wake of earnings April 23, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share Tesla (TSLA) is back in focus again... The electric-vehicle ("EV") maker reported first-quarter earnings after the market close yesterday, and the stock jumped as much as 9% this morning. (The full shareholder deck is here , and here's the story from the front page of today's Wall Street Journal : Tesla Profit Sinks, Hurt by Backlash Over Elon Musk's Political Role .) So today, let's take a closer look at the report and the stock's valuation... Revenue was $19.3 billion – down 9% year over year ("YOY"). Automotive revenue in particular tumbled 20% due to global vehicle deliveries falling 13% as well as heavy discounting. This was offset by a 67% YOY jump in energy generation and storage revenue, as well as a 15% increase in "services and other revenue." Meanwhile, gross margin decreased YOY from 17.4% to 16.3%, while operating expenses were up 9%. This resulted in operating income declining 66% YOY, as operating margin fell from 5.5% to 2.1%. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") fell 17% YOY, and adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") fell 40% to $0.27, missing estimates of $0.41. Note that these figures would have been worse, but Tesla redefined its adjusted earnings to exclude $97 million of mark-to-market losses in the company's bitcoin holdings in the first quarter, whereas it previously had included these gains throughout 2024 ($261 million in the first quarter last year). Tesla disclosed this in the footnotes and adjusted all prior periods to account for this sleight of hand... Operating cash flow of $2.2 billion looked good on a YOY basis – as last year's first quarter was weak, at only $242 million. And capital expenditures declined from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion YOY. That resulted in free cash flow ("FCF") rising from a $2.5 billion loss to a $664 million gain, and a slight increase in cash to about $37 billion. Reviewing Tesla's key metrics over the past three years, it's hard to see much overall growth – and the recent trends have been poor. Here are the exact tables from the shareholder deck on page 23: So why is the stock up today and pretty much flat over the past three years, as you can see in this chart? To answer this, I checked in with my analyst and longtime Tesla bull Kevin DeCamp... Regular readers will recognize Kevin's name – I frequently share his insights when it comes to Tesla and EVs. As Kevin told me in a private e-mail, the most important thing in the first quarter was an "unprecedented simultaneous changeover of the Model Y lines globally as Tesla began producing a significantly upgraded version."

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Uncertainty is everywhere; A disconnect between economic data and fear in the media; Be wary of Coca-Cola, Philip Morris International, and TJX Companies at these levels April 22, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) As I read the Wall Street Journal and the business section of the New York Times , I have been struck by the volume of articles regarding economic uncertainty... The underlying theme is how the turmoil triggered mainly by the Trump administration's tariff policies are creating uncertainty and resulting in cautious behavior almost everywhere. Here's an overview from the NYT : With Only Bad Options, Businesses Scramble for a Tariff Chaos Playbook . Excerpt: [Shock] is settling into reality, and corporate leaders are trying to manage. Here are the main tacks that businesses are taking – at least for now, given that whatever duties the White House declares today may change tomorrow. Move out of China, preferably yesterday Take the hit and hope it's temporary Batten down the hatches Sell fewer things Reduce, redirect, delay Raise prices, carefully Plead for mercy Here's another from the NYT noting that the impact is being felt among young Americans: Gen Z Re-evaluates Its Budgets as a Global Trade War Rages . Excerpt: Over the last two weeks, with tariffs announced, then suspended, the stock market swinging with each announcement's wake, many young adults have begun considering changing their habits around spending and saving to prepare for an uncertain economy. The NYT also notes that it's being felt among U.S. farmers: China Is Finding Ways to Replace American Farmers . Excerpt: The United States sells more soybeans to China, by value, than any other single product. Last year, that amounted to more than 27 million metric tons, worth $12.8 billion, or about 9 cents of every dollar of goods the United States sold to China. But with the enormous tariffs erected between the two countries over the past two weeks, those sales are likely to suffer soon. That is bad news for the American farmers who grow soybeans and the Chinese chicken and hog farmers who buy them – and potentially very good news for the nation ready to step in: Brazil. And as the WSJ notes, it's also among big U.S. banks: How Long Will Big U.S. Banks Continue to Lead the World? Excerpt: Last year, U.S. banks occupied the top five spots for investment-banking revenue worldwide, and were seven of the top 10, according to Dealogic. So when it comes to a global trade war, U.S. megabanks could become collateral damage. Many of Europe's champions retrenched over the past 15 years, while Chinese and Asian powerhouses have limited heft beyond their region. A long-lasting trade war could begin to change the playing field. Already, U.S. banks have reported a slowdown in dealmaking activity, with clients on pause as they wait for clarity on trade policy. The risk is that they lose even the deals that are getting done to foreign rivals they previously bested. And among advertisers (again from the NYT ): Tariff Confusion Leaves Advertisers 'Paralyzed' and 'Somber.' Excerpt: Persuading people to spend money in a time of unpredictable tariffs is proving to be a complicated calculation for the $380 billion American advertising industry... Major companies were left in the lurch this month as the administration declared new tariffs, soon imposed them, reversed course a few days later and then doubled down on targeting China. Now, those advertisers feel "paralyzed," said Jay Pattisall, a principal analyst at Forrester, a research firm. Several companies declined to elaborate on their marketing strategies for the coming months or said they were in "wait and see" mode. Finally, among sellers of luxury items (again from the WSJ ): A Weak Dollar and Record Gold Price Are More Bad News for Luxury Stocks . Excerpt: The moves are a problem for European luxury companies. Their businesses thrive when the dollar and yuan are strong and the euro is weak. High-end brands manufacture their goods in Italy and France, so their costs are in euros. But they do most of their business with Chinese and American consumers, who together generate more than half of the luxury-goods industry's sales. Keep in mind that all of these articles are just from two newspapers ... 2) Could things end well? Perhaps... As this WSJ article notes, we're not yet seeing the consequences in the economic data: Trump Is Everywhere Except in the Economic Data . Excerpt: President Trump's deportations, tariffs, federal layoffs and funding suspensions have generated nonstop headlines and frayed confidence, yet left surprisingly little trace on the economy. Hiring, spending and inflation look a lot like they did under Joe Biden. There are two possible explanations for this, one bearish, one bullish. Regarding the former, the article notes: One obvious reason for the disconnect between the headlines and the data is time lags. Trump's first tariffs, on Canada, Mexico and China, took effect March 4; tariffs on steel and aluminum followed on March 12. His much bigger 10% universal tariff and 145% tariff on China took effect in early April. Tariffs on autos took effect in early April and will take effect on parts next month. Those tariffs won't show up until April data is released, in May. High reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners have been paused. And since importers stocked up ahead of tariffs, it could be months before many newly levied tariffs get passed through to the final consumer. The foreign-born labor force could continue to swell with migrants who entered months ago, and federal employees who accepted deferred resignation could stay on the payroll until September. But as the article continues, there's a more optimistic possibility: Another explanation is that the U.S. economy is enormous. It is subject to countless influences, and actions by the president, even one as disruptive as Trump, aren't necessarily dominant. My view leans toward the former, more bearish explanation – which is why I've still been saying to sit tight (rather than broadly sell or broadly buy). But I hope to be wrong! 3) As investors flee the stocks of companies exposed to tariff risks, they're piling into stocks that are perceived to be safe harbors. But if the valuations are too high, they might not be safe at all... Consider three blue-chip stocks, beverage maker Coca-Cola (KO), cigarette seller Philip Morris International (PM), and discount retailer TJX Companies (TJX). All are great businesses and don't have significant tariff risk (Coca-Cola and Philip Morris produce their products in each country or region they operate in, and TJX sells other retailers' excess inventory). As you can see from their 10-year stock charts, all three are trading around all-time highs: But let's take a look at their valuations... At yesterday's close of $72.77 per share, KO is trading at about 24.6 times the expected earnings of $2.96 per share for this year. At $162.18 per share, PM is trading at roughly 22.4 times this year's estimates of $7.24 per share. And at $123.98 per share, TJX is trading at about 27.5 times this year's estimates of $4.51. While those aren't nosebleed valuations, I would say they're very full – certainly not bargains. I even found a bear case for Coca-Cola... This anonymous analyst posted on social platform X last week that some states are taking steps to ban the purchase of sugary drinks by low-income Americans who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (known as "SNAP," and formerly known as the Food Stamp Program), which accounts for 5% of Coca-Cola's U.S. sales: In another post, he also argues that Coca-Cola's international sales could be hurt by rising anti-American sentiment : I think this is a weak short thesis for Coca-Cola. But at these richly valued current levels, I would be wary of buying Coca-Cola, Philip Morris International, and TJX... Best regards, Whitney P.S.

In the morning, markets rallied strongly on news that President Donald Trump's administration was considering cutting the steep tariffs on China. (At one point, the S&P 500 Index was up about 3.4%.) In this article yesterday, the Wall Street Journal gave more details on the potential tariff changes: White House Considers Slashing China Tariffs to De-Escalate Trade War . Excerpt: One senior White House official said the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America's interest, some of the people said. The bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years. But markets gave back gains after White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that there would be "no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China." By the end of the day, the S&P 500 finished with a gain of about 1.7%. Small businesses in particular are hoping tariffs come down quickly because many are in the situation this one is in (from this WSJ article earlier this week: From Fake Eyelashes to Care Bears, U.S.-Bound Goods Are Stuck in Tariff Limbo ): Basic Fun, a Boca Raton, Fla.,-based seller of children's toys, has also halted shipments from China, hoping that tariffs recede to more manageable levels. The company has about two months of inventory of Lincoln Logs, Care Bears and other items in U.S. warehouses, Chief Executive Jay Foreman said. "Basically, what we're doing is eating our inventory and hoping that it will last us until this gets settled," he said. "If it doesn't, we'll be out of business." 2) The below Financial Times chart in a recent post on social platform X captures how rising bond yields and a weakening dollar could exacerbate rather than alleviate our economic difficulties . It's one of the reasons I'm particularly worried about the current situation: 3) On another note, let's check in with the latest on two companies I've previously warned readers about... First, aircraft maker Boeing (BA) reported first-quarter earnings yesterday ( earnings release here and slide presentation here ), and the stock jumped 6.1% in response. Revenue rose 18% year over year to $19.5 billion, slightly beating estimates... and its adjusted loss was $0.49 per share, much better than the loss of $1.18 forecast by analysts. But the company's numbers, while getting better, are still ugly. Take a look at the below charts from a slide in the earnings presentation: Most important to me is free cash flow ("FCF") on the right: Boeing is still burning cash, which is why net debt rose from $27.6 billion to $29.9 billion during the quarter. I can't remember the last time I invested in a turnaround situation in which a company was burning cash and had a bad balance sheet like that. And Boeing is in the crosshairs of the tariff war with China, as this WSJ article from yesterday notes: Boeing Will Stop Making Jets for China if Airlines Won't Accept Planes, CEO Says . Excerpt: The jet maker wanted to highlight financial results from its latest quarter showing that the company is emerging from its yearslong financial crisis. Instead, Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg spent much of the morning Wednesday talking about a pair of Boeing jets returned by China and issuing reassurances that tariff wars won't derail the company's turnaround. In exchanges on CNBC and on a conference call with analysts, Ortberg said that Boeing would stop making jets for China if airlines won't take the planes and that Boeing could find other buyers for jets rejected by China. He said Chinese airlines returned the planes because of high tariffs resulting from the U.S.-China trade war. Lastly, even setting aside the weak financials and tariff risk, it's not as if the stock is cheap. The company is expected to lose $2.13 per share this year and then earn $4.07 per share in 2026 and $7.45 per share in 2027. That means, at yesterday's close of $172.37 per share, the stock is trading at 42.4 times next year's earnings and 23.1 times 2027 earnings. My conclusion remains the same as when I last covered Boeing's earnings on January 29 (the stock is roughly flat since then): Ortberg appears to be making the right calls to turn things around at Boeing, but I'm still wary of the many major problems the company faces, as well as its high debt load. I continue to recommend avoiding this stock. 4) Next up is Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)... Regular readers will recall that I last wrote about the burrito chain on August 14 after coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) poached its well-respected CEO, Brian Niccol. At the time, I showed that Chipotle has been an incredible growth company and stock. Unlike Boeing, Chipotle has little tariff exposure, has a solid balance sheet, and generates high and growing FCF. Nevertheless, I warned investors in my August e-mail that: The problem is valuation. The stock is another beneficiary of the "quality bubble" I wrote about [on August 13 ]... On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, it trades at just more than 47 times this year's consensus analysts' estimates of $1.09 per share. Chipotle is a great company, but the stock's current sales and earnings multiples are ridiculous. I'd argue that 25 times this year's earnings would be a fair multiple, so I have no interest in the stock while it's anywhere close to these levels. Sure enough, as of yesterday's close, Chipotle is about 6% below where it was on August 14 (it closed that day at $51.65 per share). That isn't because the company is doing poorly – it has continued to grow nicely – but because of the high expectations built into its richly valued stock. Yesterday after the close, Chipotle reported solid first-quarter earnings : Year over year, revenue and earnings per share rose 6.4% and 7.7%, respectively. But same-store sales were down 0.4% due to a 2.3% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1.9% increase in the average check size. It was the first year-over-year quarterly decline since the pandemic, missing estimates of a 1.7% increase. And the company lowered its revenue guidance for the full year to the low-single-digit range versus previous guidance of low- to mid-single digits. These are all such small misses that, for most companies, they wouldn't affect the stock. But at yesterday's close price of $48.76 per share and earnings estimates at $1.26 per share, the stock is trading at nearly 38.7 times this year's earnings. Chipotle is a great company, but its valuation leaves no margin of safety. So as much as I would like to say the stock looks like a buy, I just can't do it... Best regards, Whitney P.S.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Latest thoughts on tariffs; Checking out Uber Technologies through my 'first look' lens April 10, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) In another wild swing, the markets had their best day since 2008 yesterday... The S&P 500 Index ripped higher by 9.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index soared 12.2%. And it all came in the wake of the Trump administration's new change to tariffs. As President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social in the early afternoon : I wasn't surprised by the news. As I wrote on April 3 : ... what we're seeing here is Trump the dealmaker. Yesterday's announcement is most likely an opening gambit to force other countries to trade with us on better terms. And recall what I said two days earlier : My gut tells me that Trump doesn't want to begin his presidency by tipping an otherwise strong economy into a recession, so he'll declare some victories and back off a bit – which could trigger a huge relief rally. But it took longer than I expected – so the damage to investor and consumer confidence was greater than I expected. As such, I no longer believe the next sentence I wrote on April 1: While I'm not outright bullish right now, I'm feeling more constructive than I was at the beginning of the year. To be clear, I'm not bearish and telling my readers to sell into yesterday's bounce... My advice for long-term investors remains the same: Sit tight. But just because Armageddon – a 2008-style financial crisis – is likely off the table doesn't mean we're in the clear. Even during a 90-day pause (and who knows what happens after that?), the tariff regime is still going to be a shock to the international system. As a smart friend of mine – a former hedge-fund manager who now posts on social media platform X anonymously under the handle BeenThereDoneThat Capital – posted yesterday in the wake of the wild rally: I'm particularly worried about the tariff battle with China because of the size of the trade between the countries, the level of tariffs, and the reality that both countries are ruled by proud, stubborn men. So compromise here will be difficult. I think the real-money bettors on Polymarket are correct that the odds of a recession this year have dropped – but only from 66% before Trump's post to around 53% earlier this morning. 2) Since I don't have a strong feeling about what's going to happen regarding tariffs, let's take a quick look at a business that's likely to be largely unaffected... Regular readers will recall that I analyzed ride-hailing service Lyft (LYFT) over three daily e-mails on two months ago on February 10 , February 11 , and February 12 – and wisely said to stay away (the stock is down 14% since then). However, I'm also interested to see the dominant company in the sector through my "first look" lens: Uber Technologies (UBER)... Uber went public at $45 per share on May 10, 2019, giving it a valuation greater than $80 billion. That was much too high... and three years later, after much volatility, the stock was down by about 50% – largely matching Lyft's equally dismal performance over the same period. But since then, the stocks have completely diverged... Lyft's stock has fallen another roughly 50%. Meanwhile, Uber's stock has more than tripled – to the point where it has almost caught up to the S&P 500's performance since the initial public offering ("IPO") date. You can see the moves in the chart below: Why has the stock recovered? Simple: Uber has shown huge revenue growth and has started to make money on an operating profit basis (I use operating income because net income is distorted by noncash tax gains and losses): The story from the cash-flow statement is even more impressive. Free cash flow ("FCF") has exploded – going from negative territory as recently as 2021 to hitting $6.9 billion last year. The chart below shows the historical operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: Well, a quick initial look like this at the financials seems promising. But of course, valuation is a big question. After jumping 11.7% yesterday to close at $72.68 per share, that gave the company a roughly $152 billion market cap. With projections for earnings per share of $2.43 this year, that would give the stock a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 30 times. That's too high a price for me. But there's an even bigger reason why I'm avoiding Uber... the threat from Waymo and other self-driving vehicle services. In fact, my team and I discussed this risk when we listed Uber and Lyft as "doomed AI victims" in a special report for Stansberry's Investment Advisory subscribers last August. (I cited some parts of the report in my February 11 e-mail .) Investment Advisory subscribers can read the full report here: Dead Men Walking: 10 Doomed Companies in the Crosshairs of AI .

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Corporations' outlooks are getting worse; A big fall in home sales; Looking into earnings reports from Alphabet and Intel April 25, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) Another day with more grim headlines and negativity about the economy ... Many corporations are cutting back and suspending guidance amid an uncertain outlook. An article on the front page of today's Wall Street Journal specifically mentioned the CEOs of American Airlines (AAL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Procter & Gamble (PG) – among other big firms – warning about how the changing tariff situation makes it "virtually impossible to plan." Here's the article: Corporate Giants Shred Outlooks Over Tariff Uncertainty ... And here are more details in this excerpt: American, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air Group told investors and analysts that leisure travel had already softened and pulled their full-year outlooks because the economic climate makes it too tough to forecast. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it was considering raising prices on some items. And auto-industry groups representing General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota sent a letter to President [Donald] Trump imploring him to reconsider the 25% tariff on car parts that goes into effect May 3, because it will make buying and repairing cars and trucks more expensive... As the article also notes, executives like Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon and Virgin founder Richard Branson have sounded the alarm about potential damage to the economy from the tariffs. 2) Meanwhile, another new WSJ article highlighted another area in which consumers are pulling back: buying houses. As the article ( Home Sales in March Fell 5.9%, Biggest Drop Since 2022 ) notes: U.S. existing-home sales fell 5.9% in March from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That marked the biggest month-over-month decline since November 2022. It was also the slowest sales pace for any March since 2009, which was near the peak of the financial crisis... But with home prices near record highs and mortgage rates holding above 6.5%, buyers are being choosy. That is setting the stage for potentially a third straight year of anemic sales activity, after sales fell in 2023 and 2024 to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. I continue to monitor economic trends, and I remain cautiously optimistic that the Trump administration will back down from some of its most drastic tariff threats. But I don't feel like I have an edge in these areas. However, where I do have an edge is analyzing individual companies and stocks, so let's take a look at earnings reports for two of them... 3) I've consistently been bullish on Google and YouTube parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ever since I named it as a core holding in my old firm Empire Financial Research's first newsletter on April 17, 2019. Since then, through yesterday's close, it's up 157% versus 89% for the S&P 500 Index. Alphabet released first-quarter earnings yesterday, so let's take a look... (You can see the full earnings release here and the slide presentation here .) The company reported $90.2 billion in revenue – up 12% (14% in constant currency) year over year ("YOY") and about $1 billion above estimates. Google Cloud revenue was $12.3 billion, up a robust 28% YOY – but that's a slowdown from previous quarters. Alphabet did an excellent job controlling expenses, which only rose 8% YOY. So the company's operating margin grew from 32% to 34% YOY, and operating income jumped 20%. Diluted shares declined 2% thanks to $61.6 billion worth of share repurchases in the past 12 months. As a result, earnings per share came in at $2.81, up an exceptional 49% YOY and crushing estimates of $2.01. It's incredible that a company of this size – with trailing 12-month revenue of $360 billion – can keep growing this quickly and this profitably. Overall, it was a great quarter across multiple metrics. And the stock is responding today – it jumped as much as 4% in morning trading. But it's still down quite a bit from the all-time high it hit in early February, as you can see in this three-year chart: As this WSJ article, Google's Earnings Power Holds Up in Global Turbulence , notes: Google doesn't issue financial projections with its quarterly reports, which leaves it unclear just how its business was affected by President Trump's April 2 announcement of high tariffs, and the turbulence that has followed amid the ever-changing status of those tariffs. On the company's earnings call Thursday, Google's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said it is "too early to comment" on trends for the current quarter. And as the article continues: Most of Google's business isn't directly affected by tariffs on foreign goods, but the company draws a lot of advertising and cloud revenue from companies that are affected. This fed a lot of worries ahead of Google's report; UBS analysts predicted in a report earlier this month that "budget commitments particularly for advertising will remain frozen." Schindler would only say that he expects a "slight headwind" to Google's advertising business from changes to the so-called de minimis rule, which once allowed goods priced below a certain threshold to avoid tariffs. Finally, let's look at Alphabet's valuation... At a recent price this morning of around $165 per share, the stock trades at 17.7 times this year's earnings estimates of $9.31 per share (which will undoubtedly be going up after the company's big earnings beat). That's slightly below the 18.1 times forward multiple of the S&P 500 today. Even prior to the solid earnings, Alphabet recently boasted the lowest price-to-earnings multiple among the "Magnificent Seven" mega-cap stocks. Take a look at this chart (courtesy of the recent Week in Charts blog post from Creative Planning's Charlie Bilello), which shows how these metrics stood late last week (using trailing earnings): While I recognize that Alphabet's business would be affected by a trade war and recession, I think this possibility is mostly built into the stock price. It makes no sense that one of the greatest businesses of all time trades at a lower multiple than the average large U.S. business. My view today – as it has been for more than six years – is that Alphabet is a great stock for conservative, long-term-oriented investors. 4) Up next is Intel (INTC)... Regular readers will recall that I wrote about the long-struggling chip giant Intel on September 6 , September 9 , and December 9 last year. And then, most recently this year, I discussed the company on March 17 , when it closed at $25.69 per share on optimism about the new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. But as I concluded in that e-mail: I would continue to remain on the sidelines based on Intel's balance sheet and cash-flow statement. It has been a good call so far... Through yesterday's close, Intel is down 16% since March 17. And the stock tumbled as much as 10% this morning to less than $20 per share after the company reported another weak quarter (you can see the full earnings release here and the slide presentation here ). This WSJ article has more details: Intel Cuts Outlook, Says Layoffs Are in Store . Excerpt: The company posted a quarterly loss on Thursday and gave a weak revenue outlook. It said it would lower its operating expense target this year by $500 million and would reduce it by a further $1 billion next year. Tan said in a letter to employees that layoffs would start this quarter and continue over several months, although he didn't quantify how many employees would be affected. The company also is reducing its gross capital spending target by $2 billion this year to $18 billion, reflecting a slowdown in a gigantic manufacturing expansion undertaken by Tan's predecessor, Pat Gelsinger. Regarding tariffs, the article continues: Finance chief David Zinsner said tariffs were affecting the company in two ways. Customers rushed to buy electronics in anticipation of the tariffs, contributing to higher-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. Looking ahead, though, he said costs would increase and the market would contract as consumers and businesses face an uncertain economy. And as the article also notes, Intel's revenue last quarter beat guidance, but its forecast lagged: Intel's revenue was flat in its first quarter at $12.7 billion, above analyst expectations according to FactSet. It reported an $821 million loss, wider than the $381 million loss posted in last year's first quarter. It was the fifth consecutive quarterly loss, the longest streak since at least 1990... Intel also gave a forecast of roughly $11.8 billion in revenue for its current quarter, lower than Wall Street forecasts of around $12.8 billion. As I commented in yesterday's e-mail regarding aircraft maker Boeing (BA) , "I can't remember the last time I invested in a turnaround situation in which a company was burning cash and had a bad balance sheet." Intel last quarter generated only $813 million of operating cash flow and had capital expenditures of about $5.2 billion, meaning it had negative free cash flow of about $4.4 billion. As a result, net debt rose during the quarter from $27.8 billion to $29.1 billion. Until there's real evidence of a turnaround, I would continue to stay away from this stock – which sits close to a 10-year low: If Tan is able to engineer a turnaround, there will be plenty of time to get into the stock... even if that means missing the first move upward.

Corporations' outlooks are getting worse; A big fall in home sales; Looking into earnings reports from Alphabet and Intel April 25, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) Another day with more grim headlines and negativity about the economy ... Many corporations are cutting back and suspending guidance amid an uncertain outlook. An article on the front page of today's Wall Street Journal specifically mentioned the CEOs of American Airlines (AAL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Procter & Gamble (PG) – among other big firms – warning about how the changing tariff situation makes it "virtually impossible to plan." Here's the article: Corporate Giants Shred Outlooks Over Tariff Uncertainty ... And here are more details in this excerpt: American, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air Group told investors and analysts that leisure travel had already softened and pulled their full-year outlooks because the economic climate makes it too tough to forecast. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it was considering raising prices on some items. And auto-industry groups representing General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota sent a letter to President [Donald] Trump imploring him to reconsider the 25% tariff on car parts that goes into effect May 3, because it will make buying and repairing cars and trucks more expensive... As the article also notes, executives like Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon and Virgin founder Richard Branson have sounded the alarm about potential damage to the economy from the tariffs. 2) Meanwhile, another new WSJ article highlighted another area in which consumers are pulling back: buying houses. As the article ( Home Sales in March Fell 5.9%, Biggest Drop Since 2022 ) notes: U.S. existing-home sales fell 5.9% in March from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That marked the biggest month-over-month decline since November 2022. It was also the slowest sales pace for any March since 2009, which was near the peak of the financial crisis... But with home prices near record highs and mortgage rates holding above 6.5%, buyers are being choosy. That is setting the stage for potentially a third straight year of anemic sales activity, after sales fell in 2023 and 2024 to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. I continue to monitor economic trends, and I remain cautiously optimistic that the Trump administration will back down from some of its most drastic tariff threats. But I don't feel like I have an edge in these areas. However, where I do have an edge is analyzing individual companies and stocks, so let's take a look at earnings reports for two of them... 3) I've consistently been bullish on Google and YouTube parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ever since I named it as a core holding in my old firm Empire Financial Research's first newsletter on April 17, 2019. Since then, through yesterday's close, it's up 157% versus 89% for the S&P 500 Index. Alphabet released first-quarter earnings yesterday, so let's take a look... (You can see the full earnings release here and the slide presentation here .) The company reported $90.2 billion in revenue – up 12% (14% in constant currency) year over year ("YOY") and about $1 billion above estimates. Google Cloud revenue was $12.3 billion, up a robust 28% YOY – but that's a slowdown from previous quarters. Alphabet did an excellent job controlling expenses, which only rose 8% YOY. So the company's operating margin grew from 32% to 34% YOY, and operating income jumped 20%. Diluted shares declined 2% thanks to $61.6 billion worth of share repurchases in the past 12 months. As a result, earnings per share came in at $2.81, up an exceptional 49% YOY and crushing estimates of $2.01.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free My focus amid the evolving tariff situation; Hat tip to Warren Buffett; Thoughts on Apple's stock at these levels; A mysterious gambler 'took down the Texas lottery' to win nearly $60 million April 14, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) As you would no doubt expect by now, the tariff details keep changing... Late on Friday, it appeared that President Donald Trump's administration was exempting a range of Chinese-made electronic products like iPhones from its 145% tariffs. And that could – at least temporarily – benefit companies that manufacture certain electronic devices outside the U.S. This Wall Street Journal article from yesterday has more details: Shifting Signals on Tech Tariffs Fuel Fresh Trade Uncertainty . Excerpt: The exemptions, if they remain, signal that for now, smartphones, chips and other devices won't face tariffs at the same rate currently imposed on goods imported from China. As the U.S. and China subsequently raised tariffs on each other's products in rapid succession, Apple was among the companies with the most at stake because it makes most of its devices in China. Exemptions would also mark an initial victory for the tech industry in the new Trump administration. Executives flocked to Mar-a-Lago after Trump was elected and donated millions to his inauguration. So far, their efforts hadn't resulted in many public victories. Many of the companies continue to face antitrust cases and are lobbying for favorable artificial-intelligence regulation. But then yesterday afternoon, President Trump posted this on Truth Social – saying that a tariff exception wasn't announced on Friday: Meanwhile, as that same WSJ article notes, there are still huge uncertainties: "The turmoil of this tariff roller coaster is going to continue to have negative effects," said Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute think tank focused on technology and innovation. He hopes the exemptions were a signal that the administration is pulling back from extreme policies. Thierer and other experts have warned that tariffs on tech products would undermine the U.S. in its artificial-intelligence race with China... Neel Kashkari, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said Sunday prospects of a recession will be determined by whether there are "quick resolutions" to trade uncertainties with major trading partners. He pointed to recent declines in consumer confidence as troubling. "This is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when Covid first hit," he said. "So when there is that kind of hit to confidence it can have large effects on the economy." I wish I could tell you with confidence how the tariff wars, especially with China, are going to play out, but I can't. (And I'm skeptical of anyone who claims to have a good crystal ball.) So I'm going to focus on what I do know how to do: analyze companies and wait for fat pitches. 2) You have to tip your hat to Warren Buffett for building a huge $334 billion cash pile – equal to 28.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-B) assets – at exactly the right time... Regular readers will recall that I discussed this in my February 25 analysis of Berkshire's latest earnings report . That huge amount of cash – and the fact that the company's businesses aren't as affected by tariffs as other firms – helps explain why the stock is only down about 3% from its all-time high. As usual, Berkshire's stock is a safe harbor in a storm – which is one of the reasons I like it so much. I wish I could recommend buying it right now... but it remains slightly overvalued, as I discussed in my March 3 e-mail . (That said, I think it's a comfortable hold for long-term-oriented investors.) 3) Berkshire's primary exposure to tariffs was through its holding in Apple (AAPL), but Buffett has wisely been selling it down. I applauded the decision in my November 4 e-mail , writing: I've said previously that I think this has been a good sale, for risk management and diversification. In addition, I still believe it will likely be difficult for Apple's stock to outperform going forward for three main reasons: The company is so large ($391 billion in revenue) that growth becomes increasingly difficult. With a $3.4 trillion market cap (as of Friday's close), share repurchases won't move the needle as much. As of Friday's close, the valuation is high. At 36.7 times trailing earnings and 30.2 times next 12 month expected earnings, it's close to the highest level in 16 years. Apple's stock is down nearly 11% since then... so might it be interesting now? I was thinking about this as I read a pair of articles over the weekend about the company... The first, in the New York Times , is quite bearish. It highlights a lack of innovation and successful new products, among other issues: What's Wrong With Apple? Excerpt: Even before President Trump's tariffs threatened to upend Apple's manufacturing business in China, the company's struggle to make new products was leading some people inside its lavish Silicon Valley headquarters to wonder whether the company had somehow lost its magic. The tariffs, which were introduced April 2, caused Apple to lose $773 billion in market capitalization in four days and briefly lose its standing as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But investors had already started to sour on the company, sending its share price down 8 percent in the first four months of the year, double the S&P 500's decline. And as the article continues: Apple had hoped to revive its fortunes over the past year with a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, and an artificial intelligence system called Apple Intelligence. Sales of the headset have been a disappointment, however, and the signature features of the A.I. system have been postponed because it didn't work as well as the company had expected. The company's issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. The other article, in the WSJ , is more positive. It notes how well CEO Tim Cook has guided the company over time: Tim Cook's 'Long Arc of Time' Prepared Apple for the Trade War . Excerpt: The iPhone is exempt from the White House's latest escalation of the trade war with China, the Trump administration quietly announced late Friday. The disclosure came after more than a week of existential dread. At one point, Apple had lost almost $800 billion of market value after Trump officials claimed imposing sky-high tariffs on Chinese-made goods would shift iPhone assembly to American factories. Meanwhile, the article notes that Cook and Trump "seem to be playing a different game": Trump was forced to backpedal by the quickly eroding stock and bond markets – his go-to measure of public support. Meanwhile, Cook looked toward the "long arc of time" – his go-to guide in a world where investors and customers constantly agitate for what's coming next for Apple, have little patience and judge the chief executive on a quarterly basis. That doesn't mean that for a brief moment things didn't look really, really bad for Apple – or could get messy again, with the Trump administration on Sunday suggesting the reprieve might be temporary. Apple is down about 24% from its all-time high near $260 per share in December. But in light of the massive new tariff risk (and its nosebleed valuation at the time), I think the stock should be down closer to 50%. At Friday's close of $198.15 per share, it's trading at about 27.3 times analysts' earnings estimates of $7.26 per share for this year – and I think those estimates are at high risk right now. Apple is such a great company that the stock will probably do fine... but I wouldn't be tempted at the stock's current level. 4) Finally, another article over the weekend in the WSJ caught my eye not just because it's a crazy story... It also underscores the importance of casting a wide net, looking at a lot of opportunities, but only actually taking action rarely – when the odds are highly favorable: How a Secretive Gambler Called 'The Joker' Took Down the Texas Lottery . As the article explains, it started in spring 2023. At the time, a banker-turned-bookmaker in London named Bernard Marantelli had a plan to clean up on the Texas lottery: He and his partners would buy nearly every possible number in a coming drawing. There were 25.8 million potential number combinations. The tickets were $1 apiece. The jackpot was heading to $95 million. If nobody else also picked the winning numbers, the profit would be nearly $60 million. And as the article continues, a secretive gambler named Zeljko Ranogajec – nicknamed "the Joker" – helped bankroll the operation: Over the years, Ranogajec and his partners have won hundreds of millions of dollars by applying Wall Street-style analytics to betting opportunities around the world. Like card counters at a blackjack table, they use data and math to hunt for situations ripe for flipping the house edge in their favor. Then they throw piles of money at it, betting an estimated $10 billion annually. The Texas lottery play, one of their most ambitious operations ever, paid off spectacularly with a $57.8 million jackpot win... Best regards, Whitney P.S.

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Consumer spending remains strong; Struggles at LVMH; A 'first look' at Hasbro April 17, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) While consumer sentiment is poor , consumer spending – which accounts for nearly 70% of our GDP – remains strong. That's according to a couple measures... The first is the government's retail sales report for March – just take a look at this chart from Creative Planning's Charlie Bilello in a post yesterday on social platform X : The second is what large banks had to say when they reported earnings recently. The Wall Street Journal has more details in this article from this week: Big Banks Show Consumers Remained Resilient Heading Into Tariff Turmoil . Excerpt: Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) said Tuesday consumer spending ticked higher in the first quarter when concerns about tariffs and the economy began to bubble up. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said last week that credit- and debit-card spending rose. Executives also said spending has largely held up in the weeks after the quarter ended, even after President Trump sharply escalated his tariff threats on "Liberation Day." JPMorgan noted some of that might have been people making purchases in advance of price increases from tariffs. "This is consumers continuing to spend, and that is ultimately the basis of the U.S. economy," said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America's chief financial officer, on a call with reporters Tuesday. "The signals at this point from the consumer are that the U.S. economy still remains in good shape." I want to flag this sentence: "JPMorgan noted some of that might have been people making purchases in advance of price increases from tariffs." That's the key question: Is consumer spending about to fall off a cliff? I doubt it, but I'll be keeping a close eye on this... 2) The WSJ also had a quick update on French luxury-goods giant LVMH (MC.PA), which reported disappointing first-quarter sales on Monday: Louis Vuitton's Owner Looks Down-at-Heel Even Before Tariffs Hit . Excerpt: LVMH's latest sales figures show Chinese and U.S. demand for luxury goods was wobbly – even before the trade war between the two countries kicked off in earnest. The disappointing start to the year is a bad omen for the industry, and things are likely to get worse as the effects of tariffs ripple through markets and economies. Shares in Louis Vuitton's owner sank Tuesday, after the company said sales fell 3% over the three months through March compared with a year earlier. The stock dropped 7.8% in Paris. Regular readers will recall that I've written about LVMH five times in recent months: My first look at LVMH and Pernod Ricard (November 14, 2024) A deeper look at LVMH (part 1) (November 21, 2024) A deeper look at LVMH (part 2) (November 22, 2024) Updates on LVMH, Lululemon Athletica, and Five Below (January 17, 2025) Bad news for the luxury market in China (February 20, 2025) I'm glad I didn't pound the table on it... In the wake of the disappointing earnings report, the stock not only hit a 52-week low but nearly a five-year low yesterday. Take a look at this chart: I would love to say it's now a great time to buy... but the stock still trades at 20 times this year's earnings estimates – and I think those estimates are at high risk due to a possible recession and trade war with China. 3) I had similar concerns about leading toy-maker Mattel (MAT) , which I analyzed in yesterday's e-mail. Given that the company sources roughly 40% of what it sells from China, the stock wasn't even close to being cheap enough to be interesting. Today, let's take a look at another leading toy-maker – Hasbro (HAS), which also sources a similar percentage of its products from China. It's known for the Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Play-Doh, Nerf, and Star Wars licenses. Hasbro's stock has done better than Mattel's over the past 20 years, though that's not saying much – and it's down by nearly 60% from its pre-COVID highs. You can see movement in the chart below: Turning to revenue and net income over the past 20 years... Hasbro had a positive trend over the first roughly dozen years and had recovered strongly after a pandemic-era dip. But revenue has declined significantly in the past three years (note that 2023 net income is an estimate, adjusted for noncash goodwill and sale-of-asset charges). Here's the chart: While it hasn't shown much growth, Hasbro has generated consistent free cash flow ("FCF") over the past two decades – with a nice increase over the past two years. Take a look at this next chart of the company's operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: Hasbro has (wisely) scaled back its share repurchases but continues to pay a steady dividend – it currently yields about 5.4%, which costs the company just under $400 million annually. Hasbro easily covers this with its free cash flow, which has averaged about $626 million over the past five years. So why did net debt surge suddenly surge a few years ago? That's because Hasbro had completed a large acquisition of Entertainment One (eOne) at the end of 2019, a Canadian media and entertainment company: It was a stinker of a deal, however... and in August 2023, Hasbro announced the sale of eOne's film and television business to Lionsgate for $500 million and took nearly $2 billion in write-offs. Today, the company remains saddled with $2.8 billion of net debt. That isn't a dangerous amount in light of current cash flows... but it constrains Hasbro's ability to do things like buy back stock. Lastly, valuation... At yesterday's closing price of $51.88, the company has a nearly $7.3 billion market cap and, adding net debt, an enterprise value near $10.1 billion. With expectations for Hasbro to earn $4.18 per share this year, the company is trading at about 12.4 times earnings – quite a premium to the ratio of roughly 8.7 times that Mattel is trading at (likely due mostly to Hasbro's high dividend). But like Mattel and other stocks I've discussed this week – Apple (AAPL) on Monday and LVMH above – I'm skeptical of the earnings numbers for companies whose businesses have significant exposure China. While both sides may back down from their 100%-plus tariff threats, even much lower tariffs would materially affect profits... as I don't think Hasbro and Mattel have much pricing power. Like Mattel, I think Hasbro's stock should be down closer to 50% this year in light of the recession and tariff risks... but instead, it's only down 7% through yesterday's close. It has actually done better than the S&P 500 Index, which is down about 10% this year. That makes no sense. As such, I would remain on the sidelines with Hasbro. I'm also interested in reviewing the company's first-quarter earnings report, which is scheduled for release next Thursday. On a final note today, the markets and our offices are closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday... so look for my next daily e-mail on Monday. Have a good weekend, and Happy Easter!

"This is consumers continuing to spend, and that is ultimately the basis of the U.S. economy," said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America's chief financial officer, on a call with reporters Tuesday. "The signals at this point from the consumer are that the U.S. economy still remains in good shape." I want to flag this sentence: "JPMorgan noted some of that might have been people making purchases in advance of price increases from tariffs." That's the key question: Is consumer spending about to fall off a cliff? I doubt it, but I'll be keeping a close eye on this... 2) The WSJ also had a quick update on French luxury-goods giant LVMH (MC.PA), which reported disappointing first-quarter sales on Monday: Louis Vuitton's Owner Looks Down-at-Heel Even Before Tariffs Hit . Excerpt: LVMH's latest sales figures show Chinese and U.S. demand for luxury goods was wobbly – even before the trade war between the two countries kicked off in earnest. The disappointing start to the year is a bad omen for the industry, and things are likely to get worse as the effects of tariffs ripple through markets and economies. Shares in Louis Vuitton's owner sank Tuesday, after the company said sales fell 3% over the three months through March compared with a year earlier. The stock dropped 7.8% in Paris. Regular readers will recall that I've written about LVMH five times in recent months: My first look at LVMH and Pernod Ricard (November 14, 2024) A deeper look at LVMH (part 1) (November 21, 2024) A deeper look at LVMH (part 2) (November 22, 2024) Updates on LVMH, Lululemon Athletica, and Five Below (January 17, 2025) Bad news for the luxury market in China (February 20, 2025) I'm glad I didn't pound the table on it... In the wake of the disappointing earnings report, the stock not only hit a 52-week low but nearly a five-year low yesterday. Take a look at this chart: I would love to say it's now a great time to buy... but the stock still trades at 20 times this year's earnings estimates – and I think those estimates are at high risk due to a possible recession and trade war with China. 3) I had similar concerns about leading toy-maker Mattel (MAT) , which I analyzed in yesterday's e-mail. Given that the company sources roughly 40% of what it sells from China, the stock wasn't even close to being cheap enough to be interesting. Today, let's take a look at another leading toy-maker – Hasbro (HAS), which also sources a similar percentage of its products from China. It's known for the Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Play-Doh, Nerf, and Star Wars licenses. Hasbro's stock has done better than Mattel's over the past 20 years, though that's not saying much – and it's down by nearly 60% from its pre-COVID highs. You can see movement in the chart below: Turning to revenue and net income over the past 20 years... Hasbro had a positive trend over the first roughly dozen years and had recovered strongly after a pandemic-era dip. But revenue has declined significantly in the past three years (note that 2023 net income is an estimate, adjusted for noncash goodwill and sale-of-asset charges). Here's the chart: While it hasn't shown much growth, Hasbro has generated consistent free cash flow ("FCF") over the past two decades – with a nice increase over the past two years. Take a look at this next chart of the company's operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: Hasbro has (wisely) scaled back its share repurchases but continues to pay a steady dividend – it currently yields about 5.4%, which costs the company just under $400 million annually. Hasbro easily covers this with its free cash flow, which has averaged about $626 million over the past five years. So why did net debt surge suddenly surge a few years ago? That's because Hasbro had completed a large acquisition of Entertainment One (eOne) at the end of 2019, a Canadian media and entertainment company: It was a stinker of a deal, however... and in August 2023, Hasbro announced the sale of eOne's film and television business to Lionsgate for $500 million and took nearly $2 billion in write-offs. Today, the company remains saddled with $2.8 billion of net debt. That isn't a dangerous amount in light of current cash flows... but it constrains Hasbro's ability to do things like buy back stock. Lastly, valuation... At yesterday's closing price of $51.88, the company has a nearly $7.3 billion market cap and, adding net debt, an enterprise value near $10.1 billion. With expectations for Hasbro to earn $4.18 per share this year, the company is trading at about 12.4 times earnings – quite a premium to the ratio of roughly 8.7 times that Mattel is trading at (likely due mostly to Hasbro's high dividend). But like Mattel and other stocks I've discussed this week – Apple (AAPL) on Monday and LVMH above – I'm skeptical of the earnings numbers for companies whose businesses have significant exposure China. While both sides may back down from their 100%-plus tariff threats, even much lower tariffs would materially affect profits... as I don't think Hasbro and Mattel have much pricing power. Like Mattel, I think Hasbro's stock should be down closer to 50% this year in light of the recession and tariff risks... but instead, it's only down 7% through yesterday's close. It has actually done better than the S&P 500 Index, which is down about 10% this year. That makes no sense. As such, I would remain on the sidelines with Hasbro. I'm also interested in reviewing the company's first-quarter earnings report, which is scheduled for release next Thursday. On a final note today, the markets and our offices are closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday... so look for my next daily e-mail on Monday. Have a good weekend, and Happy Easter!

Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free  Our Products Our Editors Media Log In Sign Up Free Six ideas to help calm 'money anxiety'; The two types of opportunities I'm looking for; A first look at Mattel April 16, 2025 | Whitney Tilson's Daily | Whitney Tilson Share 1) Compared with what we saw last week, the markets have been quieter over the past couple days... And I don't want to cause more stress among my readers by sharing more bearish indicators (believe me, there are plenty). So instead, I'll highlight this New York Times article from last weekend that has some good advice: How to Ease Your Money Anxiety When the Economy Is Stressing You Out . As the article notes, even before the economic chaos this year, folks' financial anxiety was already running high: Four out of five Americans in a survey for Discover last year said they were worried about their money situation, with inflation, everyday expenses and the state of the economy leading a litany of concerns. Nearly two-thirds said they would be financially unprepared if they lost their job, and more than half felt the same way about a recession. Now, tariffs and a global trade war, which could raise prices and discourage consumer and corporate spending, have economists raising their odds of such a downturn this year. Coupled with wild swings in the stock market, which is down about 9 percent for the year, it's no wonder that financial anxiety is spiking to new heights. The article echoes what I've been saying in my e-mails recently – sit tight and don't make decisions when you're scared: "The urge people feel to do something to make themselves feel better can be overwhelming," said Anne Lester, former head of retirement solutions for J.P. Morgan Asset Management and author of the book "Your Best Financial Life." "But it's hard to make sound decisions when you're scared." Instead, the article shares six smart strategies: "Adjust your perspective." ("Stocks still look like a smart investment for long-term growth.") "Slow your roll." ("Pause and be thoughtful and take time on decisions rather than reacting on emotion.") "Don't look at your balances. (Really, don't.)" ("Investors with long-term goals who rarely check their accounts end up earning significantly higher returns on average than those who monitor more often.") "Imagine the worst." ("Identifying your biggest fear about your financial situation now, then thinking about how you'd manage the fallout, can be a calming exercise.") "Identify one move." ("Focus on what you can control, especially actions that could improve your financial situation in a downturn.") "Practice self-compassion." ("Tell yourself, 'I did the best with what I knew at the time.'") 2) Regarding No. 5, "Identify one move," the one move I'm always looking to make – and share first with my subscribers and then readers of this free e-mail – during times of turmoil is identifying a great stock to buy. I'm generally looking in two places... The first is among high-quality businesses that aren't affected by, or might even benefit from, the tariff turmoil. A good example is CME Group (CME). It provides electronic trading globally for futures and options – just the kind of business that does well when investors (I use that term loosely – the correct word for most of them is "speculators") are panicked and trading like maniacs. No wonder the stock (as of yesterday's close) is up more than 13% this year and is trading within a few percentage points of its all-time high. I'll also note that my team recommended it in our flagship Stansberry's Investment Advisory newsletter back in January 2023. Subscribers who followed the advice to buy the stock in that monthly issue are up 67%. (If you're an Investment Advisory subscriber, you can read the full write-up by my colleague Alan Gula right here . If you aren't, find out how to become one – plus access our entire archive, full portfolio of open recommendations and specific advice on positions, and receive our next 12 monthly issues that will each have our best current idea – by clicking here .) The other type of stock I'm looking for is a good company whose stock has been crushed by fears about tariffs. And therefore, this kind of stock could soar if President Donald Trump ends up cutting deals – especially with China. 3) Along these lines, this article by CNBC recently caught my eye: Mattel and Hasbro stocks notch new lows after Trump's China tariff escalation . Excerpt: The toy industry is heavily reliant on supply chains in China, leaving toy makers at the mercy of trade policy. Bank of America estimates that both Mattel and Hasbro source around 40% of their U.S. product from China... Margins for toys are typically in the high single digits, meaning there's little wiggle room for companies to absorb the cost of these new fees. Expectations are that toy companies will need to pass on the entire cost of Trump's tariffs to the consumer through higher prices on the shelf. These price hikes, which could see some toy product double in cost, is set to coincide with this year's back-to-school season. So to wrap up today, I'll take my usual "first look" at Mattel (MAT). It makes numerous well-known brands of toys – including Barbie, Hot Wheels, American Girl, Fisher-Price, and Disney Princess. Despite this, the stock has been a dismal performer, having actually declined over the past two decades: In light of this, I wasn't surprised to see that revenue and profits have also been essentially flat over the past two decades: Mattel's free cash flow ("FCF") has been consistently positive – other than two bad years in 2017 and 2018 – but hasn't grown much overall. Take a look at this chart of the company's operating cash flow, capital expenditures ("capex"), and FCF: Meanwhile, Mattel's capital allocation has been all over the map... This next chart shows the various acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends through 2017... then nothing for a couple years... then small but growing share repurchases in the past few years: The balance sheet is decent, with the company paying down debt over the past five years: Lastly, as of yesterday's close, Mattel has a market cap of about $4.8 billion. And with roughly $1.3 billion of net debt, that gives it an enterprise value of about $6.1 billion. The stock closed yesterday at $14.92 per share. And with expectations for the company to earn $1.68 per share this year (up slightly from last year's figure of $1.62), that means it's trading at about 8.9 times this year's earnings. That's a low multiple. But I think it's delusional to think that Mattel's earnings are going to grow this year, in light of the slowing economy and then adding in the catastrophic tail risk of tariffs. And yet, the stock is only down about 16% this year. I think it should be down closer to 50% ... so I wouldn't even be slightly tempted by Mattel's stock at these levels. If tariffs kick in, the company starts losing money, and the stock gets cut in half – a very realistic scenario – then it might look more appealing for bottom-fishing. Might Hasbro provide a better opportunity? I'll take a look tomorrow... Stay tuned! Best regards, Whitney P.S. I welcome your feedback – send me an e-mail by clicking here .
