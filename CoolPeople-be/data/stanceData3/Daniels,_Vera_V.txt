      here is how this would be done. Important: No " " required. Must have "()" around contributor name. No spaces after ":" Notes You can try constructing a search query and hitting "Search" in the top "Advanced Search" section
      and then coming "back" to this section to copy that query into the "Query:" box. "downloads" is the number of downloads for content in an item "month" is the number of downloads in the last 30 days "week" is the number of downloads in the last 7 days We have a known bug in our site with using " TO " in things like titles/descriptions .
      If you run into a problem and need to use " TO ",
      use it lowercase and you will avoid this bug.

Then, after it takes a while, I get a Ã¢ÂÂfailedÃ¢ÂÂ notification, at least thatÃ¢ÂÂs what itÃ¢ÂÂs been doing lately. Like most everyone else, I donÃ¢ÂÂt quite understand the purpose of this app. IÃ¢ÂÂm saving pages for the heck of it but donÃ¢ÂÂt see how the app is supposed to help me enjoy them. In addition, itÃ¢ÂÂs buggy. YouÃ¢ÂÂd think that a great and essential website such as the archive, our main keepers of web history, would offer an app up to par with it but thatÃ¢ÂÂs not the case here at all.   fydvn , Confusing The Internet Archive app was and still is difficult for me to navigate. For example, after finding a particular show on Google that led me to the archives, and so I created an account. At that time I was able to watch what I had found and add it to Ã¢ÂÂmy favoritesÃ¢ÂÂ. Later on, I downloaded the app. I tried logging in, and it said that I have an account but Ã¢ÂÂmy favoritesÃ¢ÂÂ arenÃ¢ÂÂt there. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no option to find them either. However, I have google on my fire stick and was able to access it there, along with my favorites. So, itÃ¢ÂÂs very confusing. As with other reviewers, I agree there should be other input options other than only being able to use the URL. Also, 2 days after having Ã¢ÂÂmy favoritesÃ¢ÂÂ saved and able to watch a few, as of today, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a video error and those Ã¢ÂÂfilesÃ¢ÂÂ will no longer play. None of them and I canÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂfavoriteÃ¢ÂÂ them either. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what kind of glitch that is, but I believe IÃ¢ÂÂd you work out those minor Ã¢ÂÂbugsÃ¢ÂÂ, the app would be great. Not too shabby for now though, great start.   Yowzoe , 5 Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¯Â¸Â potential, but...Ã°ÂÂ¤Â please updateÃ¢ÂÂ¼Ã¯Â¸Â The Archive has enough talented admirers to improve the two IA apps. Improving them is long overdue. Everyone loves the Internet Archive and the incredible effort that goes into it. It's indispensable for students and lovers of knowledge the world over. It greatly expands access to knowledge and keeps liars at bay with the truth of original sources. It's obviously a labor of love. Thank you! It's time to level up your two apps, time to make them world-class.

Internet Archive Blogs A blog from the team at archive.org Blog Announcements archive.org About Events Developers Donate New Digital Collection Preserves Key Books on Drug Use and Policy Posted on April 22, 2025 by Caralee Adams For many years, the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) maintained a large library of books on drug use and policy at its New York City headquarters. As researchers shifted to working online, DPAâs Jules Netherland said she noticed fewer people coming into the office to use the collection. âIt became clear if we really wanted people to benefit from our resources that digitization was the way to go,â said Netherland, managing director of the Allianceâs Department of Research and Academic Engagement. It was also an opportunity to add to the growing collection of the Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists (SALIS). DPA donated its book collection to the Internet Archive to be digitized and made available for lending and for the print disabled. A team was sent to New York to pick up the books, which were packaged onto three pallets and shipped to a facility for scanning and storage. Now, the digital version of the DPA library, with 2,260 items, is available to the public at https://archive.org/details/dpa . It is part of the larger SALIS collection of 8,647 items on alcohol and substance abuse digitized by SALIS. Browse the new Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) collection: https://archive.org/details/dpa The new donation covers books on a range of subjects going back to the 1900s, said Liz Rosenberg, donations manager for the Internet Archive. There are volumes on historical and cultural analysis of drug use, policy and politics around drugs, pharmacological studies, and books specific to a particular drug. Titles now digitized include: Deadly medicine: Indians and alcohol in early America ; Between prohibition and legalization : the Dutch experiment in drug policy ; Pain, analgesia, and addiction: the pharmacologic treatment of pain ; and Meth wars : police, media, power . The public has responded with curiosity. In January, 10,000 items were accessed in the digitized collection. Rosenberg speculates the audience is likely researchers, historians, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Resource guide developed for the collection. In the rapidly evolving field of drug policy, which spans many disciplines, Netherland said itâs important to provide evidence-based information to the public. The hope is to enhance advocacy efforts with easier access to the organizationâs collection. DPA developed a resource guide to encourage its use on the Internet Archive. In donating its collection, DPA helped build the Internet Archiveâs SALIS collection. Since 2008, SALIS has helped preserve thousands of items from physical libraries with research from drug and alcohol fields that have closed, said Andrea Mitchell, SALIS executive director. About 30 years ago, there were approximately 95 libraries, clearinghouses, and resource centers around the world devoted to collecting, cataloguing, and disseminating information concerning alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, Mitchell said. However, today the majority of thoseÂ  librariesÂ  or databases have closed. The U.S. government has also shut down collections, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse, whose library went back to 1935. âWeâre losing important resources and knowledge,â Mitchell said. This leaves a void in access that has been filled, in part, by digitized collections online. Mitchell said The SALIS Collection includes materials that go back to 1774 and books from medicine, sociology, psychology, economics, law and policy, criminal justice, and other fields. In addition to books, there are government documents, grey literature, and newsletters. The DPA collection was one of the larger libraries in the U.S., Mitchell said, and its donation to the Internet Archive is significant and welcome. The Internet Archive is interested in receiving more curated collections like DPAâs on specific subject matters, Rosenberg added. âThese really valuable books for research and resources are often not preserved when funding is lost at the library that houses them,â she saidTo find out more about the physical item donation process, go to the Help page for details.

Leave a reply Leave a reply Take Action: Defend the Internet Archive Posted on April 17, 2025 by Chris Freeland The Internet Archive needs your help. A coalition of major record labels has filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archiveâdemanding $700 million for our work preserving and providing access to historical 78rpm records. These fragile, obsolete discs hold some of the earliest recordings of a vanishing American culture. But this lawsuit goes far beyond old records. Itâs an attack on the Internet Archive itself. This lawsuit is an existential threat to the Internet Archive and everything we preserveâincluding the Wayback Machine , a cornerstone of memory and preservation on the internet. At a time when digital information is disappearing, being rewritten, or erased entirely, the tools to preserve history must be defendedânot dismantled. This isnât just about music. Itâs about whether future generations will have access to knowledge, history, and culture. Sign our open letter and tell the record labels to drop their lawsuit.

Community Webs advances the capacity of community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories. San Francisco History Center (SFHC) of the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) is the official archive for the City and County of San Francisco. SFHC serves all library users and levels of interest, from the merely curious to those engaging in scholarly research. Because of the Centerâs archival function, it also administers the archival collections of the James C. Hormel LGBTQIA Center . Internet Archive has supported our work to preserve and provide access to San Franciscoâs history in many ways. Since 2007, Internet Archive has hosted SFPL digitized content, including local documents and city directories . In 2017, SFPL became one of the first members of Internet Archiveâs Community Webs program. This program has provided us with the tools we need to preserve local web-based content that will be important for future researchers investigating San Franciscoâs history. In 2023, the Community Webs program was awarded a grant from the National Historical Publication and Records Commission for the âCollaborative Access to Diverse Public Library Local History Collectionsâ project . This grant supported the digitization of local history collections from libraries across the country, including SFPL. With this support, 23 bound volumes of a Chinese/English language newspaper East/West and 4 cartons of oral histories from the Paul Radin Papers were digitized by Internet Archive. Cover of East/West, 1968, Vol. 2, no. 23 East/West The East/West (Dong xi bao) newspaper was acquired the easy way â original subscription by the SFPLâs Periodical Department in the late 1960s. There are only a handful of institutions that have East/West in their holdings as microfilm only. SFHC has the complete run in paper format. In late 1966, Gordon Lew and two Chinese newspaper colleagues, Kenneth Joe and Ken Wong, began the idea of East/West , a bilingual weekly newspaper published out of San Franciscoâs Chinatown. The inaugural issue was in January 1967 and the newspaper ran for over twenty-two years with the last issue in September 1989. Lew became the publisher and editor, Joe worked in the Chinese section, and Wong was the principal writer in the English section. East/West was an important community newspaper, with extensive coverage of local Chinatown news, social activities, the work of Chinese American political figures, and international developments such as the normalization of China ties. East/West was published in English and Chinese, and for many years, the two sections had approximately the same number of pages. The editorial and perhaps the main news article in the English section would be translated into Chinese. The Chinese section tended to focus more on culture, arts, and history, and it often reprinted articles from other sources. Advertisements filled both sections from the very beginning for local businesses and services. Most were community ads as the newspaper served non-profit organizations that arose in the wake of the Chinese American and Asian American empowerment movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Miss Chinatown, East/West, 1977, Vol. 11, no. 9, p. 14 Researchers and scholars of 20 th -century Chinese American communities in the United States will appreciate the online availability of this unique resource. Many important issues cropped up in Chinese America and Asian America starting in the late 1960s and these can be found in East/West from the community perspective. By being a bilingual publication, the newspaper captured and shared the voice of the community. In addition, San Francisco Chinese Americans had limited political power in the 1960s. East/West focused on emerging Chinese American political figures and urged the community to increase its voting and general political participation. Browse East/West on archive.org Paul Radin Papers In 2003, the Paul Radin Papers were donated to the SFHC by Professor Luis S. Kemnitzer of San Francisco State University on behalf of Calvin Fast Wolf and Mary Sacharoff-Fast Wolf. Mary Wolf was a would-be biographer of Radin who had acquired original papers from her friend and Radinâs widow, Doris Woodward Radin, as well as colleagues. Dr. Paul Radin (1883-1959) is considered to be one of the formative influences in contemporary anthropology and ethnography in the United States and Europe. The bulk of the Paul Radin Papers consists of surveys from Radinâs supervision of over 200 workers who interviewed ethnic groups in the San Francisco Bay Area for the State Emergency Relief Administration of California (SERA) over a period of nine months in 1934-1935. Known as SERA project 2-F2-98 (3-F2-145), its abstract was published in 1935 as The Survey of San Franciscoâs Minorities: Its Purpose and Results . The stated purpose was a cultural survey to find employment for âwhite collarâ unemployed workers on temporary relief. Radinâs focus was âto study the steps in the adjustment and assimilation of minority groups in San Francisco and Alameda counties.â Bypassing a typical questionnaire method, Radin instead had the amateur interviewers record anything and everything which the interviewees wished to say. The results appear in a narrative formatâsometimes in the form of poetry and short storiesâand encompass all manner of immigrant experiences. Survey materials include typed and handwritten interviews and research on ethnic groups. Some interviewers identify themselves, and their report appears in their own hand. Jon Y. Leeâs notes, Paul Radin Papers A portion of the Paul Radin Papers includes SERA worker Jon Y. Leeâs papers including material for The Golden Mountain . Lee was the son of Chinese immigrants who settled in Oakland, California. Radin hired Lee as a fieldworker to collect Chinatown traditions in Oakland, California. Today, Lee is recognized as the first Asian American to work professionally as a folklorist. With this collection online, international scholars can now easily access narratives about the immigrant experience from their country/region to assist with their diaspora studies. The typed descriptions allow for OCR discovery and for one to gather more information on the San Francisco immigrant experience in the 1910s and 1920s.

The digitized documents have been preserved and are accessible online through the Coleccion Aruba and the Internet Archive . The registration formally incorporates Arubaâs contributions into the existing entry titled â Documentary heritage of the enslaved people of the Dutch Caribbean and their descendants (1816â1969) ,â which already included documents from CuraÃ§ao, Sint Maarten, Suriname, and the Netherlands. These newly recognized documents are held by the National Archives of Aruba (ANA) and the National Library of Aruba (BNA) . They offer crucial insight into the lives of enslaved people and their descendants in Aruba, helping to illuminate a shared painful past and its continuing impact on the present. The nomination was prepared collaboratively by the Aruba National Committee for UNESCOâs Memory of the World Program (MoW-AW) , UNESCO Aruba , ANA, and BNA. With the registration now official, these documents are not only globally recognized as having international significanceâthey are also more accessible than ever before. The historical materials are available online through the Coleccion Aruba digital heritage site, as well as on the Internet Archive , supporting the goals of open access for schools, researchers, and the general public. This achievement underscores the importance of digitization and long-term preservation to ensure that future generations can continue to learn from these vital records. The Internet Archive congratulates MoW-AW, UNESCO Aruba, the National Archives and National Library of Aruba, and their partners in CuraÃ§ao, Sint Maarten, Suriname, and the Netherlands on this historic achievement.

Telderszaal, Academiegebouw (Leiden). Wiki info. The Internet Archive was recently honored for its valuable contribution to the Dutch-language Wikipedia community at an event at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle accepted the 2024 Project Uil award at a March 18 gathering of prominent figures in the Dutch open knowledge movement including librarians, archivists, scholars, and representatives from national cultural institutions. The WikiUilen awards have been given out since 2015 on behalf of the Dutch Wikipedia community in recognition of hardworking Wikipedia volunteers and organizations. Candidates in eight categories (project, writer, editor, newcomer, etc.) are nominated and voted on by fellow Wikipedians. The Internet Archive received the project award and a small replica of an ancient Greek owl sculpture. (âUilenâ in Dutch translates to âowlsâ in English.) WikiUilen âowlsâ âThe owl is a symbol of wisdom,â said Ronald Velgersdijk, organizer of the Dutch awards, in presenting the statue to Kahle. âWe give this project award because the Internet Archive is very important for sharing knowledge and it is very important for Wikimedia. We use it a lot to cite our sources and find information.â In a concerted effort to ground the information ecosystem in facts, Kahle explained how the Internet Archive has prioritized obtaining and digitizing books referenced in Wikipedia. Since 2016, the Internet Archive has identified and fixed more than 22 million broken links in over 200 language editions of Wikipedia. By pointing readers back to archived web pages in the Wayback Machine and digital books available online, the aim is to increase the credibility of Wikipedia with reliable links and sources, he said. âThe partnership between Wikipedia and the Internet Archive is very strong and growing,â Kahle said. Watch the Wiki Owl presentation to Internet Archive Jos Damen, a librarian at Leiden University, helped host the event, which drew nearly 100 attendees. An advocate of open access publishing and a Dutch Wikipedian with over 1 million edits, Damen said he admires the work of the Internet Archive and leans on its resources. âFirst and foremost of value is the presence of websites in the Wayback Machine,â Damen said. âAs librarians, we all know that links that you access now will be gone in two to five years. Itâs important to see these links frozen in time in the Wayback Machine, and then being able to have that reference in Wikipedia.â Damen said itâs critical to not only fix links to books, but also to add images and attribution for photos on Wikipedia. For instance, a photograph of small copper stones in the pavement in several European countries, signifying the last place where Jewish people lived before they were taken to concentration camps, is a powerful image that can make a page more engaging, he said. (See Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein ) Kahleâs remarks covered the history, evolving support, and challenges facing libraries. He spoke about the mission of the Internet Archive to provide universal access to all knowledge, and gave an overview of Internet Archive Europe â which has a somewhat different focus. âThe idea [of Internet Archive Europe] is to try to build our collective intelligence using all sorts of interesting tools so we can have better decision making,â Kahle said. Last November, Beatrice Murch was named Program Manager of Internet Archive Europe. She is working to find open knowledge champions in Europe interested in making information in a variety of languages translated and available in new ways. âThe hope is that Internet Archive Europe can use AI tools to bring collections to life and make them more interesting to the public,â Murch said. âWe are trying hard to find the right message to engage partners and make data on the Internet Archive accessible to more people, including those with disabilities. âThe Wiki-Uil in the Netherlands is modeled after the German example, started in 2014.

Libraries, now more than ever, need innovative, dedicated champions to help them meet the needs of the public in the digital age. Internet Archiveâs Lila Bailey said she sees hope in the talents of Georgetown University law students working at the schoolâs Intellectual Property and Information Policy Clinic (iPIP). Bailey, Internet Archiveâs senior policy counsel, was the keynote speaker at iPIPâs fifth anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C., on March 27. She praised the clinic for providing quality research and creative work products on projects that have helped the Internet Archive promote awareness of the public domain, controlled digital lending, and other issues related to the public interest mission of libraries at a challenging time. âLibraries are at the forefront of using technologies of the day to serve the informational needs of their communities. And they do it without trying to sell you anything, and without selling any data about you either,â Bailey said. âRight now, librariesâwhether they are digital, or brick and mortarâare under threat.â Between moves to ban books, defund institutions, and dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services, libraries are facing perilous times. Publishers have simply stopped selling digital books to libraries, forcing them to use commercial platforms that come with terms and conditions that restrict how those materials may be used, Bailey explained. The iPIP clinic had a hand in drafting a paper on the topic, she noted, called, âThe Publisher Playbook.â Today, libraries need lawyers, yet most donât have in-house counsel, Bailey said. That makes the contributions of student law clinics so vital at this juncture. âClinics play an important role in the library and public interest tech community by expanding our capacity to tackle these existential threats and to pursue opportunities for positive changes,â Bailey said. â[iPIPâs Founder] Amanda Levendowski has built a truly outstanding clinical program in these five short years.â Bailey explained under copyright law, a library can lend out a book it owns to as many people as it wants to, for as long as it wants to. It can also preserve a book for the long term, and make it available long past when a publisher may sell it. The law also allows libraries to make copies of a book in an accessible format for patrons who are blind or have other print-disabilities, and participate in interlibrary loan arrangements, so that patrons of other libraries can access books they donât have in their own collections. Yet, Bailey said, under these licensing models with publishers, none of those practices is allowed. âThese market-based threats are a completely new kind of challenge that require creative legal and policy interventions,â Bailey said. In her remarks, Bailey described how her interest in the field began nearly twenty years ago when she chose to go to law school at University of California Berkeley, in part because of its Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic. â[The internet] was new. I was optimistic to democratize access to information and saw it as a revolutionary force,â she said. Baileyâs first client at the clinic was the Internet Archive, working on a project that would eventually become the TV News Archive. She later became a teaching fellow at the clinic, and joined the Internet Archive staff in 2017. Since iPIPâs first semester in 2020, Bailey said she has worked closely with student teams that exceeded her expectations, delivering materials to advance the needs of the Internet Archive, and the wider library community. âThe iPIP Clinic has become an indispensable partner to me as I do my work as an advocate for libraries working to build a healthier digital information ecosystem,â Bailey said. Amanda Levendowski, associate professor of law and the founding director of the iPIP Clinic, credited Bailey and her willingness to work with students as a reason the clinic has been successful in tackling cutting-edge issues at the intersection of technological advancements and social justice. âLibrary lawyering work is an exercise in imagination,â Levendowski said. âA sense of play and creativity around the law has never been more important, because thatâs going to be how we get out of the moment weâre in.â Posted in News | Defending Libraries in the Digital Age: Lila Bailey Calls for Library Legal Champions at Georgetown Lawâs iPIP Clinic Celebration by Caralee Adams Caralee Adams Libraries, now more than ever, need innovative, dedicated champions to help them meet the needs of the public in the digital age.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. I would never have thought I would see the day when the library system itself is under attack. At home I had a couple of shelves of treasured kidsâ books while my parents had walls coated with books. The books and periodicals of my writer and publisher grandfather were on a special bookshelf in the room next to the kitchenâmaybe not consulted often, but proudly protected and displayed. But the delight of first going to the White Plains Public Library is indelibly imprinted in my mindâthe bookshelves seemed to go on forever. There was book after book after Alice in Wonderland in the card catalog, books about mathematical recreations I could not imagine finding anywhere else, and record albums I could borrow. And I still remember the librarian saying, âYou can read any of these books you want, and if we donât have the one you want, we can get it for you [through the magic of interlibrary loan].â And this was all for free, which was the only thing that worked for a child. And available to everyone who could get their bones through that door of that magic place. As a child, I did not know how special libraries wereâI thought it was just how society workedâI thought there always were and always would be public libraries. I did not realize how fragile this system was until I became a digital librarian in order to make this promise come true for the next generation, a generation of digital learners. I did not think that in my lifetime this offer, this seeming human right, would be threatened by the people that made the fantasy-land of the White Plains Public Library possible: the corporate publishers. Based on a simple but catastrophic business decision, the big publishers are making it impossible for libraries to do their core functions of preservation and enduring access in the digital era. Netflix, for instance, recently changed its terms of service to explicitly prohibit archiving, therefore allowing them to remove or change any movie for all subscribers at once. 1 The decision of the big publishers that is so threatening to the mission of libraries is to stop selling their products. Their books, music, and videosâas the world moves digitalâare only available for temporary access by library patrons from databases the publishers control. At the dawn of the Internet age, we dreamed of a different future, a future where authors got paid for their work, where writings would find their natural audience, where small publishers would flourish supporting a wider range of authors, where new publications and services would democratize production and access to information. The Internet could have been used to create this future, and many of us have worked hard to make it come true, but the lack of antitrust enforcement led to rapid consolidation of publishers, Internet technologies allowed successful online publishers to become dominant worldwide, and an advertising model that made for very few commercial winners. This toxic brew of the collapse of independent publishers and limited commercial platform controlling distribution has made the decentralized Internet seem like a lost opportunity. Libraries in the United States are under attack through book bannings, 2 defundings , 3 increasing criminalization of librarianship , 4 licensing restrictions , 5 governors vetoing protection for libraries , 6 and a judiciary that is steadily siding with publishers . 7 This is a long way from a century ago when the United States led in libraries with the Carnegie librariesâsupported by legislatures and judiciaryâhelping create an educated citizenry ready to enter the world stage. Download the complete Vanishing Culture report. But there is hope for libraries and a public seeking alternatives to the flood of disinformation and promoted materials coming from online and offline information producers. Libraries are still funded and staffed with smart, caring professionals. Readers are becoming more media-aware and discerning. Best of all, people are still free to create and publish quality works with the remaining distribution and compensation structures. It is still possible to have a game with many winners, but maybe this window is closing. To preserve the library systemâs ability to help create an informed citizenry, we need libraries to buy, preserve, and offer free public access to the broad public. Our libraries have traditionally supported local authors and local publishers, and preserved a broad range of text, audio, and moving image materials. Libraries, when not stopped, have moved with the times, through microfilm and CD-ROMs, and now to the Internet in order to provide preservation and access. Our collective budgets in the United States support over 5% of all trade publishing revenues 8 âenough to cause a leveraged buyout firm, KKR, to find buying major publisher Simon and Schuster a good investment. 9 Our libraries are a captive market for a shrinking number of academic and trade publishers. The best case is that large publishers see the value in selling their digital products through multiple marketplaces, including to libraries. The next best is that independent publishers sell to libraries, and libraries eagerly buy, preserve, and lend from their owned collections. Authors, musicians, filmmakers and creators of all kinds could choose publishers and websites that sell to libraries . 10 Our evolving digital age can be our next Carnegie moment or it can be a Library of Alexandria moment.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. I would never have thought I would see the day when the library system itself is under attack. At home I had a couple of shelves of treasured kidsâ books while my parents had walls coated with books. The books and periodicals of my writer and publisher grandfather were on a special bookshelf in the room next to the kitchenâmaybe not consulted often, but proudly protected and displayed. But the delight of first going to the White Plains Public Library is indelibly imprinted in my mindâthe bookshelves seemed to go on forever. There was book after book after Alice in Wonderland in the card catalog, books about mathematical recreations I could not imagine finding anywhere else, and record albums I could borrow. And I still remember the librarian saying, âYou can read any of these books you want, and if we donât have the one you want, we can get it for you [through the magic of interlibrary loan].â And this was all for free, which was the only thing that worked for a child. And available to everyone who could get their bones through that door of that magic place. As a child, I did not know how special libraries wereâI thought it was just how society workedâI thought there always were and always would be public libraries. I did not realize how fragile this system was until I became a digital librarian in order to make this promise come true for the next generation, a generation of digital learners. I did not think that in my lifetime this offer, this seeming human right, would be threatened by the people that made the fantasy-land of the White Plains Public Library possible: the corporate publishers. Based on a simple but catastrophic business decision, the big publishers are making it impossible for libraries to do their core functions of preservation and enduring access in the digital era. Netflix, for instance, recently changed its terms of service to explicitly prohibit archiving, therefore allowing them to remove or change any movie for all subscribers at once. 1 The decision of the big publishers that is so threatening to the mission of libraries is to stop selling their products. Their books, music, and videosâas the world moves digitalâare only available for temporary access by library patrons from databases the publishers control. At the dawn of the Internet age, we dreamed of a different future, a future where authors got paid for their work, where writings would find their natural audience, where small publishers would flourish supporting a wider range of authors, where new publications and services would democratize production and access to information. The Internet could have been used to create this future, and many of us have worked hard to make it come true, but the lack of antitrust enforcement led to rapid consolidation of publishers, Internet technologies allowed successful online publishers to become dominant worldwide, and an advertising model that made for very few commercial winners. This toxic brew of the collapse of independent publishers and limited commercial platform controlling distribution has made the decentralized Internet seem like a lost opportunity. Libraries in the United States are under attack through book bannings, 2 defundings , 3 increasing criminalization of librarianship , 4 licensing restrictions , 5 governors vetoing protection for libraries , 6 and a judiciary that is steadily siding with publishers . 7 This is a long way from a century ago when the United States led in libraries with the Carnegie librariesâsupported by legislatures and judiciaryâhelping create an educated citizenry ready to enter the world stage. But there is hope for libraries and a public seeking alternatives to the flood of disinformation and promoted materials coming from online and offline information producers. Libraries are still funded and staffed with smart, caring professionals. Readers are becoming more media-aware and discerning. Best of all, people are still free to create and publish quality works with the remaining distribution and compensation structures. It is still possible to have a game with many winners, but maybe this window is closing. To preserve the library systemâs ability to help create an informed citizenry, we need libraries to buy, preserve, and offer free public access to the broad public. Our libraries have traditionally supported local authors and local publishers, and preserved a broad range of text, audio, and moving image materials. Libraries, when not stopped, have moved with the times, through microfilm and CD-ROMs, and now to the Internet in order to provide preservation and access. Our collective budgets in the United States support over 5% of all trade publishing revenues 8 âenough to cause a leveraged buyout firm, KKR, to find buying major publisher Simon and Schuster a good investment. 9 Our libraries are a captive market for a shrinking number of academic and trade publishers. The best case is that large publishers see the value in selling their digital products through multiple marketplaces, including to libraries. The next best is that independent publishers sell to libraries, and libraries eagerly buy, preserve, and lend from their owned collections. Authors, musicians, filmmakers and creators of all kinds could choose publishers and websites that sell to libraries . 10 Our evolving digital age can be our next Carnegie moment or it can be a Library of Alexandria moment.

Read more essays online or download the full report now. As a writer and artist that draws on the long history of gender nonconformity in my work, a driving force behind my practice is the idea that a longing for history will always be a fundamental aspect of humanity, so long as memory itself serves as a foundation for human consciousness. Everyone has a history, but the majority of people are not taught how to look back in order to find it. One problem is the depth and breadth of our losses. People and their prized possessions are destroyed by accident and by design throughout history: armed conflict, invasion, willful destruction, natural disaster, decay. Then there is the fantasy of destruction, a destructive force in its own right, the perception that nothing survives. That fantasy begets a reality of its own: because I donât go looking for what survives, I donât find it, or I donât recognize it when I see it. This is true across subcultures and among historically marginalized or oppressed groups, and for the queer and trans subjects whose histories I am interested in recovering in particular. In the twenty-first century, access to queer and trans history is an accident of birth: knowing someone in your family or neighborhood, living in a place where it isnât legislated against, going to a school that dares teach it, affording admission into one of the universities that offers classes on it. My research process tends to triangulate between the archive of my own weird and imperfect human experiences and the debris I collect around them, small collections amassed by and for queer and trans people, and larger institutions that also contain relevant material that begs to be recontextualized. Or to make it personal: to write my upcoming book Bargain Witch: Essays in Self Initiation, I used my journals and the Wayback Machine to look at old websites Iâd made when I was 14, the archive of the William Way LGBT center in Philadelphia where I grew up, and special collections at major institutions like the Fales Library at NYU , the Digital Transgender Archive at Northwestern University, and the British Library in London. All my adult life Iâve made pilgrimage between the intimate domestic spaces where people preserve their own histories, to local collections set up on shoestring budgets as a labor of love, to the vast, climate-controlled repositories of state and higher education that have more recently begun to preserve our histories, each enhancing what it is possible for me to know, delight in, or mourn, about where I have come from, the forebears by blood and by choice that imbue my life with its many possibilities. Itâs a creative act to find and make sense of my own history, one that requires a leap of faith in order to fill in the silences, erasures, omissions, and genuine mysteries that old books and documents, records and artifacts, represent. A lot is left to the imagination. Much of what survives from the past asks more questions than we can answer. This is true for queer and trans archival traces, as it is for other aspects of humanity that are poorly accounted for in public records, or actively discriminated against through surveillance and omission in equal parts. Classically, archives are brutal, desolate places to find humanity; they were never meant to record the nuances of flesh and blood existence so much as they originate as a way governments keep track of their resources. It has taken millennia for us to conceive of records as places where humanity might be honored rather than betrayed. This is an epic change: I am in awe of the fact that I live in a time where the heft of documentary historyâclay, parchment, paper, and now pixelâis shifting paradigms from records kept by anonymous paid laborers to flatten life into statistics, to records kept by people who dare to name themselves and their subjectivity, who collect something of themselves and their obsessions, for other kindred spirits to find. From archives as places meant to consolidate power, to places containing mess and sprawl, places for heated encounters. In the past few decades of âliving with the internetâ these places and encounters have multiplied exponentially, as queer and trans subcultures have relied on message boards, blogs, and personal websites to share information. I personally relied (and still rely on) on reddit, and the classic, Hudsonâs FTM Resource Guide ( www.ftmguide.org ), and TopSurgery.Net to navigate the healthcare system in both the UK and USA in order to access hormones and surgeryâpart of a much longer tradition of âthe Transgender Internetâ that Avery Dame-Griff chronicles in his book The Two Revolutions (2023). To say nothing of AOL in the early 2000s, the culture on Tumblr in the early-to-mid 2010s and printed publications like Original Plumbing and archived copies of the FTM Newsletter. Digital environments informed me of physical places, and vice versa, and each expanded and embellished my appreciation of the other. From reading books and trawling the internet, I knew places like San Francisco, New York, London, and Berlin would be where I could find other trans people. When I moved to London, I knew to go to Gayâs the Word , a queer bookshop that first opened in 1979, to make friends, and eventually, to get a job. When I started my own queer book club, or wanted to find zine fairs or club nights, I often found information about them on tumblr or instagram. When traveling to new cities, a gay friend tipped me off that any place recommended by BUTT Magazine would show me a good time. But in my queer and trans context, both digital and paper-based archives and libraries are often labors of love, made from scratch, published with a âby us for usâ ethos that is under-resourced and so always in danger of disappearing. Most queer publishing from the 1960s onward was issued in small, independent presses that have disappeared. An interesting model for documenting this is the British Libraryâs Endangered Archives Programme , where resources and expertise is shared to catalog and digitize collections materials in a centrally kept database. This is mutually beneficial to the places where the materials are keptâaccurate cataloging is crucial to using and developing any archiveâas well as to interested audiences further afield. And this feels also like a pragmatic approach to the reality of loss: we might not be able to predict what will survive over time, but keeping abundant records in multiple locations of what has existed will at least allow us to mourn our losses. Download the complete Vanishing Culture report. A culmination of my interests in hunting and gathering queer history is my imprint and traveling installation: CAMP BOOKS. I started CAMP BOOKS in 2018 as a way to highlight the places Iâd most enjoyed meeting queer and trans peopleâindependent bookshops, which have a rich, radical history throughout subcultureâand as a way to keep the focus on making and distributing publications about the obscure histories I was unearthing in my research. Before libraries sought to cater to an LGBTQIA+ readership, specialist bookshops like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop , Giovanniâs Room , and Gayâs the Word were the only places you could find concentrations of queer, feminist books with positive portrayals of queer lives. These shops were hubs of culture: places where community events were held and publicized, activists groups were able to meet, and friendship and romance could blossom in broad daylight. CAMP BOOKS sets up pop-up bookshops, tables at art and zine fairs, and also builds installations in galleries and community spaces to continue this tradition. I also sell rare books and ephemera related to queer history through CAMP BOOKS in order to fund our efforts, including new publications, zines, and posters related to queer and trans history. The CAMP BOOKS motto is: âQueer Pasts Nourish Queer Futures,â and this extends to our model of generating funds from past efforts to fund new writing and work. I also believe this logic can extend to anyone: preserving what interests you about the past brings a particular pleasure of connection into the present. Most of the people I have loved in my life, I have met and known through shared obsessions with the past, and it has brought a lot of pleasure and adventure into my life. An abiding concern I have had about cultural preservationâin my case, subcultural preservation, because the people I love across time existed in a myriad of DIY subcultures that often cross-pollinated art, music, and literary influencesâand have heard from others, revolves around the question of inheritance and access. You can inherit books and papers, art and artifacts, but you canât inherit e-books, and born digital archives require specialist care and technology. My hope is that this divide is bridged by reconsidering the nature of inheritance itself: rather than an individualâs gain, queer and trans history is something that we are all heir to, and can all benefit from accessing. Large institutions, and large digital repositories in particular, play a crucial role in rewriting the meaning of inheritance by offering freely accessible, and accurately cataloged, information. But ultimately, archives that document human experience begin at home, and rely on people whose love for their lives, their friends, and their scenes inspire them to save posters, photographs, and other receiptsâonline and offlineâthat document their experiences. I hope after reading this, you start saving something of your life now.

Namely, we were there to connect with the digital rights community. We wanted to participate in an event where thousands of people travel from around the world to discuss the current and future state of the internet, and to meet others who were involved in building decentralized, distributed, and peer-to-peer network technologies. Thus we took the opportunity to organize activities before and during the conference: a local networking workshop co-organized with g0v, sessions on both DWeb organizing and how fiction can better depict surveillance technologies, a DWeb dinner, as well as a final day of tabling in the halls of the venue. DWeb x g0v Local Network Workshop Michael Suantak, Cheng of g0v, and mai standing in front of National Taipei University of Technology where the community network workshop took place We partnered with g0v, the leading decentralized civic technology community in Taiwan , to co-organize an event focused on local community networks at the National Taipei University of Technology. When we met with them several months ago, g0v leaders told us that they wanted to connect with those building and stewarding community networks. Such networks are controlled directly by communities, especially in places where internet access is non-existent or undermined, in order to maintain local network services and ensure internet connections are available or affordable. In Taiwan, these types of decentralized network infrastructures are a potential lifeline, as internet shutdowns in the country remain an ever-present threat . DWeb standing banner in front of the classroom where the workshop took place Our event, âBuilding Resilient Connections: A Hands-on Local Network Workshopâ dove into the core concepts of community networks, their technical setups, and the ways theyâre making a difference in under-served communities worldwide. We had a great turnout: attended by more than 35 people. Since we had a survey built into our registration form, we knew what topics the participants were interested in learning about and tailored the workshop to them. These included community networksâ key challenges and opportunities, technical overview and tools, and issues surrounding their ethics, privacy and security. Cheng introducing g0v at the community network workshop Notably, we had community network leaders from Myanmar, Taiwan, and Indonesia present case studies on their community networks, from the technologies they use to the ways they govern and manage the networks. We were lucky to be able to bring Michael Suantak to lead the presentations and the workshop on locally-hosted services. He was a 2024 DWeb Fellow, but for visa reasons he was not able to attend DWeb Camp in person, so we were happy to learn from him in person! Michael Suantak giving a presentation on local community networks Sean of Mesh TWC also gave a presentation and workshop, as well as Gustaff H. Iskandar of Common Room who joined us from Indonesia. The sessions were not recorded, but you can view their notes and slides below (note: these are Google docs and Google slides). Presentation by Michael Suantak Presentation by Gustaff H. Iskandar ( Common Room ) Presentation by Sean ( Mesh TWC ) Slide from a presentation by Gustaff of Common Room on community networks We ended with a few hands-on activities with Meshtastic LoRa devices and local-first services, as well as a discussion on the role of community networks in digital literacy and empowerment. Group photo of the community networks workshop who stayed until the end! Attending RightsCon 2025 RightsCon brings over 3,000 people from all corners of the globe to discuss the most pressing concerns facing peopleâs digital rights today. At a sprawling convention center in Taipei, hundreds of sessions took place across the last week of February, on issues related to free expression, privacy, and innovation and creativity online â specifically surrounding organizing tactics, policy advocacy, and sustaining movements in the face of rising authoritarianism worldwide. There was also notable interest in decentralized web solutions to these crises, with sessions led by DWeb Camp attendees, the Social Web Foundation , Equalitie , Project Liberty , Open Future , WITNESS , Open Archive , and Creative Commons . RightsCon25 Opening Ceremony Round Table DWeb Workshop We led a workshop discussion on strategies for decentralized, transnational organizing. Approximately 25 people attended and came to learn about the DWeb community. We shared our approach to building trust and solidarity between projects and individuals working to create a decentralized web that is usable, secure, and people-centric, all in spite of the exploitative and profit-driven status quo of the Internet. We spent the hour strategizing effective tactics for transnational organizing. Namely, how to use in-person and online gatherings to organize, share resources, and build enduring connections to strengthen our efforts. Stop Surveillance Copaganda Workshops Lia Holland of Fight for the Future and I co-facilitated three workshops on the Stop Surveillance Copaganda project, a partnership between Fight For the Future and COMPOST Magazine . The discussions centered around how we better support fiction that depicts futures and alternate realities where privacy is a universally respected human right. Attendees shared useful resources and analyses of surveillance techâs impacts, as well as real-world tactics to resist illegal surveillance. Everything we gleaned from that week will go into a toolkit for authors and artists to more justly depict surveillance technologies. Stop Surveillance Copaganda Session at RightsCon25 RightsCon Booth We signed up to table at RightsCon in order to introduce ourselves to the digital rights community and meet those working to build alternative, decentralized technologies. Dozens of new and familiar faces stopped by to grab our stickers and zines, and to learn about what the DWeb community has been doing to build our movement. Senior Organizer, mai, tabling at RightsCon25 DWebbers Dinner Mid-conference, we organized a DWeb hot pot dinner for those of us in town for the event! Group photo of DWebbers having hot pot! Attending RightsCon this year felt incredibly productive and worthwhile. Weâll likely be there at the next one â in order to build better webs and learn from the past, itâs crucial that we connect with those directly confronting the pervasive challenges of the mainstream internet. That has always been our north star: to build decentralized technologies that help solve real world problems, not just in the future, but now. DWebbers & friends at a Buddhist temple in Taipei Posted in Past Event | Tagged DWeb , DWeb Meetup | DWeb and Digital Rights: A Report Back from RightsCon in Taipei by mai ishikawa sutton mai ishikawa sutton In late February, members of the DWeb Core Team and the DWeb community were in Taipei to attend the 13th edition of RightsCon , the largest global summit on human rights in the digital age. Namely, we were there to connect with the digital rights community. We wanted to participate in an event where thousands of people travel from around the world to discuss the current and future state of the internet, and to meet others who were involved in building decentralized, distributed, and peer-to-peer network technologies. Thus we took the opportunity to organize activities before and during the conference: a local networking workshop co-organized with g0v, sessions on both DWeb organizing and how fiction can better depict surveillance technologies, a DWeb dinner, as well as a final day of tabling in the halls of the venue. DWeb x g0v Local Network Workshop We partnered with g0v, the leading decentralized civic technology community in Taiwan , to co-organize an event focused on local community networks at the National Taipei University of Technology. When we met with them several months ago, g0v leaders told us that they wanted to connect with those building and stewarding community networks. Such networks are controlled directly by communities, especially in places where internet access is non-existent or undermined, in order to maintain local network services and ensure internet connections are available or affordable. In Taiwan, these types of decentralized network infrastructures are a potential lifeline, as internet shutdowns in the country remain an ever-present threat . Our event, âBuilding Resilient Connections: A Hands-on Local Network Workshopâ dove into the core concepts of community networks, their technical setups, and the ways theyâre making a difference in under-served communities worldwide. We had a great turnout: attended by more than 35 people. Since we had a survey built into our registration form, we knew what topics the participants were interested in learning about and tailored the workshop to them. These included community networksâ key challenges and opportunities, technical overview and tools, and issues surrounding their ethics, privacy and security. Notably, we had community network leaders from Myanmar, Taiwan, and Indonesia present case studies on their community networks, from the technologies they use to the ways they govern and manage the networks. We were lucky to be able to bring Michael Suantak to lead the presentations and the workshop on locally-hosted services. He was a 2024 DWeb Fellow, but for visa reasons he was not able to attend DWeb Camp in person, so we were happy to learn from him in person! Sean of Mesh TWC also gave a presentation and workshop, as well as Gustaff H. Iskandar of Common Room who joined us from Indonesia. The sessions were not recorded, but you can view their notes and slides below (note: these are Google docs and Google slides). Presentation by Michael Suantak Presentation by Gustaff H. Iskandar ( Common Room ) Presentation by Sean ( Mesh TWC ) We ended with a few hands-on activities with Meshtastic LoRa devices and local-first services, as well as a discussion on the role of community networks in digital literacy and empowerment.

And if compressed with x265, it maybe could even be 5 GB with no noticeable loss of quality? I see the bitrate is about 6 Mbps. This seems much more than strictly necessary, and I think 1 Mbps would be plenty with respect to x265, especially seeing that these are cartoons and not live video. The amount of information in them is proportionally small. Using ffmpeg, a setting of -crf 23 with the codec libx265 should be more than enough for a very faithful reproduction.

We are avid readers, educators, researchers, librarians, authors, publishers and lifelong learners whose lives and communities have been transformed by public access to knowledge. In light of the ongoing legal battle in Hachette v. Internet Archive , we are writing to urge you to reconsider your stance and restore our access to the books that you have caused to be removed from the Internet Archiveâs lending collection. For more than twenty years, the Internet Archive has empowered students, teachers, and readers around the world, providing access to a vital library of books, many of which are otherwise inaccessible to readers due to geographical, financial, or physical constraints. Your decision to remove books from the Internet Archive is having a devastating impact on readers in the US and around the world, with far-reaching implications: 1. Educational Impact: Students, scholars, and educators rely on the Internet Archive for access to research materials and literature that support their learning and academic growth, particularly in underserved communities where access is limited. Your removal of these books impedes academic progress and innovation, as well as imperiling the preservation of our cultural and historical knowledge. 2. Equity and Accessibility: The Internet Archive democratizes access to knowledge. By restricting access to these books, you have made it harder for the most vulnerable people in our society to read and learn. Not everyone has a local library, can afford to travel to one, feels safe accessing the information they need in public, or can ignore the potentially life-altering repercussions when tech platforms collect data on their reading habits. Your removal of more than 500,000 books from public access is a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others. 3. Cultural Preservation: Librariesâ digital preservation of books ensures that our cultural heritage is maintained for future generations. In order to preserve digital books, libraries must be allowed to own them, not just license them short-term. Your attack on the rights of libraries is an attack on cultural preservation. We understand the importance of protecting authors' rights and ensuring fair compensation for their work. There is a way to achieve these goals while still allowing libraries to do what they have always doneâhelp readers read. We urge you to explore solutions with the Internet Archive that support both authors and the public good, such as selling eBooks to libraries to own, lend, and preserve. In the spirit of fostering a more equitable, informed, and connected world, we respectfully ask you to restore access to the books youâve taken down , and work with the Internet Archive to find a sustainable solution that empowers everyone in our society to read and learn.

2009. 155 30-minute episodes were produced over 21 seasons. Before its 
official premiere, the show aired for test audiences in the Nebraska and Buffalo, New York markets (their PBS member stations, the Nebraska ETV [now Nebraska Public Media] and WNED-TV , respectively, were co-producers of the show). The purpose of the show was to encourage a love of books and 
reading among children. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational 
interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched 
bearing the name of the program. The public television series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards , 10 of which were in the "Outstanding Children's Series" category. [5] The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila 
Liggett, PhD who in partnership with Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry 
Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York created the television 
series. The original team also included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen 
Schecter, and host LeVar Burton . The show's title was conceived by an unknown intern at WNED. [6] Each episode centered on a topic from a featured children's book 
that was explored through a number of on-location segments or stories. 
The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went 
to the library. After the show's cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was removed from the schedule. [3] At the time, it was the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . [note 1] It was one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo. On June 
20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 
36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes 
App Store. [7] Developed by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows 
children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring 
Burton, and earn rewards for reading. On the week of July 11, 2013, Reading Rainbow celebrated its 30th anniversary. [8] In May 2014, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds to make the app available online and for Android ,
 game consoles, smartphones, and other streaming devices along with 
creating a classroom version with the subscription fee waived for up to 
13,000 disadvantaged classrooms. The effort met its initial fundraising 
goal of $1,000,000 in 11 hours, [9] and ended a few days later at $5,408,916 from 105,857 backers. [10] This campaign led to the launch of Skybrary by Reading Rainbow , a web-based expansion of the Reading Rainbow app experience. [11] Due to a legal dispute, licensing of the Reading Rainbow brand was revoked from RRKidz in October 2017, and all its platforms (including Skybrary) [ citation needed ] were rebranded to LeVar Burton Kids . [12] citation needed An interactive revival titled Reading Rainbow Live debuted on Looped in March 2022. 2023-11-01 22:32:14 ReadingRainbowTVSeries plus-circle Add Review comment Reviews

I know when it concerns the Rock The Dragon collection, those episodes were heavily edited, so im not surprised if those are missing, but if you can, if you could clarify for me why those are missing, or they never were there to begin with, I'd greatly appreciate it. ...Less 617,451 Views 617,451 1,184 Favorites 1,184 Favorites 52 Reviews 52 DOWNLOAD OPTIONS download 412 files  download  Uplevel

golden age of film noir  Early
examples of the noir style include dark, stylized detective films such as John Huston âs The
Maltese Falcon (1941), Frank Tuttleâs This Gun for Hire (1942), Otto Preminger âs Laura (1944),
and Edward
Dmytryk âs Murder,
My Sweet (1944). Banned in occupied countries during the war,
these films became available throughout Europe beginning in 1946. French
cineastes admired them for their cold, cynical characters and dark, brooding
style, and they afforded the films effusive praise in French journals such
as Cahiers
du cinÃ©ma . French critics coined the term film noir in
reference to the low-keyed lighting used to enhance these
dramas stylisticallyâalthough the term would not become commonplace in
international critical circles until the publication of the book Panorama
du film noir americain (1955) by Raymond Borde and Ãtienne Chaumeton. Early

Ladd and Veronica Lake in The Blue Dahlia (1946), directed by

films reflected the disenchantment of the times. Pessimism and disillusionment
became increasingly present in the American psyche during the Great Depression of
the 1930s and the world war that followed. After the war, factors such as an
unstable peacetime economy, McCarthyism , and the
looming threat of atomic warfare manifested themselves
in a collective sense
of uncertainty. The corrupt and claustrophobic world of film noir embodied
these fears. Several examples of film noir, such as Dmytrykâs Cornered (1945), George Marshall âs The Blue Dahlia (1946), Robert
Montgomery âs Ride the Pink Horse (1947), and John Cromwell âs Dead
Reckoning (1947), share the common story line of a war veteran who
returns home to find that the way of life for which he has been fighting no
longer exists. In its place is the America of film noir: modernized, heartless,
coldly efficient, and blasÃ© about matters such as political corruption
and organized
crime . The darkness of these

of the major directors of film noirâsuch as Huston, Dmytryk, Cromwell, Orson Welles , and
othersâwere American. However, other Hollywood directors
renowned for a film noir style hailed from Europe , including Billy Wilder , Alfred Hitchcock , Jacques Tourneur ,
and Fritz Lang .
It is said that the themes of noir attracted European directors, who often felt
like outsiders within the Hollywood studio system. Such directors had been
trained to emphasize cinematic style as much as acting and narrative in order
to convey thought and emotion. Many

the genre Defining
the genre  Controversy
exists as to whether film noir can be classified as a genre or
subgenre, or if the term merely refers to stylistic elements common to various genres . Film noir
does not have a thematic coherence: the term is most often applied to crime
dramas, but certain westerns and comedies have been cited as examples of film
noir by some critics. Even such sentimental comedy-dramas as Frank Capra âs Itâs a Wonderful
Life (1946) have been cited as ânoir-ishâ by critics who find in
its suicidal hero and
bleak depiction of small-town life a tone suitably dismal for film noir. Such
films are also sometimes designated as âsemi-noir,â or film gris (âgray
filmâ), to indicate their hybrid status. Controversy

critics argue that film noir is but an arbitrary designation for
a multitude of dissimilar black-and-white dramas of the late 1940s and early

âdidnât think of them as âfilms noirâ; they thought they were making crime
films, thrillers, mysteries, and romantic melodramas.
The nonexistence of ânoirâ as a production category during the supposed heyday
of noir obviously problematizes the history of the genre.â Yet it cannot be
questioned that film noir connotes specific visual images and an aura of
postwar cynicism in
the minds of most film buffs. Indeed, several common characteristics connect
most films defined as ânoir.â Other
critics argue that film noir is but an arbitrary designation for
a multitude of dissimilar black-and-white dramas of the late 1940s and early
â50s. Film scholarÂ Chris Fujiwara contends that the makers of such films

underscored by the use of stark high-contrast lightingâthe most notable visual
feature of film noir. The shadowy noir style can be traced to the German Expressionist cinema
of the silent era. Robert Wiene âs Das
Kabinett des Doktor Caligari (1920; The Cabinet
of Dr. Caligari ) contains one of the best early examples of the
lighting techniques used to inspire the genre. Wiene used visual elements to
help define the title characterâs madness, including tilted cameras to
present skewed images
and a dark atmosphere in which only the faces of the actors were visible. This
Expressionistic style was later used by German directors such as Fritz Lang ( Metropolis ,
1927; M , 1931) and F.W. Murnau ( Nosferatu ,
1922; Sunrise ,
1927). The isolation from society of the typical noir hero was

Indemnity , 1944), Karl Freund ( Key Largo ,
1948), and Sid Hickox ( The Big Sleep ,
1948) to heighten the sombre tone of films in the genre. Classic images of noir
included rain-soaked streets in the early morning hours; street lamps with
shimmering halos; flashing neon signs on seedy taverns, diners, and apartment
buildings; and endless streams of cigarette smoke wafting in and out of
shadows. Such images would lose their indelibility with realistic lighting or
colour cinematography . These lighting effects were used in Hollywood by

Indemnity Key Largo The Big Sleep The inherent subjectivity
of Expressionism is also evident in film noirâs use of narration and flashback.
An omniscient, metaphor-spouting narrator (often the
central character, a world-weary private eye) frequently clarifies a
characteristically labyrinthine noir plot or offers a subjective, jaded point of
view. In other filmsâsuch as Welles âs Citizen Kane and Wilder âs Double Indemnity and Sunset
Boulevard (1950)âthe denouement (often
the death or downfall of the central character) is revealed in the opening
scenes; flashbacks then tell of the circumstances that led to the tragic
conclusion. Tension and suspense are increased by the use of all-knowing
narrators and flashbacks, in that the audience is always cognizant of
impending doom. The inherent subjectivity

Boulevard The noir hero The noir hero The heroes of noir generally share certain qualities,
such as moral ambiguity , a
fatalistic outlook, and alienation from society. They also exhibit an existential acceptance
of random, arbitrary occurrences as being the determining factors in life.
Although the âhard-boiled detectiveâ is the stereotypical noir hero ,
the central male characters in film noir range
from drifters ( John
Garfield in Tay Garnett âs The
Postman Always Rings Twice , 1946) to college professors ( Edward G.
Robinson in Langâs The Woman in
the Window , 1944). The ethics that
these characters espouse are often borne more of personal code than true concern
for their fellow man. For example, Humphrey Bogart (the
actor perhaps most associated with the genre) as private eye Sam Spade in The
Maltese Falcon is emotionally indifferent to the murder of his
partner and avenges his death primarily because âwhen one of your organization
gets killed, itâs bad business to let the killer get away with it.â Such
compassionless pragmatism is
found in the most noble, as well as the most tarnished, of noir heroes. The
weakest of such characters exhibit an abundance of tragic flaws, often
including an uncontrollable lust for duplicitous women. The heroes of noir generally share certain qualities,

Maltese Falcon    Noir women Noir women Noir women are often characterized as femme fatales
or âspider womenâ; in the words of one critic, they are âcomfortable in the
world of cheap dives, shadowy doorways, and mysterious settings.â Well aware of
their sexual attractiveness, they cunningly and ruthlessly manipulate their
male counterparts to gain power or wealth; for example, by conspiring to murder
an aged, wheelchair-bound (i.e., impotent) spouse. A quintessential example of
the noir temptress is Kathie Moffat, as portrayed byÂ Jane Greer in
Tourneurâs Out of the Past (1947).
While flirting with Robert Mitchum âs
character in a Mexican cafÃ©, she describes a local night spot that she thinks
would be to his liking. As she leaves the cafÃ©, she turns to Mitchum and coyly
says âI sometimes go thereââat which point, the viewer familiar with the
noir genre knows
that Mitchum is on a one-way path to destruction. Nevertheless, the women of
film noir often evoke sympathy, as they are frequently victims of emotional or
physical abuse, with such victimization providing impetus for
their vengeance .
They are trapped in passionless or violent marriages and resort to murder as a
means of escape, usually destroying their conspiring paramours in
the process. Noir women are often characterized as femme fatales

We partnered with the Sunlight Foundation , Philadelphiaâs Committee of Seventy (a non-partisan government watchdog) and University of Delawareâs Center for Community Research & Service for a pilot project to assist those studying how local media in the region are meeting the information needs of their communities and assessing the influence of political spending on the region's media ecosystem. Trained volunteers and others searched through archived television news content to initially identify more than 8,000 campaign commercials and tagged them with information on who paid for them.  Each identified political ad in the online library, that occurred within news programming, includes sponsorship identification that links through to the Sunlight Foundation's "Political Ad Sleuth" crowd-sourced presentations of who paid how much to the TV stations for airing the ads. Post-hoc analysis, using digital content âfingerprintingâ algorithms identified hundreds of political ads our human evaluators missed, raising the total to 8,594 within news programs.  Plus, the algorithms were able to analyze all the entertainment programs during the 65-day monitoring period, finding 5,081 political ads in them.  Metadata regarding the newly found ads, and an exploratory visualization tool, will be available soon. University of Delaware researchers analyzed the content of TV news broadcasts to assess their topics and relationships with issues raised in accompanying political ads.  They studied a representative sampling of newscasts on the major Philadelphia commercial television stations and found the time devoted to political ads outnumbered the time devoted to substantive political stories 45 to 1.

These unique collections offer unprecedented opportunities to explore the influence of powerful actors in the political process, investigate representation of important community issues within a media ecosystem and learn more about financial sources of political influence during the run-up to 2014âs November 4 elections. Although ambitious in its scope this year, the Project is also a pilot experiment to inform how its technologies and organizational collaborations can be improved and cost-effectively scaled across the U.S. in coming years.

The 9/11 Television News Archive is a library of news coverage of the events of 9/11/2001 and their aftermath as presented by U.S. and international broadcasters. A resource for scholars, journalists,  and the public, it presents one week of news broadcasts for study, research and analysis. Television is our pre-eminent medium of information, entertainment and persuasion, but until now it has not been a medium of record. This Archive attempts to address this gap by making TV news coverage of this critical week in September 2001 available to those studying these events and their treatment in the media. Explore 3,000 hours of international TV News from 20 channels over 7 days, and select analysis by scholars. REFLECTING ON 9/11: Twenty Years of Archived TV News Webinar On Sep 9, 2021 the Internet Archive will host an online webinar,
              " Reflecting on 9/11: Twenty Years of Archived TV News. "
              Scholars, journalists, archivists, and data scientists will discuss the importance
              of archived television to understand unfolding history.
              Participants include the Internet Archive,
              the American Archive of Public Broadcasting,
              the Vanderbilt Television News Archive.
              Speakers will include: Roger Macdonald (Founder Internet Archiveâs TV News Archive) Jim Duran (Director, Vanderbilt Television News Archives) Karen Cariani (David O Ives Executive Director/GBH Archives and GBH Project Director/American Archive of Public Broadcasting) Kalev Leetaru (Founder, Global Database of Events, Language and Tone Project) Phillip Bump (Washington Post national correspondent focused largely on the numbers behind politics) Roger Macdonald (Founder Internet Archiveâs TV News Archive) Jim Duran (Director, Vanderbilt Television News Archives) Karen Cariani (David O Ives Executive Director/GBH Archives and GBH Project Director/American Archive of Public Broadcasting) Kalev Leetaru (Founder, Global Database of Events, Language and Tone Project) Phillip Bump (Washington Post national correspondent focused largely on the numbers behind politics) 10-years ago: LEARNING FROM RECORDED MEMORY: 9/11 TV News Archive Conference Held on August 24, 2011 at New York University's Department of Cinema Studies, this conference highlighted work by scholars using television news materials to help us understand how TV news presented the events of 9/11/2001 and the international response. After brief welcoming remarks by Howard Besser , Director of New York University's Moving Image Archiving & Preservation Program and Richard Allen, Department of Cinema Studies, Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, 10 speakers presented the following short talks and ensuing discussion , which you can watch on the Internet Archive . Introducing the 9/11 TV News Archive Brewster Kahle, Internet Archive Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian at Internet Archive, introduces the 9/11 TV News Archive and reviews the case for online scholarly and research access to television news. Brewster Kahle, Internet Archive Mediated Meanings and Symbolic Politics: Exploring the Continued Significance of 9/11 News Coverage Brian A. Monahan, Iowa State University In-depth analysis of television news coverage of the September 11 attacks and their aftermath reveals how these events were fashionedinto 9/11, the politically and morally charged signifier that has profoundly shaped public perception, policy and practice in the last decade. Understanding how and why the coverage took shape as it did yields new insights into the social, cultural and political consequences of the attacks, while also highlighting the role of news media in the creation, affirmation and dissemination of meanings in modern life. Brian A. Monahan, Iowa State University Fighting Ephemerality: Seeing TV News through the Lens of the Archive Deborah Jaramillo, Boston University The experience of watching the news on TV as events unfold is often complicated by the space of exhibition -- typically, the domestic space. When hour upon hour of news is catalogued and archived -- placed in a space of focused study -- the news and the experience become altogether different. What was meant to be ephemeral acquires permanence, and what is usually a short-term viewing experience becomes a rigorous, frame-by-frame examination. In this presentation I will discuss how the archive challenges researchers to adopt new ways of seeing and explaining TV news. Deborah Jaramillo, Boston University An Overview of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive Marshall Breeding, Vanderbilt Television News Archive The Vanderbilt Television Archive was started in 1968. Marshall Breeding gives a brief overview of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive and how it carries out its mission to preserve and provide access to US national television news. Marshall Breeding, Vanderbilt Television News Archive Media Ecology and Online News Archives Mark J. Williams, Department of Film and Media Studies, Dartmouth College Online TV news archives are a crucial digital resource to facilitate the awareness of and critical study of Media Ecology. Two significant research and teaching outcomes for this area of study are A) to better understand the role of television news regarding the mediation of society and its popular memory, and B) to underscore the significance of television news to the goal of an informed citizenry. The 9/11 TV News Archive will enhance and ensure the continued study of the indelible tragic events and aftermath of 9/11, and make possible new interventions within journalism history and media history, via  online capacities for access and collaboration. Mark J. Williams, Department of Film and Media Studies, Dartmouth College Documentation and Access: A Latino/a Studies Perspective on Using Video Archives Carolyn Brown, American University This talk explores the possibilities and potential of using accessible
                    video news archives in two areas: immigration research in the field of
                    communication and documentary journalism. Prof. Brown speaks of the
                    significance of video news archives in her current film, The Salinas
                    Project, and discusses her continuing research on Latino/as and
                    immigration in the news. Carolyn Brown, American University Image Analysis for Media Study Michael Lesk, Rutgers University Focusing on television news coverage of the 9/11 attacks, this brief
                    talk outlines strategies for automatic quantitative analysis of
                    television news imagery. Michael Lesk, Rutgers University Live Dispatch: The Ethics of Audio Vision Media Coverage in Trauma
                    and the Legacy of Sound from Shell Shock to 9/11 Beatrice Choi, New York University What experiential narratives-sensory, aesthetic and political-are
                    invisible to those exposed to traumatic events? Considering September
                    11, 2001, the media coverage of the event is predominantly visual.
                    People drift in and out of news footage, covered in dust and ash as
                    they exclaim that witnessing the attacks was like watching a movie. In
                    contrast, the wailing of sirens, the staccato thud of feet running
                    from the stricken towers, and the chaotic overlap of voices break
                    through-sometimes even swallow-the visual narratives spun for 9/11.
                    For contemporary American traumatic events, this inquires into how
                    porous the sensory modalities are in experiencing and remembering
                    shock. How, after all, do sensory representations of traumatic events
                    leave in/visible marks on documentation? Ms. Choi addresses these
                    questions by exploring sound as an alternate modality, evoking a
                    different level of traumatic indexicality. Beatrice Choi, New York University 9/11 Flipbook and Quantitative Media Study Scott Blake, artist Scott Blake has created a flipbook consisting of images of United
                    Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the south tower of the World Trade
                    Center. Accompanying the images are essays written by a wide range of
                    participants, each expressing their personal experience of the
                    September 11th attacks. In addition, the authors of the essays were
                    asked to reflect on, and respond to, the flipbook itself. Not
                    surprisingly, the majority of the essayists experienced the events
                    through news network footage. Blake is distributing his 9/11 Flipbooks
                    to encourage a constructive dialog regarding the media's participation
                    in sensationalizing the tragedy. To further illustrate his point,
                    Blake conducted a media study using the 9/11 TV News Archive to count
                    the number of times major news networks showed the plane crashes,
                    building collapses and people falling from the towers on September 11,
                    2001. Scott Blake, artist Presentation of Fox5-NY 9/11 News Coverage & Remarks Dennis Swanson, President of Station Operations, Fox Television Mr. Swanson was President of WNBC-TV at the time of the September 11
                    attacks. He recalls his personal experiences and testifies to the
                    historical significance of an online television news archive,
                    especially for younger people whose memories of the attacks may be
                    hazy or nonexistent. Dennis Swanson, President of Station Operations, Fox Television  Watch a video summary of key events .   10-years ago: LEARNING FROM RECORDED MEMORY:

Domestic Television . It follows Billy, an extremely dimwitted, happy-go-lucky boy, and Mandy, a cynical, remorseless girl, who, after winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster , gain Grim, the mighty Grim Reaper , as their "best friend forever". Grim, who is reluctant to serve the two children, has access to supernatural items, spells, and other abilities that often lead Billy and Mandy to 
interact with otherworldly environments, characters, or situations. Billy & Mandy began as a series of segments on Grim & Evil , from which it was a spin-off, along with sister series Evil Con Carne , on August 24, 2001. Although the 2003 episodes were produced for Grim & Evil ,
 the show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003, to November 9, 
2007, on Cartoon Network. Two made-for-TV movies were also produced, Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure , which aired on March 30, 2007, and Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen , which aired on July 6, 2007. A crossover special with fellow Cartoon Network series, Codename: Kids Next Door , entitled "The Grim Adventures of the KND", aired on November 11, 2007. One more made-for-TV movie, Underfist: Halloween Bash , intended to serve as a pilot for a new spin-off series, aired on October 12, 2008. During its run, the series won two Emmy Awards and one Annie Award , with nominations for one Daytime Emmy Award , three Golden Reel Awards , and two other Annie Awards. Billy & Mandy has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise.

 After Billy and Mandy cheated at a limbo match against Grim (in 
retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he 
is enslaved in a permanently unwanted friendship with the children. [1] Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even 
fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time 
passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for 
Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a loveâhate relationship with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude. Billy and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to 
venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the Underworld ,
 or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous 
beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural 
abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals 
or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional 
monsters including Dracula , the Wolfman , and the bogeyman are also comically depicted in the series. Supporting characters include Irwin ( Vanessa Marshall ), Billy's nerdy best friend who has a crush on Mandy; Harold ( Richard Steven Horvitz ), Billy's father who shares his son's stupidity; Gladys ( Jennifer Hale ), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy ( Rachael MacFarlane ), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg ( Greg Eagles ), the local bully who has a sensitive side; Hoss Delgado ( Diedrich Bader ), an overly-intense "spectral exterminator" who hunts supernatural creatures; Nergal ( David Warner / Martin Jarvis ), a friendship-seeking demon who later marries Billy's aunt and bears a son, Nergal Jr. ( Debi Derryberry ); General Skarr ( Armin Shimerman ), Billy's ill-tempered next door neighbor who originated in the Evil Con Carne animated series; and Jeff (Maxwell Atoms), a giant spider constantly trying to win the approval of the arachnophobic Billy, whom he sees as his father. The show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end
 with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters 
sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, 
but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the 
show together.

Titled Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You , it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing trepanning with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to 
pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. 
The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the
 first annual TromAnimation Film Festival. [2] After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film to his YouTube channel, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage. While working on the first season of Cow and Chicken ,
 Atoms was approached by Hanna-Barbera executives for ideas for new 
short films. Among the ideas he presented to Hanna-Barbera was 
"Milkman", centering on an anthropomorphic, superhero milk carton who 
saves the missing children depicted on his back. Though the idea was 
rejected, executives were interested in Billy and Mandy, two characters 
that were to be featured in the project. [3] Atoms was prompted to devise a series centering on the two children. 
Feeling that the characters Billy and Mandy would not be enough to carry
 a show, he began devising a third character to round out the main cast.
 He was always fascinated by the idea of a little girl befriending the Devil or the grim reaper , but eventually settled on the latter, as Cartoon Network did not approve of depictions of the devil after Cow and Chicken . Atoms pitched the Billy & Mandy concept to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon , to which Cartoon Network approved the production of a short film 6 months later (which would become the short/pilot Meet the Reaper ). [3] The show was put into full production after the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called Cartoon Network's Big Pick which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000. [4] [5] The three final choices were The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy , Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? , and Longhair and Doubledome . [4] Out of the three, Billy & Mandy attained the most votes with 57%; Robot Jones came in second place at 23% while Longhair and Doubledome received 20% of the vote. [4] Originally part of Grim & Evil , Billy & Mandy served as the main show. In each episode, an Evil Con Carne short was put between two Grim shorts. [5] An original Evil Con Carne short was produced in 2000 after Meet the Reaper , but Cartoon Network wanted to combine the series, to have a "B cartoon" as a middle segment (similar to the Dial M For Monkey and The Justice Friends shorts in Dexter's Laboratory , or the I Am Weasel segment on Cow and Chicken ). [3] On occasion, it was the other way around, with two Evil shorts and one Grim short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend . Another batch of 13 half-hour episodes were produced for Grim & Evil ,
 but on June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave 
each their own half-hour program. The split came as a result of Cartoon 
Network wanting to move away from the old 7 minute segment format, and 
focus on two 11 minute segments per half hour instead. [3] After both series aired their respective new seasons, the network gave 
Atoms a decision to continue one series, while the other would be 
dropped from production. Atoms opted to continue Billy & Mandy and accepted the network's decision, as he considered running both shows stressful. [3] Evil Con Carne characters occasionally appear on The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy .
 General Skarr was introduced into the show as a recurring character 
beginning in Season 2's "Skarred for Life", where he became Billy's new 
next-door neighbor. [6] In "Company Halt", the ninth episode of the final season which also functions as the true series finale for Evil Con Carne ,
 Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization 
and convince Skarr to rejoin them, but their plans are ultimately foiled
 by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal 
person. [7] On March 20, 2022, Craig McCracken revealed that years ago on Cartoon Network there were plans for a spinoff series titled Cheeseburger featuring Fred Fredburger and Cheese from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends , but the idea never gained traction. [8] Atoms confirmed in 2021 that the three main characters of the show are on the autism spectrum , having been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome late in life. He likened Mandy to "the cold, rational way [he] learned 
to view the world in order to survive", Billy to "the fun and joyous 
inner-world where [Atoms likes] to spend [his] time" and Grim to "the 
moral mediator between the two." [9] Reception Reception Common Sense Media gave the show a 3/5 star rating and stated that it has "goofy 
punchlines and obscure cultural references" and recommends the viewer 
age be at least 8 years old.

Internet Archive Blogs A blog from the team at archive.org Blog Announcements archive.org About Events Developers Donate Defining Web pages, Web sites and Web captures Posted on October 23, 2016 by Vinay Goel The Internet Archive has been archiving the web for 20 years and has preserved billions of webpages from millions of websites. These webpages are often made up of, and link to, many images, videos, style sheets, scripts and other web objects. Over the years, the Archive has saved over 510 billion such time-stamped web objects , which we term web captures. We define a webpage as a valid web capture that is an HTML document, a plain text document, or a PDF. A domain on the web is an owned section of the internet namespace, such as google.com or archive.org or bbc.co.uk. A host on the web is identified by a fully qualified domain name or FQDN that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System. The FQDN consists of the following parts: hostname and domain name. Â As an example, in case of the host blog.archive.org , its hostname is blog and the host is located within the domain archive.org . We define a website to be a host that has served webpages and has at least one incoming link from a webpage belonging to a different domain. As of today, the Internet ArchiveÂ officially holds 273 billion webpages from over 361 million websites, taking up 15 petabytes of storage.

His show was among the most-watched programmes in the UK, and his audience was more than 21 million in 1971. The Benny Hill Show was also exported to many countries around the world. He received a BAFTA Award for Best Writer and a Rose d'Or, and was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance and for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Variety. Outside television, Hill starred in films including the Ealing comedy Who Done It? (1956), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and The Italian Job (1969). His comedy song, "Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)", was 1971's number one Christmas song on the UK Singles Chart, and earned Hill an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 1972. Hill's Legacy: In 1998, Hill was featured in the Heroes of Comedy programme, and in 2002, he was ranked the third greatest British comedian of the 20th century, after Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. In 2006, Hill was voted number 17 in a poll of TV's 50 Greatest Stars by the British public. On 28 December 2006, the documentary, Is Benny Hill Still Funny?, was broadcast. The programme featured an audience that comprised a cross-section of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of Little Britain, The Catherine Tate Show and Borat. The participants favourably rated a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hill's humour from his TV shows. In November 2021, The Benny Hill Show would feature in a Christmas schedule on Freeview, alongside other programmes, such as Beadle's About and Kenny Everett's New Year Specials. Benny Hill is still widely celebrated to this day. So contrary to what has been written above, let's remember his talents and celebrate, instead of trying to cancel him, there's too much of that nowadays! ...Less favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite  favorite ...

Contribute Contribute Contribute Contribute Privacy Policy Contribute (âContributeâ) is an online credit and debit card contributions
platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (âthe Websiteâ) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (âCFBâ) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically
collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the
following: The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a userâs Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,
Internet Explorer, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer. The date and time a user visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to
Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a userâs Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,
Internet Explorer, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer. The date and time a user visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to
Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The CFB uses this information to identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility
with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New Yorkâs Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFBâs work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFBâs work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the userâs express consent to the CFBâs
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contributeâs privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? Itâs the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your partyâs nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on âMeet the Candidatesâ in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an âexhausted ballot.â) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesnât help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who youâd choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get âexhaustedâ). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the âWrite-inâ line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections? Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results? The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day. However, these results will not include any absentee ballot votes. After they receive all absentee ballots, they will finish counting and release certified final results. You can find election results at the NYC Board of Elections website. Visit the Board of Elections website Vote by Mail Back to Top Can I still vote in person if I request or submit an absentee ballot? If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Learn more about voting by mail Can I drop off my absentee ballot at my poll site? Yes! You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any NYC poll site. Ballot boxes will be available at the front desk. You can also drop off your ballot at any Board of Elections office .

The Board of Electionsâ ballot tracker will let you know the status of your ballot after you submit a request. It will also let you know if they have received your completed ballot and whether itâs valid. Track your ballot Can I fix my absentee ballot if I made a mistake? The Board of Elections is required by law to notify you if there is a curable error on your ballot envelope, such as a missing or incorrect signature. If there is a fixable error on your ballot, they will contact you by mail, email, and phone (if available) within 1 day of discovering the error. You will then have a minimum of 5 days to correct the error by returning a signed affirmation. Learn more about voting by mail Can I vote absentee in person? Sounds strange, but itâs true! You can vote absentee in person at your boroughâs Board of Elections office. Offices are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, and on the weekend prior to Election Day.

You have the right to vote as long as you are a registered voter in line by 9pm on Election Day. Learn more about Election Day Will I know who won on Election Day?

It is the campaignâs responsibility to report your contribution correctly and claim it for matching funds. What happens to my money when I contribute to a campaign? Candidates running for local New York City office have the option of using Contribute as their online fundraising platform. When you donate on Contribute, your contribution is sent directly to the campaignâs bank account via the siteâs third-party credit card processor, Stripe.

The CFB does not charge campaigns to use Contribute. Stripe , the credit card processor Contribute uses to direct funds to your bank account, charges a nominal and standard fee (2.9% + $0.30) for each contribution.

If you ran in a previous election, you cannot reuse an old Stripe account. After logging into your Contribute account, you must create a new Stripe account by using an email address that is easily accessible by the candidate, treasurer, and anyone else monitoring your Contribute account, as time-sensitive emails may be sent by Stripe to this email address. How do I sign up for Contribute? 1.Â Â Â  Sign up at contribute.nycvotes.org/signup After registering with the CFB, your campaign will have access to Contribute.

You will need to complete fields such as: Type of business: Select âNonprofit Organizationâ Legal business name: Enter the committeeâs name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select âPolitical Organizationâ How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select âWithin One Dayâ Executive Details: The campaignâs Stripe account should be created by the candidate (strongly recommended), treasurer, or another campaign representative with significant managerial control.

(For example, home address and the last four digits of Social Security Number.) Credit Card Statement Details: In this section, you will be able to customize how contributions made to your campaign will appear on your contributorsâ bank statements.

Click the Authorize access to this account button to complete the registration form for Stripe. 5. Receive Contribute link After creating your Stripe account, you will receive an email that confirms that your Contribute account has been connected to Stripe, and that contains your unique Contribute link. This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the monthâs total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART? After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds. IMPORTANT: Do not manually enter C-SMART contributions received via Contribute. If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.Â Â Â  Sign in to your campaignâs Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.Â Â Â  Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page.

Contribute will alert you if you have any contributions that have not been uploaded to C-SMART. You will be able to use the upload function only if there are contributions that have not yet been uploaded to C-SMART. What should I do after uploading contributions to C-SMART? 1.Â Â Â  Review each contribution in C-SMART Review the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to ensure that each contribution was uploaded. For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.Â Â Â  Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.Â Â Â  Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.Â Â Â  Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contributionâs C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for âStripe â NYC Votes Contributeâ to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page? A fundraiser is an event that is organized and sponsored by your campaign. For each fundraiser held by your campaign, you must disclose the following information to the CFB: Date of the event Location of the event List of all contributions received at the event Any persons or organization(s) other than the campaign hosting the event Itemized list of all expenditures related to the event, whether the campaign or another host paid for them You can create distinct contribution pages on Contribute for fundraisers organized by your campaign.

From here, you will find links to the event page, social media tools to share through different platforms, and HTML codes that can be used to embed the event page on your campaignâs website, emails, and social media pages. The Status of the event will now be Open , meaning contributions can now be collected for this event. IMPORTANT: After an event has occurred, it should be closed to stop new contributions from being made. From the Edit tab in the eventâs administrative page, select Close Event . All contributions received via the Fundraising Event feature must be reported to the CFB within the disclosure period in which the event occurred.

From the Edit tab you can update event details and close, open, or delete the event. Deleting an event is only possible if no contributions have been made for that event. This action cannot be undone. You will receive an email for any modifications made to your event. If event details are modified after the event has been uploaded to C-SMART, use the details in this email to make the necessary changes to the event in C-SMART. If you accidentally close an event before it has occurred, the event can be re-opened. Contact your Candidate Services liaison if you need to re-open an event. To customize the contribution amounts for your event page, click on theâ¯Toolsâ¯tab on the eventâs administrative page and update the amounts under Custom Amount Tool. Make sure to click Save New Defaults when youâre finished. If you would like to show fewer than five contribution amounts, enter $0 in any of the contribution amount fields.

Contributions made to events must also be claimed for match like any other eligible contribution. Note: As with other contributions received in Contribute, Stripe processing fees are deducted from contributions received through fundraising event pages. Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time? From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors? For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer.

To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each eventâs administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time? Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committeesâ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committeesâ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committeeâs Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaignâs account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFBâs public disclosure requirements? Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, âdoing businessâ status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaignâs responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. How can we help you?

Itâs the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your partyâs nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on âMeet the Candidatesâ in the navigation up top.

You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an âexhausted ballot.â) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesnât help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who youâd choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get âexhaustedâ). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid.

To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the âWrite-inâ line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases.

Bank Details: Enter your committeeâs bank account number and routing number to set up transfers for contributions received. You must use the same bank account on file with the CFB. Two-Step Authentication: Choose one of Stripeâs security methods to protect your account. Save your Stripe account: Create your login credentials for your Stripe dashboard. Use these credentials to log in directly at www.stripe.com. You can choose to use the same email address linked to your Contribute account, but it is not necessary. Click the Authorize access to this account button to complete the registration form for Stripe. 5. Receive Contribute link After creating your Stripe account, you will receive an email that confirms that your Contribute account has been connected to Stripe, and that contains your unique Contribute link. This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account?  Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the monthâs total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART?  After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds. IMPORTANT: Do not manually enter C-SMART contributions received via Contribute. If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.Â Â Â  Sign in to your campaignâs Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.Â Â Â  Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. Contributions received via Fundraising Events will be included in the total number of contributions that appear under this alert. To upload data from Contribute, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Contribute will alert you if you have any contributions that have not been uploaded to C-SMART. You will be able to use the upload function only if there are contributions that have not yet been uploaded to C-SMART. What should I do after uploading contributions to C-SMART?  1.Â Â Â  Review each contribution in C-SMART Review the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to ensure that each contribution was uploaded. For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.Â Â Â  Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.Â Â Â  Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.Â Â Â  Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contributionâs C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART?  In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for âStripe â NYC Votes Contributeâ to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?  A fundraiser is an event that is organized and sponsored by your campaign. For each fundraiser held by your campaign, you must disclose the following information to the CFB: Date of the event Location of the event List of all contributions received at the event Any persons or organization(s) other than the campaign hosting the event Itemized list of all expenditures related to the event, whether the campaign or another host paid for them You can create distinct contribution pages on Contribute for fundraisers organized by your campaign. This will allow you to accept contributions for those fundraisers and simplify the reporting of the eventâs name, location, date, and contributions received. 1.Â Â Â  View events and create a new event From the Fundraising Events tab you can create, view, and manage upcoming and past events. 2.Â Â Â  Enter event details Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*); Venue Name and Start and End Time are optional fields. 3.Â Â Â  Share event page with supporters After successfully creating an event, you will be directed to the Share tab found in the eventâs administrative page. From here, you will find links to the event page, social media tools to share through different platforms, and HTML codes that can be used to embed the event page on your campaignâs website, emails, and social media pages. The Status of the event will now be Open , meaning contributions can now be collected for this event. IMPORTANT: After an event has occurred, it should be closed to stop new contributions from being made. From the Edit tab in the eventâs administrative page, select Close Event . All contributions received via the Fundraising Event feature must be reported to the CFB within the disclosure period in which the event occurred. How do I edit and review fundraising event pages?  1.Â Â Â  Edit event If you would like to make changes to an event, from the eventâs administrative page select the Edit tab. From the Edit tab you can update event details and close, open, or delete the event. Deleting an event is only possible if no contributions have been made for that event. This action cannot be undone. You will receive an email for any modifications made to your event. If event details are modified after the event has been uploaded to C-SMART, use the details in this email to make the necessary changes to the event in C-SMART. If you accidentally close an event before it has occurred, the event can be re-opened. Contact your Candidate Services liaison if you need to re-open an event. To customize the contribution amounts for your event page, click on theâ¯Toolsâ¯tab on the eventâs administrative page and update the amounts under Custom Amount Tool. Make sure to click Save New Defaults when youâre finished. If you would like to show fewer than five contribution amounts, enter $0 in any of the contribution amount fields. Amounts of $0 will not appear on your fundraising event page. 2.Â Â Â  Manage and view events Return to the Fundraising Events tab to view your events. Events can be sorted by Event Date and Time , Event Name , Status , and Total Contributions by clicking on each header. Click PreviewÂ to view the event page that will be shared with contributors. To return to the eventâs administrative page, click the hyperlinked event name or click the gear icon and select Edit . 3.Â Â Â  Review fundraising events and contributions From the Contributions tab on the eventâs administrative page, individual contributions can be sorted by Date and Time received, Name of contributor, and Amount contributed. From this page, you can also export the list of contributions received through this event page as a CSV file. Like any other contribution received through Contribute, contributions made to events must be reported within the same disclosure period in which they are received and uploaded directly to C-SMART. Contributions made to events must also be claimed for match like any other eligible contribution. Note: As with other contributions received in Contribute, Stripe processing fees are deducted from contributions received through fundraising event pages. Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time?  From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors?  For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer. When refunding a prohibited contribution via Stripe, remember that to be considered resolved, the refund cannot be pending and must have cleared your campaign bank account . From your Stripe Dashboard: Find the contribution to be refunded in the Payments overview page. Click the â¢â¢â¢ icon to the right of the charge and select Refund charge. Enter the amount to be refunded. The default is a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a different amount to be refunded. Select a reason for the refund. If you select Other, you must provide an explanatory note that is attached to the refund. Note: the reason entered is for your campaign and Stripeâs records only and is not shared with the CFB. Click Refund . To document the refund in C-SMART, once it has cleared your bank account: While in Stripe, under âPayments - Refundedâ, search for your contributor by first name, last name. Identify the specific contribution that was refunded. Click directly on that contribution to open the refund details. Save the entire refund details screen as a PDF by clicking âCTRL+Pâ and then instead of printing, select âSave as PDF. In C-SMART, add the monetary contribution refund. You can enter âStripeâ as the Check Number. Upload the entire PDF of your Stripe refund details as your refund documentation in C-SMART. For instructions, see Monetary Contribution Refund Documentation in C-SMART Help. How do I embed Contribute on my campaignâs website and customize contribution amounts?  In the Tools tab of your account page, you will be able to set the contribution amounts that appear on your contribution page. You will also find the HTML code to embed your contribution page on your website, in your campaign emails, and on your social media pages. To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each eventâs administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time?  Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committeesâ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committeesâ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committeeâs Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaignâs account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States?  Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFBâs public disclosure requirements?  Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, âdoing businessâ status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaignâs responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. Still have questions? Contact us on social media!
