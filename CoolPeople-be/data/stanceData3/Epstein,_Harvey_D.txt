Lewis | April 24, 2025 05:27 PM ET By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 05:27 PM ET Immigration Nonprofits News & Politics Donald Trump New York City Republicans in Congress are starting to come after nonprofits in New York who sponsor “Know Your Rights” training for immigrants as the federal government continues to deport large numbers of immigrants. The House Committee on Homeland Security last week launched a probe into the Chinese-American Planning Council, also known as CPC, over the social services nonprofit’s role in a March 8 Know Your Rights training in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Republican Rep. Mark Greene, the chair of the committee, sent a letter to CPC President and CEO Wayne Ho alerting him of the committee’s investigation into “the potential use of federal funds by non-government organizations (NGOs) to facilitate illegal immigration.” Greene requested that Ho send a slew of documents to facilitate that investigation, including any materials used for the preparation of the March 8 training seminar or any other similar trainings since November of last year, copies of federal grant applications from 2021 on, and information on how CPC has spent federal funding. The letter offers an April 30 deadline to provide the requested documents. According to the letter, the CPC has received more than $900,000 in funding from the federal government since 2022. The investigation into the nonprofit could put future funding and grant applications in jeopardy, depending on its outcome. The CPC caught the attention of congressional Republicans thanks to an “undercover” video released by the Oversight Project , a right-wing government accountability group that is part of the Heritage Foundation. Citing footage taken by the rightwing news outfit Muckraker of the Know Your Rights training in March, the Oversight Project described the seminar as a “radical activist meeting” where “antideportation leftists coordinate efforts to stop ICE and law enforcement from enforcing the nation’s immigration laws” and called the CPC a “radical New York-based NGO” that “should have no place receiving taxpayer dollars as they engage in anti-law, pro-illegal immigration activism.” Know Your Rights trainings have become increasingly common in New York and around the country since President Donald Trump’s election and his promise of mass deportations. Many Democratic lawmakers have hosted or sponsored such seminars, in which organizers teach immigrants about the legal rights they can exercise when interacting with immigration agents. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in particular, has come under fire for hosting a training in which she advised immigrants that they don’t need to open their doors for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents – which is both true and legal if the agents don’t have a warrant signed by a judge. But conservatives have called for an investigation into the seminar and have accused Ocasio-Cortez of illegally aiding undocumented immigrants. The news of the House committee’s letter to the CPC was first reported by the right-wing news website The Daily Caller, but the outlet did not indicate that it reached out to the nonprofit for comment. In his first public comment since receiving the letter, Ho defended his organization and the training it sponsored. “Our trainings help community members better understand their rights on a range of services, including education, healthcare, employment, housing, immigration, and more,” Ho said in a statement to City & State. “CPC fully adheres to all laws. Our trainings do not direct anyone to do anything or to evade the law, but rather to inform participants of their constitutional rights which they may choose to exercise.” He added that the nonprofit remains “committed to transparency and constructive dialogue with decision makers.” Assembly Member Grace Lee, who co-sponsored the March training and represents part of Chinatown, slammed the investigation into the CPC. “The Trump administration’s sham investigation into CPC is a fascist move to undermine an organization providing critical services to the Asian American community,” Lee told City & State. “The Trump administration continues to drive policies that dismantle support systems our communities rely on and make the Asian American community suffer." The video from the Oversight Project that prompted the congressional action also heavily featured Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents Lower Manhattan, was featured on promotional material for the training and has requested federal funding for the organization. A spokesperson for Goldman did not directly address the targeting of the CPC, but defended the type of training it participated in. “This Administration is sending undercover ICE officers wearing masks to arrest people, ‘mistakenly’ flying legal residents to super max prisons in foreign countries, and wrongly detaining American citizens,” Goldman spokesperson Madison Andrus said in a statement to City & State. “The Congressman would happily offer anyone in this Administration a similar tutorial on due process rights and the rule of law so that they can stop breaking the law and recklessly terrorizing legal residents in this country.” A spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul, whom the video also featured, similarly did not directly address the apparent targeting of a prominent nonprofit in New York over immigration rights. But the spokesperson, Avi Small, offered support for efforts to educate people on their rights. “Governor Hochul has repeatedly said New York can help federal immigration officials arrest violent criminals, but will never support policies that rip families apart or target innocent children,” Small said. “Due process is the foundation of the American legal system, and Governor Hochul believes every single person deserves to know the rights they are granted under the United States Constitution.” Share This: NEXT STORY: DC 37, Tish James rebuke Cuomo in backing Adrienne Adams for mayor Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Immigration House GOP targets NY nonprofit over Know Your Rights training Republicans in Congress are investigating the Chinese-American Planning Council for sponsoring a seminar to educate immigrants about their rights when dealing with ICE.

Lewis | April 4, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 4, 2025 Albany Agenda News & Politics New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul has made a lot of political hay over her leadership of the state Democratic Party, emerging triumphant from victories at the congressional level and in other races across the state, and revitalizing the nascent party apparatus in the state. Just don’t ask her to weigh in on the decision of New York City Mayor Eric Adams – a one-time ally once seen as a potential standard bearer for the party on the national stage – to abandon the Democratic line in favor of running as an independent. After a federal judge officially dismissed the corruption case against him earlier this week, Adams announced that he would not run in the Democratic primary and would instead petition to appear on the November ballot as an independent. He made a point to say he’s not changing his registration and would remain a Democrat in the voter rolls, but he also was quickly seen alongside conservative influencers after his announcement. Asked about Adams’ change of heart – a decision made as he lagged far behind in primary polling, allies abandoned him for other candidates and amid stagnant fundraising – Hochul first tried to brush off the significance of New York’s second most prominent Democrat ditching the party. “One thing I love about my party, we have a lot of different opinions and voices and individuals, and I have to respect all of them,” the governor said in relation to her role as the head of the state Democratic Party. When City & State pointed out that Adams was no longer running as a member of her party, Hochul deflected. “People do what they need to do,” she said. “I will always run as a Democrat if anybody’s wondering.” The apparently flippant attitude belies her role as leader of the state Democratic Party, one that she takes great pride in during election season. She dedicated significant time, money and resources to help the party win back several House seats in 2024 after a disastrous 2022 for which national leaders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi blamed Hochul. She worked alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to support Democratic candidates and priorities, and she built out a state party that for years served mainly as another campaign arm for the governor. “There's never been a governor in New York State that took so seriously the title of leader of the state party,” Hochul declared on CNN last year, one of many cable news appearances she made to tout her efforts. Hochul seemingly was not wearing that hat when she spoke to reporters on Thursday. She insisted that she has “a lot more to do than worry about who's running for mayor today and tomorrow, (and on) what party line.” Which, admittedly, is true. She’s in the middle of negotiating the state budget, which is now several days late, and the state is anticipating deep federal cuts, among other issues of concern. “I’m not going to stand here and say, ‘Oh my God, he did something else,’” Hochul said of Adams. Adams’ decision isn’t the first time this has happened either, a fact that Hochul pointed at as well. She referenced former Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, a former head of the state Democratic Party who defied that same party after losing in a primary in 2021 and ran a write-in campaign against the Democratic nominee India Walton, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Brown’s decision at the time attracted controversy from progressives in the party, especially after state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs declined to endorse the nominee and instead tacitly compared Walton – a Black woman – to Ku Klux Klan leader David Dukes. Jacobs told City & State that he doesn’t have any thoughts now on Adams’ decision to run for reelection as an independent.

Lewis By Rebecca C. Lewis Rebecca C. Lewis | April 4, 2025 By     Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda News & Politics News & Politics News & Politics News & Politics New York State New York State New York State New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul has made a lot of political hay over her leadership of the state Democratic Party, emerging triumphant from victories at the congressional level and in other races across the state, and revitalizing the nascent party apparatus in the state. Just don’t ask her to weigh in on the decision of New York City Mayor Eric Adams – a one-time ally once seen as a potential standard bearer for the party on the national stage – to abandon the Democratic line in favor of running as an independent. After a federal judge officially dismissed the corruption case against him earlier this week, Adams announced that he would not run in the Democratic primary and would instead petition to appear on the November ballot as an independent. He made a point to say he’s not changing his registration and would remain a Democrat in the voter rolls, but he also was quickly seen alongside conservative influencers after his announcement. Asked about Adams’ change of heart – a decision made as he lagged far behind in primary polling, allies abandoned him for other candidates and amid stagnant fundraising – Hochul first tried to brush off the significance of New York’s second most prominent Democrat ditching the party. “One thing I love about my party, we have a lot of different opinions and voices and individuals, and I have to respect all of them,” the governor said in relation to her role as the head of the state Democratic Party. When City & State pointed out that Adams was no longer running as a member of her party, Hochul deflected. “People do what they need to do,” she said. “I will always run as a Democrat if anybody’s wondering.” The apparently flippant attitude belies her role as leader of the state Democratic Party, one that she takes great pride in during election season. She dedicated significant time, money and resources to help the party win back several House seats in 2024 after a disastrous 2022 for which national leaders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi blamed Hochul. She worked alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to support Democratic candidates and priorities, and she built out a state party that for years served mainly as another campaign arm for the governor. “There's never been a governor in New York State that took so seriously the title of leader of the state party,” Hochul declared on CNN last year, one of many cable news appearances she made to tout her efforts. Hochul seemingly was not wearing that hat when she spoke to reporters on Thursday. She insisted that she has “a lot more to do than worry about who's running for mayor today and tomorrow, (and on) what party line.” Which, admittedly, is true.

Adrienne!” at a major union endorsement rally on Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James stole some wind from the sails of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s inevitability campaign. Cuomo has been dominant in attracting major endorsements in the race for New York City mayor. Influential unions including 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council have in recent weeks backed the former governor, who’s polling with double-digit leads above any of his competitors. But District Council 37 – New York City’s largest public sector union that represents 150,000 members – broke up that pattern this week, endorsing New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. The nod gave her campaign a much-needed boost and one that offered her endorsers plenty of opportunity to take aim at the former governor. The union endorsed Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani as their second choice and state Sen. Zellnor Myrie as their third. In addition to James, Adams was also endorsed by CWA Local 1180 and Unite Here Local 100. After becoming the last candidate to enter the race , Adams is behind in fundraising and polling in the single digits . That puts her far behind not just Cuomo, but also Mamdani, who has maintained second place in most recent polls. Nearly every mayoral campaign has focused their ire on Cuomo as soon as he entered the race in March, if not earlier. It hasn’t seemed to make a dent in polls so far. Cuomo went before the union’s screening committee for their endorsement, executive director Henry Garrido said. “He made his case for why, in the same day and age as the Trump administration, he should be the solution,” Garrido said. “I think our members in the screening committee remained unconvinced.” Garrido made it clear the union members haven’t forgotten cost-cutting changes to the pension system under then-Gov. Cuomo that reduced benefits for some retirees. “Tier 6 is fresh on the minds of so many city workers,” he said. Asked if he was worried that by not endorsing Cuomo, the union would be at risk of Cuomo making the union’s life “hell” in future contract negotiations if he does become mayor, Garrido suggested that Cuomo’s vindictive reputation is exactly why he wasn’t their pick. “Actually what you just said is the prime example of why he’s not here,” he told a reporter. “I’m not afraid of anybody coming in here. I am here to represent the people who elected me to do what I think is right. This is what’s right.” James, who conducted the sexual misconduct investigation that led to Cuomo’s resignation, made thinly veiled comments that seemed aimed at Cuomo too. (Cuomo has denied the sexual harassment allegations against him.) “(Adams is) stepping up at a time of chaos and confusion. Not out of political motivation – or political revenge or even redemption,” James said. James also said she would be campaigning with Adams at Black churches – something she suggested “certain candidates” do in a bid for votes. “We don’t go to churches just around election time,” James said of herself and Adams. “We go to church every Sunday.” Cuomo has so far performed better than any of his rivals among Black voters in polls, and he’s received endorsements from Black clergy leaders. Some of his first public reappearances after resigning in 2021 were at Black churches. Asked about James’ comment, the Cuomo campaign referred City & State to a statement from Bishop Orlando Findlayter, the pastor at New Hope Christian Fellowship and a Cuomo endorser. Findlayter said that Cuomo “stood with the Black community during our most difficult days. …I hope Speaker Adams, as someone who understands the weight of leadership, will reflect on the importance of honesty and unity as we all work toward a better future for our communities.” Related articles Endorsements in the 2025 New York City mayoral race Myrie and Mamdani weren’t at the Adams-focused rally, but their campaigns told City & State they’re thrilled to have the union’s second and third-choice endorsements. “We look forward to hitting the trail with them in the future,” Myrie spokesperson Olivia Lapeyrolerie said. “We’re honored to have their support.” “Last night at our delegates’ meeting, we announced a whole slate of candidates that we will be supporting. But today we’re here to announce our endorsement for the next mayor of the city of New York: Adrienne Adams,” Garrido said. From fighting for funding for libraries and cultural institutions to helping to stave off layoffs at the Brooklyn Museum, Garrido said, “She was there for us at every single step of the way. We are going to be there for her when she becomes the next mayor of the city of New York.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Endorsements in the 2025 New York City mayoral race Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Politics DC 37, Tish James rebuke Cuomo in backing Adrienne Adams for mayor The endorsements give the City Council speaker’s campaign a much-needed jolt of momentum.

Lewis | April 22, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 22, 2025 Budget Albany Agenda News & Politics Kathy Hochul New York State Speaking to reporters during the second week of April, Gov. Kathy Hochul suggested that New Yorkers don’t care if the budget is late. At the time, it was a little over a week past the April 1 deadline to pass a new spending plan. Lawmakers have now passed the seventh budget extender, as the budget is more than three weeks late. A new poll from Siena college suggests that average New York voters are in fact worried about the fact that the budget has not yet passed. Luckily for Hochul, though, many also indicated they’re chill with her holding it up over her non-fiscal policy priorities. On April 10, Hochul said that New Yorkers outside the state capital “aren't watching their clocks and their calendars” when it comes to the budget. “I'm not concerned about process, I'm concerned about results,” the governor said as she defended her fourth late budget in a row. It’s how state leaders have often defended late budgets in recent years – outside of the politically plugged in, most people care more about a good budget than one that passes on time. The new poll from Siena College suggests that isn’t necessarily the case. A vast majority – a whopping 72% – of voters surveyed from April 14 through April 16 said they were concerned about the fact that the spending plan had not yet passed. Among that, 31% said they were very concerned about the delay. And only 2% said they had no opinion on the matter. Hochul may have had a point that many New Yorkers are not paying close attention as only half said they knew that leaders had blown past the legal April 1 deadline for the budget. But once informed, they certainly indicated they cared. Still, the poll bolstered Hochul’s assertion that voters want a good budget more than an one that’s on time. Of the four non-fiscal policy priorities the governor has fought strongly, at least a plurality of voters said they agreed with Hochul holding up the budget to ensure they passed. A 61% majority of voters polled said they supported her bid to ban cellphones at schools. Of those, a plurality of 48% said Hochul was right to delay the budget over it. On discovery, a plurality of 43% of New Yorkers surveyed said they supported Hochul’s pitch to “clarify” the law governing evidence sharing in criminal trials. Of those, a majority 55% said that the governor should be delaying the budget to make sure lawmakers approve the changes. When it comes to expanding the state’s involuntary commitment laws, a plurality of 45% voters agreed with the proposal as well as agreeing with Hochul on holding the budget to include it. The only exception is Hochul’s late attempt to include a measure that would make it a crime to hide your identity with a mask while intimidating someone. Although a strong majority support the proposal, a slight plurality said that the governor should not delay the budget over it. And of the three, it is the policy that Hochul has seemed to publicly push for the least. Speaking to reporters over the weekend, she even suggested that the measure may get addressed during the legislative session outside the budget. The governor has made no similar concessions about her other three priorities. Although the poll shows that New Yorkers do care about a late budget, a spokesperson for Hochul still viewed the numbers as vindication for her position. “The numbers are clear: not only do New Yorkers support Governor Hochul’s agenda – they also agree it’s worth holding up the budget to fix our discovery laws, expand mental health care and create distraction-free schools,” said spokesperson Avi Small.

George Santos is set to get sentenced today for the litany of fraud he was convicted of. Prosecutors have asked for seven years, which unfortunately means that any potential papal candidacy that the famed fabulist might have considered probably goes right out the window. Outlandish, you say? With Santos, there is no such thing. New York’s Cardinal Timothy Dolan was more seriously floated as a longshot contender to be the next pope, which could bring some suicide humor to the Vatican. (No seriously, check out the Catholic Conference’s “13 Reasons Why” reference about Medical Aid in Dying.) Either way, Dolan is headed to Rome to participate in the best viral marketing campaign for a movie in history. But while the world is focused on the conclave in the Italian city, New York’s own Rome made some news this week too. WINNERS: Jeffrey Lanigan - While the world’s eyes will soon gaze towards the Roman sky for white smoke, another Rome is saying “we have yogurt!” Chobani will be opening a new $1.2 billion factory in Oneida County’s Rome . The 1,000 jobs that will be created are certainly music to Rome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan’s ears. An added benefit, the doubling of Chobani’s New York yogurt operation opens a new lucrative market for upstate dairy farmers. Maybe Roberto Gualtieri, mayor of the Italian Rome, should pay Lanigan a visit to talk trade. Adrienne Adams - One Adams is on the rise in New York City’s mayoral race, and it’s not Eric. Sure, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is behind in fundraising, stuck in the single-digit polling swamp and is running out of time to catch up to other candidates. But a major union endorsement from District Council 37 gave her campaign a jolt of energy this week, and Attorney General Letitia James will be hitting the campaign trail with her too. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, still dominates the polls and is swimming in dough. Jennifer Connolly - Preston High School Principal Jennifer Connolly saw her job – and the education of 600 students – saved this week when the philanthropic arm of Bally’s purchased the Bronx site as the Catholic charter faced closure at the end of the year. Think of the kids, right? And also maybe think of the casino license you’re hoping to get at your nearby golf course? That part feels…not as inspiring…but hey, the school is saved! LOSERS: Robin Dalton - What goes around comes around? Several years after texting a police chief during a Black Lives Matter protest to “arrest those fuckers” and to “please please please pretty please arrest someone,” former Saratoga Springs public safety commissioner Robin Dalton was arrested herself after allegedly shoplifting from a Walmart. While the BLM protesters were later vindicated by a report from the state Attorney General’s office deeming Dalton and other officials’ actions to be unconstitutional, stealing $100 of merchandise from the country’s largest retailer seems like far less noble of a cause to get arrested over. Michael Fisher - The Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, led by Bishop Michael Fisher, agreed to a $150 million settlement to resolve more than 800 claims of sexual abuse, with a majority of abuse cases involving clerics . While there are still final approvals remaining, the deal may begin to offer some closure for the victims. Fisher’s not a cardinal, so he won’t be among the 10 U.S. members of the papal conclave, which may or may not feature Ralph Fiennes this year. Sean Duffy - There's putting your cards on the table, and then there's giving the dealer your social security number. Federal attorneys in the lawsuit that will decide congestion pricing’s fate accidentally filed a document listing flaws in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s case. The mistakenly filed letter was eventually removed from the court docket, but it will probably be tricky for Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to make the case against the controversial tolling program when his own peers think it’s built on quicksand.

Lewis | April 11, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 11, 2025 Budget Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda News & Politics New York State The king is dead, long live the queen. Gov. Kathy Hochul seemed to escalate the public rhetoric around budget talks on Thursday, taking barely-veiled jabs at her partners in the state Legislature and insisting that legislators needed a “strong individual” like her to get tricky policy done. Her new comments came after legislative leaders have similarly begun hinting at their frustrations more publicly than usual and as the delayed budget rolls into its 11th day past the deadline. At a testy press conference in her Albany office, Hochul reaffirmed her commitment to relaxing the state’s discovery laws and then highlighted policy achievements from her first three budgets to justify her fourth late budget in a row. It was proof, according to her, that a delayed spending plan was worth it if it meant forcing lawmakers to approve her agenda. “These are things that I have to put in my budget because they were not going to happen in the normal course of events, or at least the majority of them,” Hochul said. A governor has incredible control over the budget process, and both Hochul and her predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, took advantage of that fact to insert non-budgetary policy priorities in the spending document. It gives the executive leverage in ways usually not possible during the typical legislative process. On Thursday, Hochul characterized this as a necessity, asserting that she had to flex her power in order to compel the Legislature to get tricky or significant policy done. “They don't have an aggressive individual driving results, and that's me,” she said in reference to the Legislature. “I changed the culture.” And while New York voters elected their local officials to represent their interests, Hochul seemed to offer herself as the sole arbiter of the needs of New Yorkers. The governor said she has “respect” for individual lawmakers who represent their local districts, but she needs to “look at what 20 million New Yorkers want and what's important to them.” Hochul is certainly no stranger to contentious budget negotiations or fights with the Legislature. The state budget in 2023 got approved a little over a month past the April 1 deadline as the governor stood firm on making changes to bail reform, much like how she’s digging in on discovery now. That followed the state Senate’s historic rejection of her pick for the state’s top judge – a fight that grew so contentious that the governor at one point threatened to sue the Senate. But Albany observers agreed that her Thursday comments represented a notable shift in rhetoric, which has traditionally remained civil in public. One Albany insider called the governor’s tone “horrible” and predicted that her apparent disrespect for a coequal branch of government would come back to “nip her in the butt.” Another source noted that the governor has on some occasions spoken in a similar manner to legislative leadership during closed-door meetings, but she has never before used that tone in her public remarks. A different Albany observer said her comments were “a really unnecessarily provocative thing to say in the middle of a delicate negotiation.” And a fourth quipped that based on the comments, they believed the budget negotiations would drag on until May – of next year. A spokesperson for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie did not take too kindly to the governor’s words. “In 2024, nearly 800 bills passed both houses outside of the budget process addressing wide ranging issues affecting New Yorkers,” Mike Whyland, the spokesperson, said in a statement to City & State. “Clearly our members know their districts and they also know how to pass bills and get things done.” He added that Heastie has made it clear that his chamber is open to reviewing the discovery laws and doesn’t need to be “cajoled” into considering changes by putting them in the budget. A spokesperson for state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins did not offer comment. Heastie himself has been fairly direct and blunt with his budget commentary this year. He has never made a secret of his disdain for including policy in the spending plan, but earlier this week, he introduced legislation that would require legislators to be  paid during a budget delay if unrelated policy is included in the budget proposal. Right now, lawmakers don’t get paychecks until the budget passes, while the governor does. It was the first bill of its kind in recent memory and drew an icy response from Hochul’s office. The speaker has also openly expressed a degree of frustration over the negotiations over discovery, telling reporters this week that the Legislature had offered several compromises to Hochul and district attorneys, but that “at some point, we need them to compromise as well.” But Heastie has still made a point to broadcast that the legislative leaders and the governor were still working cooperatively towards a common goal and shared the same interests. “We are not trying to go to war with Gov. Hochul,” he told Spectrum News in an interview on Wednesday, also calling the governor “a good friend.” Hochul’s point about getting tricky policy done in the budget is not entirely without merit. For a long time, measures that may not have the votes to pass as standalone bills have gotten wrapped up into larger bills, whether the budget or an omnibus “big ugly” at the end of session. That provides some political cover to lawmakers who don’t want to be on the record voting in favor of a bill if their support is needed for passage, since another part of the bill usually contains something more favorable. But that is hardly the case all the time. For example, Cuomo tried multiple times to approve marijuana legalization in the state budget, which would give him the control to shape the program how he wanted. After it fell out of the budget more than once, the ex-governor all but dared lawmakers to pass the tricky legislation themselves. They did so as a standalone bill in 2021. Something similar happened when lawmakers approved sweeping rent laws at the end of the 2019 legislative session, another thorny issue that went unaddressed for much of that year. Since Hochul has taken office, lawmakers have also managed to approve long-stalled bills that for years had failed to gain traction. Three years in a row, lawmakers approved the 30-year-old Grieving Families Act to update the state’s ancient wrongful death laws. Hochul vetoed it each time. She did, however, sign the Climate Change Superfund Act last year, which lawmakers passed after several years and which was lauded as a major environmental victory by advocates. Hochul also signed the Clean Slate Act, which had been a major point of contention in Albany for several years and ultimately passed as a standalone bill in the Legislature in 2023.

Lewis | April 24, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 Budget Housing Homelessness Policy Albany Agenda New York State State leaders are negotiating a potential deal to include a long-desired rental voucher bill in the state budget, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions. It’s the most serious that discussions about the measure have gotten since legislators and housing advocates started pushing for it in earnest several years ago. Talk of the Housing Access Voucher Program emerged as the state budget nears the one month mark in tardiness. Although the measure has widespread support from tenant advocates and real estate interests alike, Gov. Kathy Hochul has repeatedly declined to back the measure in the past over the price tag. Advocates have called for a minimum of $250 million to fund the program that would provide rental vouchers to people at imminent risk of eviction and those currently experiencing homelessness. They estimate the total cost of the program to hit about $1 billion, while the governor’s office has asserted it would cost the state as much as $6 billion to implement. Both the state Senate and Assembly have included the voucher program and $250 million of funding in their one-house budget proposals for several years. Without support from the governor, though, the measure has fallen off the table time and again. Now, multiple sources with knowledge of negotiations say that Hochul has expressed a new openness to discussing the program and the potential for finding a compromise to include it in the late spending plan. One source suggested that while the governor’s office may not be offering a “warm” reception, the fact that they opened the door at all is a big step forward compared to years past. Although legislative leaders are discussing the prospect of a deal, details on what exactly that would look like remain murky. The biggest question that remains unanswered is exactly how much money the state would dedicate to the program in the case of a compromise. None of the sources briefed on discussions could even provide a ballpark estimate of what the governor may counter with, if not the full $250 million that advocates and lawmakers have pushed for. The Housing Access Voucher Program has continued to rack up support from a variety of interests, even those that often find themselves on opposing sides on other housing matters. Both Housing Committee chairs in the Legislature recently published a joint op-ed with Real Estate Board of New York President James Whelan and WIN CEO Christine Quinn in support of the measure. Several high profile unions – including 32BJ, the United Federation of Teachers and DC37 – also sent a new letter to Hochul on Thursday offering their support for the program as well, marking the first time that labor has offered public, unified advocacy for the bill. – With reporting by Austin C.

Lewis | April 10, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 10, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State Discovery Reform It seems at least one state lawmaker may be starting to get fed up with the budget delays around discovery and the alleged recalcitrance from district attorneys to negotiate over changes to the law. With details of those talks and proposed compromises still shrouded in mystery, state Sen. Cordell Cleare decided to introduce her own language on Wednesday. Just don’t read too much into it. Gov. Kathy Hochul, as part of her executive budget proposal, pitched tweaks to the discovery reforms approved in 2019. Although criminal justice advocates have argued that the changes would effectively allow for a wholesale rollback of the law , Hochul and prosecutors have said the amendments are necessary to address a stark increase in case dismissals in sometimes serious cases for what they call minor discovery infractions. Cleare’s new bill would codify the Court of Appeals decision in the case of People v. Bay . That 2023 decision established factors that a judge can consider when deciding on prosecutors’ compliance with discovery laws, which govern how and when prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense. It interpreted the current law to mean that a judge would not be required to automatically dismiss a case due to a discovery mistake if prosecutors exhibited due diligence and good faith in their efforts. Cleare’s legislation presents a number of factors that a judge can consider pursuant to Bay when deciding on whether a prosecutor exercised due diligence and good faith. Those include the extent of their efforts to comply with the discovery law, the amount of evidence already provided, the amount that is missing and the complexity of the case. “These factors provide a roadmap from which judges may fairly assess the prosecution's diligence,” a sponsor’s memo for the bill reads. The Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus – which Cleare belongs to – has advocated for adopting the Bay standard as a compromise on the debate around discovery. On Monday, caucus members rallied in support of the prospect. Assembly Member Michaelle Solages, the chair of the caucus, indicated at the time that she did not have specific language in mind yet, but she said she trusted legislative leaders to use Bay as “a guiding light” in negotiations. A spokesperson for Cleare referenced the caucus, and said that she consulted with other members about the legislation. “The position enumerated in the bill has been widely discussed for some time and the NYSABPRHAL Caucus (had) a Press Conference on it earlier in the week,” Chris LaBarge, Cleare’s legislative director, said in a statement. “Senator Cleare spoke to members/colleagues, advocates and practicing attorneys before introduction.” Solages did not return a request for comment about whether the caucus supports Cleare’s proposal. A spokesperson for state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said that Cleare introduced the bill independently and her legislation doesn’t represent the Senate Democratic conference’s current position on discovery. On the other side of the debate, district attorneys have said multiple times during recent trips to the state Capitol that while they support codifying Bay, that alone would not be enough. The prosecutors have pushed hard for Hochul’s proposal, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie charged on Tuesday that they haven’t been willing to compromise. The district attorneys want to add prejudice against a defendant as a third factor for a judge to consider on top of due diligence and good faith. It would allow a judge to determine whether the missing evidence has prejudice to the defendant, which they say is necessary to ensure that a case doesn’t get tossed over a minor piece of evidence that doesn’t impact the defense. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz suggested that prosecutors like herself might be willing to accept a codification of Bay, if that were expanded to include prejudice. She said that “Bay requirements plus the prejudice… sounds like the right way to go forward.” But Katz and other district attorneys have also emphasized the need to change the standard for discovery from all material “related” to a case, to all materials “relevant” to it. While the question of prejudice inherently goes hand-in-hand with a change like this, it would theoretically ease some of the burden and stress on prosecutors if the world of evidence they need to turn over gets narrowed. – With reporting from Austin C.

Lewis | April 17, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 17, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State The debate over discovery blessedly appears almost settled (barring a last-minute blowup while finalizing language), which hopefully means that the stalled state budget can finally start moving towards completion again. Legislative leaders and the governor had also managed to come to a tentative agreement earlier about banning cellphones in schools, which means they have two items down and… basically everything else left to go. On the policy side – much to the continued chagrin of Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who would prefer a straightforward spending plan – Gov. Kathy Hochul still has at least two more priority items she wants to get included: expanding the state’s involuntary commitment laws and enacting some version of a mask ban. Both have faced resistance in the state Senate and Assembly, much like the governor’s proposal to roll back parts of the 2019 reforms to the discovery laws. Although Hochul has recently spent much of her and her surrogates’ political capital and public appearances pushing the discovery issue, her team did put together a small press conference to discuss the involuntary commitment issue in Albany last week. It featured Dr. Ann Sullivan, commissioner of the state Office of Mental Health, as well as Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan and Albany County Executive Dan McCoy. “We hear from the mental health professionals that they need more tools… and we have far too many people who are dying on our streets,” Sheehan said. “Because let's put this out there – the alternative to the changes that the governor is proposing is that people will continue to die on our streets.” On the mask side, Hochul kept a potential ban out of her executive budget proposal released in January and only injected it to the conversation after budget negotiations had already begun. Supported by several civil rights and Jewish groups, the measure would reinstate a version of the state’s ban on wearing masks in public that lawmakers repealed during the pandemic. Supporters of the proposed ban charge that people are wearing masks in order to conceal their identities while intimidating others or engaging in hateful acts. They say that the issue has become more prevalent since the surge in pro-Palestine protests, although they are careful to say that the measure is not a response to any particular protest and is not meant to curb free speech. But opponents of the proposed mask ban like the New York Civil Liberties Union say it would have a chilling effect on protests and lead to disproportionate enforcement against people of color. The mask issue has deeply divided Democratic lawmakers in the Legislature, with some vehemently opposed and others advocating for it strongly. State Sen. James Skoufis, who sponsors the legislation that has served as the basis for negotiations so far, told City & State that he is “cautiously optimistic” that some version of the mask bill will make it into the final budget. As the budget talks have dragged on, other potential policy items have wormed their way into the discussion as well. As has happened in the past, opponents of the state’s substantial equivalency standards for private schools have quietly tried to include language to delay the implementation of new rules , or roll them back in other ways. The rules in particular affect yeshivas and have faced strong pushback from the Orthodox Jewish community. Legislators both for and against new changes suggested last week that the matter is not yet settled. Setting aside the rest of the finances of the budget, legislative leaders and the governor also have a $30 billion question to answer when it comes to funding the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s 2025–2029 capital plan. Officials have flitted around the question while making assurances that they’ll find the money and offering few concrete details. But at the very least, Heastie told reporters last week that he and his negotiating partners were close to agreeing on some form of tax hike to fund the plan. He described a menu of options at their disposal without disclosing where they landed, though a payroll tax hike on New York City businesses has emerged as the most likely option.

Jefferson | March 21, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson March 21, 2025 News & Politics Albany Agenda Donald Trump New York State President Donald Trump has gotten himself and the U.S. in a tangled trade war with Canada while belittling its leaders and sovereignty. He’s focused on the possible return of economic activity his tariffs might bring, but business leaders are gravely concerned with what this might mean, not just for commerce but for the longstanding ties between New York, Ontario and Quebec. What happens if our friendly neighbors to the north stop seeing us as friends? In a fight nominally over border security, Trump has already issued 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods , including aluminum and steel, and 10% tariffs on energy, which have left states like New York, coincidentally under Democratic control and in his crosshairs, to brace for very real economic impacts as the country in general experiences fiscal headwinds. Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have expressed concern about how the trade war with Canada might affect the state’s agricultural industry and ratepayers’ wallets; The governor has directed the state Department of Public Service, Department of State and Energy and Research Development Authority to examine the full effects of the tariffs on New York; those agencies estimated that the cost of electricity could increase by $42 million per year and the cost of heating oil could increase by $57 million per year. New York politicians respond In Congress, members of New York’s delegation with districts bordering Canada have predictably split down party lines when discussing what the tariffs mean for their constituents. Democrats have hammered home both the negative economic impact on New Yorkers and how this will fray the centuries-long relationship between New York and Canada. “All these tariffs will do is destroy centuries of goodwill between our neighbors, create a new consumer tax on Americans who are already struggling to make ends meet, and cost jobs,” Western New York Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy said in a statement. “I am doing everything I can to pressure President Trump to stand down from his trade wars, otherwise hardworking families will pay the price.” Neighboring Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy characterized the tariffs as a necessary evil to compel Canada to take border security more seriously. “When they were going to feel it from the pocket, then they got serious about it,” he said in an interview with WRGZ . North Country Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik has been mum on the issue as she prepares to leave Congress to become U.N. ambassador. Relations between New York and Canada have always been pleasant, and business leaders want it to stay that way. North Country Chamber of Commerce CEO Garry Douglas said he suspects that Republican elected officials are privately communicating to the White House that the tariffs need to be reconsidered. According to Douglas, the North Country gets most of its building materials and farming supplies from Quebec, a large portion of its energy from Canada and all of its natural gas from across the border. He calls it a “post-trade relationship.” “I would equate anything less than a full reconsideration and reversal of these tariffs on Canada as being like the guy who was being hit on the head by a hammer every five minutes, and now he starts being hit on the head by the hammer every 10 minutes instead,” Douglas said. Chris Kirkey, director of the Center for the Study of Canada and Institute on Québec Studies at SUNY Plattsburgh, said it may fall on Hochul to remind the president of the economic realities of the situation. The governor has already met with Trump more than once since he’s taken office. “I would expect that Governor Hochul will in the weeks to come, if these tariffs continue to play out, increasingly voice concern about, is this the way to go?” Kirkey said. Kirkey warned that Canadian business and government interests will look elsewhere if they can no longer trust that New York, and the U.S. more generally, will be reliable trading partners. Newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney just visited the United Kingdom and France, and Kirkey said that trip wasn’t just about policy. “He's in Europe, in part, to sort of not only speak to his government's principal objectives but to talk to trade partners such as France and the UK about deepening trade relations and diversifying greater trade relations so that Canada isn't so overly reliant on the United States,” he said. “Sometimes it may cost you to do that, but if your trade partner is proving to be unreliable, well then you look elsewhere.” Maple Leaf fury Unsurprisingly, Canada hasn’t taken kindly to the tariffs or to Trump’s insistence that they should be annexed by the U.S. and become “the 51st state,” and Canadian politicians, businesses and consumers are struggling to figure out how to react to Trump’s belligerent attacks. The Canadian government has issued its own retaliatory tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American products and threatened to increase them further if need be. Ontario Premier Doug Ford all but declared war on New York, threatening to cut off power provided by his province before eventually walking things back and speaking to Hochul. Quebec Minister of International Relations Martine Biron has taken a more conciliatory approach, telling City & State in a recent interview that the relationship between New York will ultimately endure, even if the current geopolitical situation results in both countries facing temporary hardships. “The exchange with New York is about $11 billion each year,” she said. “So it’s important. It’s an integrated chain of supply, so we need to work together. And if the tariffs are on and we break this chain of supply, it’s going to be difficult on both sides of the border.” But Trump doesn’t see it that way. “With Canada, we don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything from Canada, and yet it costs us $200 billion a year in subsidies to keep Canada afloat,” he told reporters on Friday . “So when I say they should be a state, I mean that. I really mean that.” In fact, Ontario is one of New York’s most important trading partners. Daniel Tisch, director of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, is well aware of the gravity of the situation. “The interdependence is huge,” Tisch said. But he said that Canadian businesses and the public want a way to express their frustration with the U.S. government, and the most straightforward way to do that is with their wallets. Tourism is already seeing an impact from the trade war – and not just because the Canadian dollar is set to take a hit. “You see people saying, I'm not going to travel to the U.S., I'll stay within Ontario or Canada or go somewhere else. You see it growing by Canadian sentiment. You see boycotts,” Tisch said. “And so, you know, while I'm optimistic that at some point there'll be some sort of deal that's done, in some ways, the damage has already been done, and the reputation, the impact on the reputation of American goods and services, that'll take years to repair.” Even with the contingencies being mapped out , though, decoupling from New York isn’t the most immediately attractive solution for many. and although there's a border extending from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain, for some, like Michel Beval, president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Canada’s Quebec chapter, cultures and communities supersede that. “We are neighbors, we are allies. We're partners. We have a history together. Canada was there when there was the 11th of September,” Beval said. “When all those planes stopped in Halifax and different airports, Canadian families received people that were on the plane and they couldn't go to the United States, received them at their house. We fought with each other during World War Two, recently in Afghanistan. So with all of that history, I don't understand why we put tariffs.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Lander nets 504 Democratic Club’s backing Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one News & Politics New York caught in middle of Trump’s trade war with Canada Trump’s tariffs are alienating a key trading partner and driving up energy prices.

Kathy Hochul has said that she’s willing to hold up the state budget for as long as it takes to get legislative leaders to agree to her policy proposals – but most City & State readers expect the budget to be wrapped up in the next couple weeks. More than 380 people entered City & State’s 2025 state budget poll, with guesses ranging from April 10 at the earliest to Aug. 8 at the latest. The poll was first made available on April 9, and two sunny-eyed optimists predicted that the budget would be finished the very next day – only to soon be disappointed. The most popular guess was April 30 (with 31 guesses), closely followed by April 25 and April 29 (with 28 guesses each) and April 24 and May 2 (with 22 guesses each). Most readers expect that the budget will be finalized in the last week of April. In fact, more than a third of all guesses were for somewhere between April 24 and April 30. Bizarrely, though, only two people guessed that the budget would be finished specifically on April 27. If budget negotiations drag into May, as City & State has reported they might, readers expect them to be wrapped up relatively quickly in the month. Of the 133 people who guessed that the budget would be finished some time in May, 51 guessed it would be finished between May 1 and May 3. Fortunately, few people seem to think we’re headed back to the bad old days of the Pataki administration, when budgets weren’t finished until the late summer. Only 11 people guessed that the budget would be finalized in June, July or August.

Lewis | April 16, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 16, 2025 News & Politics Campaigns & Elections Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda New York State Democrats still appear to be riding high on President Donald Trump’s decision to pull Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be United Nations ambassador, with Gov. Kathy Hochul telling party officials that she views Stefanik’s North Country seat as a prime pickup opportunity as Stefanik reportedly considers running for Hochul’s position. Hochul kicked off a closed-door virtual state Democratic Committee meeting Tuesday evening by celebrating Democrats’ successes in last year’s New York congressional races and looking towards the future. “I think we can win, not just the seats we won last year, hold on to all those, but also we're going to have some pickups,” Hochul said. There are a couple of seats that Democrats targeted in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island last year where they came up short that would make sense as renewed targets. Rep. Mike Lawler, who is openly considering a run for governor against Hochul, still represents a swing district that on paper should be favorable to Democrats. And headway made with victories in nearby districts could embolden Democrats to take on Rep. Nick Lalota again. But Hochul mentioned neither of those candidates, nor Staten Island’s Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, another perennial target for Democrats. Instead, she looked north. “If you're living in Elise Stefanik’s district and you're a Republican farmer where someone in a small community is not getting the tourism they used to get from Canada – tourism is such an important part of this state – we're going to win a seat up there,” the governor said. “I know we are, because people, Republicans, have had it with their own party ruining their lives.” A spokesperson for Hochul’s campaign told City & State that the governor sees all Republican-held congressional seats, including Stefanik’s, as potential pick-up opportunities. “The Governor has made it clear that every Republican seat in the state is in play for 2026,” Jen Goodman said. “New York House Republicans are failing their constituents by raising costs for working families, gutting health care, and putting Social Security on the chopping block. Every single one of them is vulnerable because of their reckless decisions in Washington, and voters across New York will hold them accountable in 2026.” Stefanik has represented the 21st Congressional District since 2015, handily winning reelection year after year. Although Democrats have represented the district in the past – Stefanik’s own predecessor was a Democrat – the seat has become increasingly Republican to the point that while she remains in the seat, it has not been viewed as competitive. Stefanik herself has also increased her profile and influence since first getting elected, serving as the fourth-most powerful House Republican between 2021 and 2025 as chair of the House Republican Conference. Last year, her national profile got even bigger thanks to her role in committee hearings on antisemitism on college campuses, where she grilled Ivy League presidents. She was also a prominent Trump surrogate. After winning the election, Trump nominated Stefanik to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but doing so would have left her seat empty for a short period of time and diminished Republicans’ narrow majority in the House. Matters became further complicated as Democrats in Albany quietly considered legislation that would have granted the governor more time before calling a special election to replace Stefanik, thus leaving the seat open for longer. A multi-candidate race was also becoming increasingly likely, with Republicans and the state Conservative Party likely to run different people and an expected independent campaign from business owner Anthony Constantino splitting the right-wing vote. Democrats, on the other hand, had coalesced around farmer Blake Gendebien, who could have benefited from the crowded race. Trump ultimately pulled Stefanik from consideration last month, blowing up the special election political calculus. Now, NBC News reports that Stefanik is considering running for governor next year, which would throw the campaign for her seat into chaos once again. After Hochul spoke, state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs praised upstate county leaders for choosing “a great candidate” – though he did not mention Gendebien by name. “They actually scared Donald Trump off from appointing Elise Stefanik to the position at the United Nations,” Jacobs said. “So the next up will be a general election, of course. And as I said, great candidate, great effort, and that's really the way our team needs to work together.” Stefanik’s team brushed off both Hochul’s and Jacobs’ comments. “Kathy Hochul is the least popular elected official in the North Country by a long shot, so her statements are totally dismissed by North Country voters,” said Alex DeGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik. “This happens every cycle like clockwork, and every cycle, Elise Stefanik mops the floor of every Democrat they’ve ever run against her, often by the largest margin in the Northeast, and Elise consistently put up more votes than any candidate in the history of the North Country.” Stefanik didn’t rule out the potential of running for governor while speaking with the Times Union last week. She has long been considered a strong choice if she ever chose that route, but the prospect has never been seriously considered. Stefanik spoke last night at the annual state GOP gala in Manhattan, where Politico New York reported that the 2026 governor’s race was a hot topic of conversation as rumors about Stefanik’s political future begin to pick up. Gendebien spokesperson Georgia Greenleaf welcomed the comments from the state’s leading Democrats, while taking aim at Stefanik. “After Trump was spooked into canceling the NY-21 special, it looks like Democrats and Republicans are finally in agreement about something: Blake Gendebien is the person to finally deliver real representation for the North Country while Stefanik seems too busy launching her bid for Governor,” Greenleaf said.

Jefferson | April 8, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 8, 2025 Budget Albany Agenda Policy New York State According to state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, state budget negotiations have hit a “pause” as policy debates gum up progress, even if they are at the “beginning of the end.” Gov. Kathy Hochul has indicated that her key priorities in the budget don’t have much room for daylight. Between discovery reform, involuntary commitment, a cellphone ban in schools and a mask ban, Hochul is willing to wait as long as it takes for a deal that meets her wishes, even as New York needs to answer pressing fiscal questions like funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s capital plan. She told reporters last week that “summers are nice here too,” referring to a prolonged negotiation in the statehouse. But Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie are essentially in a holding pattern until Hochul presents language they can bring to their members – leaving the state budget, now eight days late, at a standstill. “We want to get it done, but we want to do it the right way,” Stewart-Cousins told reporters Tuesday. “There's a lot of policy, as you know, being discussed, and actually, it seems that every day we have new policies being brought up. Like I say, nature abhors a vacuum. Apparently, budgets abhor vacuums as well.” Even now, new policy ideas are filtering in from the executive chamber. After Hochul and Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado’s very public split saw him leave the 2026 gubernatorial ticket, she put forth a proposal Monday to end the practice of gubernatorial and lieutenant governor candidates running in separate primaries. This is after she reintroduced a mask ban proposal, inspired by pro-Palestinian protests last year, in late March after it wasn’t in her formal budget proposal. “It does add to things that we have to talk about within this context of trying to close the budget,” Stewart-Cousins said. “And so as I said, it seems that the more it stays open, the more policies that emerge. And frankly, we are trying to close down the budget, and less policy would help.” Heastie has been adamant for years that he doesn’t want to see policy in the state budget. According to him, the cellphone ban in schools is a done deal , but discovery reform remains a stumbling block. This week, Hochul has enlisted district attorneys to help stump for her proposed changes to the law. Members of the Black, Hispanic, Puerto Rican and Asian Caucus have opposed the governor’s proposed changes to the law and suggested instead codifying a 2023 court decision , which they say would address prosecutors’ concerns about case dismissals without undoing the 2019 reforms to the law. Like Hochul, they are prepared to stay in Albany for as long as it takes to find a palatable solution – even if that means cancelling the Legislature’s planned two-week break to observe Passover. The job of negotiating the budget has been made even more difficult by the looming threat of federal cuts to the state budget. The state currently receives $91 billion from the federal government, and Stewart–Cousins reiterated on Tuesday that the state isn’t in a position to make up the difference if New York’s Republican delegation can’t persuade federal leadership to hold off on some of the more drastic cost-saving measures. “We as a state, cannot backfill these federal gaps,” she said. “We cannot. So there is no large amount of money that is going to backfill all of these cuts and all of the potential of the cuts. So we really need for our Congress members to do their job.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Lawmakers propose alternative to Hochul's discovery changes as budget negotiations drag on Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Budget State Senate leader: Budget negotiations on ‘pause’ Gov.

Lewis | April 3, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 3, 2025 Taxes Andrew Cuomo Policy Albany Agenda New York State The eye-popping $60 million that New York state spent related to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s various scandals, including his legal defense, has prompted lawmakers to introduce legislation meant to curb excessive tabs on the taxpayer dime. But the bill wouldn’t apply only to the former governor – or even just to elected officials. It would apply to all public workers, and that has led public sector unions representing state workers to approach it with caution. Sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly Member Grace Lee, the State Taxpayer Oversight and Protection Act, or STOP Act, would expand the authority of the state comptroller to evaluate how state workers utilize taxpayer dollars in lawsuits related to their state work. Generally, the state attorney general’s office will represent state employees and those subject to the Public Officers Law, but in cases where it can’t, New York state will reimburse them for the cost of private attorneys. The comptroller currently has limited ability to reject the reimbursements, but the STOP Act would enable the comptroller to cut off the money if they determine that spending has become unreasonable. The clear impetus for the proposed legislation was Cuomo. “The way that Andrew Cuomo used the system for defense is extraordinary and was probably not contemplated when the law was written,” Lee told City & State. The ex-governor has hired multiple law firms to represent him in sexual harassment lawsuits brought by three different women, racking up millions of dollars in attorney fees. State Attorney General Letitia James recused herself from representing Cuomo, since her office investigated the sexual harassment claims against him, which means that the state has been on the hook for the cost of all of his attorneys. Cuomo has denied all of the allegations against him. The STOP Act would allow the comptroller to determine whether the costs covered by the state are “proportional to the needs of the case and consistent with the manner and methods of defense employed in similar or representative cases.” Hiring multiple high-paid attorneys from different law firms would automatically be considered “unreasonable” unless the state employee can make a compelling case for it. “This is really to ensure that we're not writing blank checks to politicians to support their legal defense,” Lee said. “I believe that everyone is due their day in court, but they shouldn't do it at the full expense of taxpayers.” However, the legislation is already raising some eyebrows within public sector unions who represent state workers and civil servants. The Public Employees Federation – which covers scientific, professional and technical state workers – said it has concerns about the bill. “As a union, we are looking at the STOP Act closely,” Rob Merrill, a union spokesperson, told City & State in a statement. “We have concerns that this will negatively impact the defense options available to our members who are sued while acting as agents of the state.” The state’s largest municipal union, the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, has not taken a position on the bill yet, but a spokesperson said that the union is reviewing the “potential impact, if any, on the state workforce represented by CSEA and will continue to monitor its progress in the NYS legislature.” A spokesperson for United University Professions, which represents State University of New York faculty and staff, confirmed that the STOP Act would impact its members if enacted and that its attorneys are reviewing the proposal. And a public sector union source said that labor groups have different levels of concern about the potential impacts of the legislation. Lee said that she has already spoken with CSEA and that PEF was in the process of reviewing the bill. She said that she doesn’t have major concerns about pushback from unions. “I believe that this bill will continue to ensure that people do have adequate defense, but ensures that no one is exploiting taxpayer money while they do it,” she said. But Lee also said that she is willing to discuss potential amendments to address any specific concerns raised by unions.

Liz Krueger and Assembly Member Grace Lee, the State Taxpayer Oversight and Protection Act, or STOP Act, would expand the authority of the state comptroller to evaluate how state workers utilize taxpayer dollars in lawsuits related to their state work. Generally, the state attorney general’s office will represent state employees and those subject to the Public Officers Law, but in cases where it can’t, New York state will reimburse them for the cost of private attorneys. The comptroller currently has limited ability to reject the reimbursements, but the STOP Act would enable the comptroller to cut off the money if they determine that spending has become unreasonable. The clear impetus for the proposed legislation was Cuomo. “The way that Andrew Cuomo used the system for defense is extraordinary and was probably not contemplated when the law was written,” Lee told City & State. The ex-governor has hired multiple law firms to represent him in sexual harassment lawsuits brought by three different women, racking up millions of dollars in attorney fees. State Attorney General Letitia James recused herself from representing Cuomo, since her office investigated the sexual harassment claims against him, which means that the state has been on the hook for the cost of all of his attorneys. Cuomo has denied all of the allegations against him. The STOP Act would allow the comptroller to determine whether the costs covered by the state are “proportional to the needs of the case and consistent with the manner and methods of defense employed in similar or representative cases.” Hiring multiple high-paid attorneys from different law firms would automatically be considered “unreasonable” unless the state employee can make a compelling case for it. “This is really to ensure that we're not writing blank checks to politicians to support their legal defense,” Lee said. “I believe that everyone is due their day in court, but they shouldn't do it at the full expense of taxpayers.” However, the legislation is already raising some eyebrows within public sector unions who represent state workers and civil servants. The Public Employees Federation – which covers scientific, professional and technical state workers – said it has concerns about the bill. “As a union, we are looking at the STOP Act closely,” Rob Merrill, a union spokesperson, told City & State in a statement. “We have concerns that this will negatively impact the defense options available to our members who are sued while acting as agents of the state.” The state’s largest municipal union, the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, has not taken a position on the bill yet, but a spokesperson said that the union is reviewing the “potential impact, if any, on the state workforce represented by CSEA and will continue to monitor its progress in the NYS legislature.” A spokesperson for United University Professions, which represents State University of New York faculty and staff, confirmed that the STOP Act would impact its members if enacted and that its attorneys are reviewing the proposal. And a public sector union source said that labor groups have different levels of concern about the potential impacts of the legislation. Lee said that she has already spoken with CSEA and that PEF was in the process of reviewing the bill. She said that she doesn’t have major concerns about pushback from unions. “I believe that this bill will continue to ensure that people do have adequate defense, but ensures that no one is exploiting taxpayer money while they do it,” she said. But Lee also said that she is willing to discuss potential amendments to address any specific concerns raised by unions.

Lewis | April 24, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 Budget Housing Homelessness Policy Albany Agenda New York State State leaders are negotiating a potential deal to include a long-desired rental voucher bill in the state budget, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions. It’s the most serious that discussions about the measure have gotten since legislators and housing advocates started pushing for it in earnest several years ago. Talk of the Housing Access Voucher Program emerged as the state budget nears the one month mark in tardiness. Although the measure has widespread support from tenant advocates and real estate interests alike, Gov. Kathy Hochul has repeatedly declined to back the measure in the past over the price tag. Advocates have called for a minimum of $250 million to fund the program that would provide rental vouchers to people at imminent risk of eviction and those currently experiencing homelessness. They estimate the total cost of the program to hit about $1 billion, while the governor’s office has asserted it would cost the state as much as $6 billion to implement. Both the state Senate and Assembly have included the voucher program and $250 million of funding in their one-house budget proposals for several years. Without support from the governor, though, the measure has fallen off the table time and again. Now, multiple sources with knowledge of negotiations say that Hochul has expressed a new openness to discussing the program and the potential for finding a compromise to include it in the late spending plan. One source suggested that while the governor’s office may not be offering a “warm” reception, the fact that they opened the door at all is a big step forward compared to years past. Although legislative leaders are discussing the prospect of a deal, details on what exactly that would look like remain murky. The biggest question that remains unanswered is exactly how much money the state would dedicate to the program in the case of a compromise. None of the sources briefed on discussions could even provide a ballpark estimate of what the governor may counter with, if not the full $250 million that advocates and lawmakers have pushed for. The Housing Access Voucher Program has continued to rack up support from a variety of interests, even those that often find themselves on opposing sides on other housing matters. Both Housing Committee chairs in the Legislature recently published a joint op-ed with Real Estate Board of New York President James Whelan and WIN CEO Christine Quinn in support of the measure. Several high profile unions – including 32BJ, the United Federation of Teachers and DC37 – also sent a new letter to Hochul on Thursday offering their support for the program as well, marking the first time that labor has offered public, unified advocacy for the bill. – With reporting by Austin C.

Lewis | April 15, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 15, 2025 Budget Criminal Justice Albany Agenda Policy New York State Discovery Reform The state budget, now over two weeks late, may be slightly closer to completion now that Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has announced a “framework” of a deal on the issue of discovery. “I just briefed my conference, and we’re in a good place,” Heastie told reporters on Tuesday, additionally thanking New York City’s five district attorneys, whom he had been discussing the matter with. The non-fiscal issue has been a major priority for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has said she would not sign a budget without changes to the law that governs evidence-sharing and has been holding up the budget until coming to an agreement. Details of the conceptual deal, which still needs a thumbs-up from the governor, remain murky. But Heastie said the compromise would allow judges to consider prejudice when it comes to missing evidence – a matter that had emerged as a key sticking point between prosecutors and public defenders. District attorneys around the state, who have played an outsized role in the negotiations, have made it clear that they won’t budge unless judges can consider whether a missing piece of evidence would unfairly prejudice the defense before deciding whether to dismiss a case. Criminal justice reform advocates, meanwhile, have viewed that question of prejudice as a hard line in the sand. Hochul was in Manhattan on Monday, once again making the case for her proposed changes to the discovery law, which would roll back parts of the 2019 reforms that were meant to even the playing field between prosecutors and defendants. She has been insistent that the changes are necessary to prevent the dismissal of cases on mere “technicalities,” which she says is unfair to survivors of domestic violence. “Three months ago, I stood up before our state, and I made a vow, and that was to fight for victims of domestic and gender-based violence,” Hochul said, referencing the introduction of her executive budget proposal in January. “A vow to fix loopholes that denies them justice and very often puts their lives in danger.” Hochul has had district attorneys advocating for the changes as surrogates several times in the past week, and she herself has now held three different press conferences to push for the changes. At Monday’s event in Manhattan, she hammered home statistics that show that 94% of domestic violence cases were dismissed in 2023 in New York City. According to her office, that’s up from 70% of cases in 2019 before the reforms took effect. The governor’s proposed changes to discovery, meant to narrow the pool of evidence prosecutors must turn over to the defense and to make it harder for judges to dismiss cases over discovery mistakes, have rankled public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates. The defenders have argued that the governor’s “tweaks,” which are strongly supported by the state’s district attorneys, would effectively amount to a wholesale repeal of the 2019 reforms and once again allow prosecutors to withhold crucial evidence until the eve of a trial. The debate over the discovery law is highly technical and hinges heavily on the specific language used in the law. The governor released proposed language in her executive budget proposal back in January, and state Sen. Cordell Cleare released her own alternative proposal earlier this month. One of the key issues in dispute is the matter of prejudice, or the degree to which a piece of evidence directly impacts the defendant’s case. The Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, ruled in the case People v. Bay that a judge must consider a prosecutor’s good faith and due diligence when making a decision about missing evidence. If a court finds that evidence was not turned over before the speedy trial deadline elapsed, but that the prosecutor exercised good faith and due diligence in seeking to turn over evidence, then they cannot dismiss the case. But in cases where the court finds that prosecutors did not exercise due diligence and a missing piece of evidence was only found after the speedy trial clock has run out, then they must dismiss the case. “There is no rule of ‘strict liability’; that is, the statute does not require or anticipate a ‘perfect prosecutor,’” Judge Caitlin Halligan wrote in the Bay decision. “On the other hand, the plain terms of the statute make clear that while good faith is required, it is not sufficient standing alone and cannot cure a lack of diligence.” The decision goes on to cite the factors that judges should consider when assessing whether or not prosecutors demonstrated due diligence. “Although the relevant factors for assessing due diligence may vary from case to case, courts should generally consider, among other things, the efforts made by the prosecution and the prosecutor's office to comply with the statutory requirements, the volume of discovery provided and outstanding, the complexity of the case, how obvious any missing material would likely have been to a prosecutor exercising due diligence, the explanation for any discovery lapse, and the People's response when apprised of any missing discovery,” Halligan wrote. Prosecutors argue that it is not enough for judges to consider only good faith and due diligence. They also want judges to consider prejudice. They argue that even if a prosecutor mistakenly does not act with due diligence in looking for evidence and turning it over to the defense, a case still shouldn’t be dismissed if the missing evidence is trivial. “The point really is that nothing should be dismissed if it was inadvertent, if there's no prejudice to the defendant and whether or not it's looked at as a whole to be fair,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in Albany last week. “And that's really the language that the governor is proposing, which is that the judges look at the entire discovery as a whole, not just one document.” Several legislators, as well as criminal justice reform advocates, have supported codification of the Bay decision. But district attorneys say that would not be sufficient. “It doesn’t factor in prejudice,” Westchester District Attorney Susan Cacace said of the Bay decision. “If something that's not turned over to by happenstance, despite the people's due diligence, is not relevant to the case, there shouldn't be a dismissal, unless prejudice,” Cacace said. However, under current law and the Bay decision, Cacace’s hypothetical would not lead to dismissal if prosecutors show they exercised due diligence. It’s a big reason why criminal justice reform advocates support the Bay standard. Eli Northrup, a public defender and policy advocate at the Bronx Defenders, called it “pretty damning” if prosecutors are saying that due diligence is too high a standard to hold them to. According to public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates, permitting the consideration of prejudice would remove the incentive for district attorneys to hand over evidence in a timely manner. “During the ‘blindfold era,’ the court was unable to enforce prompt discovery disclosure because it could not impose a consequence unless the defense demonstrated that late disclosure caused prejudice that couldn’t be cured with more time to review the material,” a fact sheet from the group Protect Kalief’s Law reads. In other words, the advocates argue that if prejudice is explicitly considered again without any other guardrails, the risk of dismissal would all but disappear in favor of delays to the trial, often to the detriment of the accused. It sounded like there might be room for compromise, even on the issue of prejudice. But as of Tuesday afternoon, the specifics on what legislators may be agreeing to remain murky – particularly whether or not prejudicial evidence would lead to automatic dismissal after the speedy trial clock runs out or whether a judge could impose other cures like delays instead of dismissal. And the difference between the two is a major one for defense attorneys and prosecutors alike. – With reporting from Austin C.

Kathy Hochul has said that she’s willing to hold up the state budget for as long as it takes to get legislative leaders to agree to her policy proposals – but most City & State readers expect the budget to be wrapped up in the next couple weeks. More than 380 people entered City & State’s 2025 state budget poll, with guesses ranging from April 10 at the earliest to Aug. 8 at the latest. The poll was first made available on April 9, and two sunny-eyed optimists predicted that the budget would be finished the very next day – only to soon be disappointed. The most popular guess was April 30 (with 31 guesses), closely followed by April 25 and April 29 (with 28 guesses each) and April 24 and May 2 (with 22 guesses each). Most readers expect that the budget will be finalized in the last week of April. In fact, more than a third of all guesses were for somewhere between April 24 and April 30. Bizarrely, though, only two people guessed that the budget would be finished specifically on April 27. If budget negotiations drag into May, as City & State has reported they might, readers expect them to be wrapped up relatively quickly in the month. Of the 133 people who guessed that the budget would be finished some time in May, 51 guessed it would be finished between May 1 and May 3. Fortunately, few people seem to think we’re headed back to the bad old days of the Pataki administration, when budgets weren’t finished until the late summer. Only 11 people guessed that the budget would be finalized in June, July or August.

Jefferson | April 18, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 18, 2025 Cannabis Policy Taxes Albany Agenda New York State The state Office of Cannabis Management has taken some lumps for its rollout of the legal cannabis market, raising concerns about its support for dispensaries and ability to enforce regulations in New York. But four years after the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act’s passage, one small town figured out a way to make the adult-use market work for them. Henrietta, a Rochester-area town with two cannabis dispensaries, generated about $750,000 in cannabis tax revenue in 2024 and is putting it back into the community. While decriminalization efforts and access to legal pot often take the forefront in discussions of the MRTA, the law also promised substantial local tax revenue – and New Yorkers are now beginning to see that promise realized. Henrietta Town Supervisor Stephen Schultz used the funds to hire an additional Monroe County sheriff’s deputy to help control speeding in residential areas and also plans to roll back property taxes for Henrietta residents next year. “The revenues from the cannabis tax far exceeded our expectations,” Schultz told City & State. “So now, not only can we fully fund the position, but we can now start to offset some costs that would normally be borne by our residents through property taxes. In fact, due to the high inflation, we had to increase the property tax levy last year. It was not a big increase, but it was our first increase in seven years that wasn’t tied to a ballot referendum, one to build the library and one to build the spray park, albeit six years apart. Had we known the amount of revenue we were to receive from cannabis, we could have eliminated that increase.” Other municipalities in New York that opted into the MRTA, like Kingston, have also discussed how to use cannabis funds once the revenue finally comes in. Over the past few years, issues with cannabis licensing meant that amassing the sort of tax receipts that Henrietta did was more of a pipe dream than reality. But towns like Henrietta, with its two adult-use dispensaries and more on the way, are now figuring out ways to address affordability and public safety concerns with cannabis tax dollars, in ways unthinkable just a decade ago. Schultz streamlined the process for dispensary owners like Martin to do business, and the town is reaping the benefits, even though the town did not opt in to allowing on-site consumption centers, coincidentally, because it could make the roads less safe. He even kept the location of MJ Dispensary and RISE, the town's two dispensaries, in mind. “We decided that, rather than stick these companies in an 'adult use zone' way off the beaten path, we chose a subset of our commercial district where there were no churches, parks, playgrounds or residences, and said they could set up shop there,” Schultzs said. ”I think that good retail visibility is why we have had a lot of shoppers in Henrietta as well as why the shops are doing well, since they are easy to get to and in a safe and well-traveled area.” Ryan Martin, the owner of MJ Dispensary, said that after the rough rollout of the legal market, it’s been heartening to see that the success of his store is having a positive knock-on effect on the community. Martin added his dispensary averages 15,000 customers per month and from the profit generated, 3% goes to the town and 1% to Monroe County. “I couldn't be more proud and blessed to be able to help out and help people see maybe no taxes raised, or even a possible reduction in taxes in the future,” he said. Given the history of the criminalization of marijuana, there’s some irony in the fact that cannabis tax revenue is now funding law enforcement positions, but the benefits for towns like Henrietta are undeniable and could be replicated across the state. “It's almost mind-boggling to me to come from the bottom, and now we're at the top,” Martin said. “We're just very, very thankful to be a part of this cannabis industry and promote the power of this plant, which has had this huge stigma on it for 70 years.” Share This: NEXT STORY: The discovery debate is almost done.

Schultz streamlined the process for dispensary owners like Martin to do business, and the town is reaping the benefits, even though the town did not opt in to allowing on-site consumption centers, coincidentally, because it could make the roads less safe. He even kept the location of MJ Dispensary and RISE, the town's two dispensaries, in mind. “We decided that, rather than stick these companies in an 'adult use zone' way off the beaten path, we chose a subset of our commercial district where there were no churches, parks, playgrounds or residences, and said they could set up shop there,” Schultzs said. ”I think that good retail visibility is why we have had a lot of shoppers in Henrietta as well as why the shops are doing well, since they are easy to get to and in a safe and well-traveled area.” Ryan Martin, the owner of MJ Dispensary, said that after the rough rollout of the legal market, it’s been heartening to see that the success of his store is having a positive knock-on effect on the community. Martin added his dispensary averages 15,000 customers per month and from the profit generated, 3% goes to the town and 1% to Monroe County. “I couldn't be more proud and blessed to be able to help out and help people see maybe no taxes raised, or even a possible reduction in taxes in the future,” he said. Given the history of the criminalization of marijuana, there’s some irony in the fact that cannabis tax revenue is now funding law enforcement positions, but the benefits for towns like Henrietta are undeniable and could be replicated across the state. “It's almost mind-boggling to me to come from the bottom, and now we're at the top,” Martin said. “We're just very, very thankful to be a part of this cannabis industry and promote the power of this plant, which has had this huge stigma on it for 70 years.” Share This:     NEXT STORY: The discovery debate is almost done.

Kathy Hochul’s proposal to expand the eligibility of those eligible for early release from state prisons has prompted criticism from more conservative state lawmakers, but the state prison system proposed an even more sweeping expansion of eligibility for early release last year, City & State has learned. Currently, people who have been convicted of violent felony offenses are not eligible for the “merit time” program, which allows incarcerated people to earn time off of their sentence if they complete certain programs in prison. Since most people in state prison have been convicted of violent crimes, this means that only about 20% of incarcerated people are eligible for the “merit time” program. A “program bill” from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision that was shared with criminal justice reform advocates and lawmakers last year would have dramatically expanded eligibility to include all incarcerated people except for those convicted of sex offenses or Class A felonies (the most serious type of felony). A memo accompanying the program bill lays out why DOCCS believes that the expansion of merit time is necessary. “Expanding the pool of incarcerated individuals eligible for Merit Time will have several benefits: (1) encourage positive institutional adjustment; (2) increase the number of incarcerated individuals in treatment and work programs; (3) reduce idleness among the population; (4) lower violence in DOCCS facilities; and (5) enhance reentry opportunities,” the memo reads. “Sentence reduction is one of, if not the strongest incentive for good behavior and engagement in programs. These programs will not have their intended effect if 80% of the population are not able to access these incentives.” A spokesperson for DOCCS confirmed that the agency had released the program bill last year and stood by its recommendations to expand eligibility for merit time programs. “Governor Hochul has been clear that she will not allow anyone who demonstrates a public safety threat to be released early from prison,” Thomas Mailey, the spokesperson, said in an email. “While we cannot comment on pending legislation or ongoing budget negotiations, the Commissioner supports positive incentives that drive program participation and the reduction of violence within the facilities and ultimately our communities.” As part of this year’s budget negotiations, Hochul has proposed a more modest expansion of merit time eligibility. While the DOCCS proposal would only exclude people convicted of Class A felonies or sex offenses, the governor’s proposal would exclude people convicted of many more offenses, according to someone briefed on the proposal. Even the governor’s pared-back version of the DOCCS proposal has been controversial, though, with moderate Democratic lawmakers telling the New York Post that they do not believe incarcerated people convicted of violent crimes should be able to participate in programs that would allow them to earn an early release. Jess D’Amelia, a spokesperson for the governor, told City & State that Hochul’s proposal would only apply to a small number of incarcerated people. “Governor Hochul will not allow anyone who demonstrates a public safety threat to be released early from prison,” she said. “A proposal was discussed that would have granted near term merit time release to approximately 3% of the prison population – only if they have excellent disciplinary records and a plan to live a crime-free life outside DOCCS facilities. Under no circumstances will this Administration grant any special privileges to individuals convicted of murder, rape or other sex offenses.” Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers are backing the Earned Time Act , which would make all incarcerated people eligible for merit time programs no matter what they have been convicted of. The Earned Time Act, which is sponsored by state Sen. Jeremy Cooney and Assembly Member Anna Kelles, would also increase the amount of time that people can earn off their sentences by participating in programs. Currently, people eligible for merit time programs who are serving a prison sentence of a specific number of years can earn up to 1/7 off of their total sentence by participating in programs. That means that if they were serving a sentence of seven years, they could earn up to one year off. The Earned Time Act would allow people to earn up to 1/4 off their total sentences by participating in merit time programs. This article has been updated with comments from DOCCS and the governor’s office.

Lewis | April 3, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 3, 2025 Education Budget Policy Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul racked up her first budget win on Thursday after Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie told reporters that her bell-to-bell school cellphone ban was the first piece of policy mostly settled in the spending plan. But the budget is already three days late, and Hochul indicated she’s willing to go even later as she defended her fourth consecutive missed budget deadline. Much of the budget remains in a state of limbo as lawmakers go home for the weekend after approving a second budget extender, which will last through Monday. But Heastie said that, at the very least, the first of Hochul’s four top policy priorities is settled. “I would say cellphones is just about done,” Heastie told reporters Thursday afternoon, adding that he and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins had agreed to the governor’s original proposal “with some tweaks.” A source familiar with the state of negotiations also confirmed that the governor had reached an agreement with legislative leaders on the cellphone ban, one of her marquee policy items for the year. Hochul spokesperson Sam Spokony did not directly address the idea that the issue was settled, but reiterated her commitment to the proposal. “Governor Hochul has championed bell-to-bell policies to create distraction-free schools across New York, and looks forward to working with the Legislature to finalise a budget that meets the needs of all New Yorkers,” Spokony said in a statement. Heastie’s comments were the most concrete update to the state of budget negotiations that any of the three top state leaders have offered in the last few weeks, and certainly since missing the April 1 deadline. Talks have largely stalled as Hochul has dug in on her policy priorities. Aside from the phone ban, the governor is seeking to change the discovery laws that govern when prosecutors must share evidence with defense attorneys, to strengthen the state’s involuntary commitment laws and to enact some version of a mask ban . The discovery debate has sucked much of the oxygen from the negotiating room, and progress on it would greatly propel budget discussions forward. Using the solar system as a metaphor, Heastie said that the Legislature is currently on Neptune – the planet furthest from Earth – in terms of how close a budget deal is. “But I believe if we can resolve discovery… we can be on Mars,” he said. Hochul was much more tight-lipped when she spoke to reporters on Thursday, the first time she has taken questions from the Albany press corps in nearly two weeks. “I’m not going to tell you,” Hochul said when asked about the status of various budget items, “because that’s not how you negotiate.” The governor has often said that she will not negotiate in public, leaving the status of the budget incredibly opaque until she finally announces a deal. But the governor said she is “truly not in any rush” to get the spending plan passed, even though it is already several days late. Since taking office in 2021, Hochul has never had an on-time budget, with the budget being passed as late as May in 2023. On Thursday, the governor wouldn’t even give a rough estimate of when officials might finish this year. “I know that some of the legislators may be anxious to hit certain vacation plans, but I'm not going anywhere,” Hochul said. “I don't make vacations, so I'll be here to see this through.” The fiscal year begins in New York on April 1, giving the governor and lawmakers a statutory deadline to approve a spending plan. But Hochul seems content to treat that deadline more as a suggestion than a requirement, if it means she can get her preferred policy items into the budget. “If I was hung up on the deadline, we would not have the budget that I believe in my heart is the best budget for the people of New York,” she said. Delaying the budget has succeeded in delivering several policy wins in the past few years, including rollbacks to the landmark 2019 reforms to the state’s bail laws and the passage of a major housing package. “April 1 is a great date,” Hochul said. “I'd love to hit it, but I am very successful in overtime.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Bill to limit taxpayer funding of Cuomo’s legal fees worries public sector unions Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Education State leaders agree to school cellphone ban as rest of budget remains in limbo Legislative leaders and Gov.

Lewis | April 25, 2025 02:32 PM ET By Rebecca C. Lewis April 25, 2025 02:32 PM ET Budget Policy Albany Agenda New York State With all the talk of nonfiscal policy items in the state budget so far, one might forget that it is, in fact, a financial plan first and foremost. State leaders seem close to wrapping up the thorniest issues, including changes to the discovery law and involuntary commitment, which means that they can finally get to the billions of dollars on the table for the budget. With looming uncertainty about federal cuts and a potential recession on the horizon, the state’s finances are not a sure thing. But don’t worry, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has repeatedly assured reporters that the money part of the budget could get done in a snap. Gov. Kathy Hochul in January proposed a record $252 billion budget. The final spending plan will likely be even larger, even if only by a little, as the Legislature generally pushes for more spending than the governor – the state Senate proposed a $259 billion plan and the Assembly a $256.5 billion one. Of that money, roughly $91 billion is expected to come from the federal government. It seems increasingly likely that New York and other states should expect deep cuts to that funding stream – but without any specifics yet, leaders are content to take a wait-and-see approach to how to deal with it. On the executive side, both Hochul and her budget director Blake Washington have said that nothing the state does will be able to backfill federal cuts to crucial services. In New York, Medicaid stands to suffer the most, as that’s where most of the federal dollars go towards. “The only way you can really backfill on the state side is to cut services for other things, and you sort of modify spending across the platform,” Washington told reporters on April 1 , the day the budget was technically due. Legislative leaders have made similar statements. “There is no large amount of money that is going to backfill all of these cuts and all of the potential of the cuts,” state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said earlier this month. “So we really need for our Congress members to do their job.” Heastie has said that he won’t address the potential of federal cuts until they actually materialize – meaning that a special session later in the year to deal with those may be in the cards. “Since we've gotten nothing direct from the feds or the Republicans as to what they would cut, I don't know why I would do a budget that anticipates cuts that – I don't even know if the Republicans can do this,” Heastie said late last month. Even as the governor and legislative leaders continue their wait-and-see approach to both the recession and federal cuts, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli has released reports in the past month that included warnings about the state’s precarious financial future. In his March State Cash Report, DiNapoli said that the state had collected more taxes in the previous fiscal year than predicted in the governor’s January budget proposal. But he warned that economic growth may not last. “Policy decisions at the federal level, such as tariffs and federal aid cuts, are currently causing economic uncertainty,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “While the actual impact of these policies is unknown, the heightened risks they pose should be considered as the enacted budget for SFY 2025-26 is finalized.” The comptroller released another report this week that found that the state still receives slightly more money from the federal government than it receives, thanks to the last of the pandemic aid, but he said that is set to change, too. “Actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congress may cut health care, food assistance, infrastructure and other critical programs to the detriment of all New Yorkers,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “Major cuts in federal funding simply cannot be replaced by state taxpayers, will reduce the services the state provides and will exacerbate the long-standing history of New Yorkers sending more of their hard-earned tax dollars to the federal government than they get back.” Of course, some cuts have already materialized, with the state losing out on over $300 million for health and addiction services that had already been appropriated. New York and other states are fighting the cut in courts. According to the left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, the state has lost a total of at least $900 million already from federal cuts. The think tank earlier this week advised that leaders should proceed with caution when it comes to the state’s finances. “Many have criticized the late budget, but with an incredibly uncertain economic outlook and significant risks to federal funding, state policymakers have every reason to make slow and careful decisions,” Fiscal Policy Institute Director Nathan Gusdorf said in a statement. The group recommended increasing taxes on high earners in anticipation of federal cuts and opposed Hochul’s proposal to send out “inflation rebate” checks to most New Yorkers, arguing that there were better uses for a $3 billion tax surplus. Proceeding with caution is something that both sides of the ideological aisle can agree on, even if different groups disagree on the best path forward. The fiscally conservative Citizens Budget Commission similarly advised lawmakers to reject the governor’s proposed “inflation rebate” checks and to plan for federal cuts and a turbulent fiscal outlook. “The budget should set aside at least $2 billion to mitigate potential federal cuts and not spread $3 billion so thinly among taxpayers that it won’t help affordability,” Citizens Budget Commission President Andrew Rein said in a statement the day on April 1. In an op-ed from this week , the group’s director of state policies Patrick Orecki dinged leaders for allowing nonfiscal issues to take up all the air in the negotiating room. “The critical budget issues are how the State will prepare for potentially massive federal cuts and a possible recession, stabilize its precarious fiscal house of cards, raise and spend over $252 billion of taxpayer money, and improve New York’s affordability,” he wrote. But this is the easy stuff, apparently. “Like I said, we could probably knock out numbers in just a matter of hours,” Heastie told reporters last month.

Lewis By Rebecca C. Lewis Rebecca C. Lewis | April 25, 2025 02:32 PM ET By     Budget Budget Budget Budget Policy Policy Policy Policy Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda New York State New York State New York State New York State With all the talk of nonfiscal policy items in the state budget so far, one might forget that it is, in fact, a financial plan first and foremost. State leaders seem close to wrapping up the thorniest issues, including changes to the discovery law and involuntary commitment, which means that they can finally get to the billions of dollars on the table for the budget. With looming uncertainty about federal cuts and a potential recession on the horizon, the state’s finances are not a sure thing. But don’t worry, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has repeatedly assured reporters that the money part of the budget could get done in a snap. Gov. Kathy Hochul in January proposed a record $252 billion budget. The final spending plan will likely be even larger, even if only by a little, as the Legislature generally pushes for more spending than the governor – the state Senate proposed a $259 billion plan and the Assembly a $256.5 billion one. Of that money, roughly $91 billion is expected to come from the federal government. It seems increasingly likely that New York and other states should expect deep cuts to that funding stream – but without any specifics yet, leaders are content to take a wait-and-see approach to how to deal with it. On the executive side, both Hochul and her budget director Blake Washington have said that nothing the state does will be able to backfill federal cuts to crucial services. In New York, Medicaid stands to suffer the most, as that’s where most of the federal dollars go towards. “The only way you can really backfill on the state side is to cut services for other things, and you sort of modify spending across the platform,” Washington told reporters on April 1 , the day the budget was technically due. Legislative leaders have made similar statements. “There is no large amount of money that is going to backfill all of these cuts and all of the potential of the cuts,” state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said earlier this month. “So we really need for our Congress members to do their job.” Heastie has said that he won’t address the potential of federal cuts until they actually materialize – meaning that a special session later in the year to deal with those may be in the cards. “Since we've gotten nothing direct from the feds or the Republicans as to what they would cut, I don't know why I would do a budget that anticipates cuts that – I don't even know if the Republicans can do this,” Heastie said late last month. Even as the governor and legislative leaders continue their wait-and-see approach to both the recession and federal cuts, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli has released reports in the past month that included warnings about the state’s precarious financial future. In his March State Cash Report, DiNapoli said that the state had collected more taxes in the previous fiscal year than predicted in the governor’s January budget proposal. But he warned that economic growth may not last. “Policy decisions at the federal level, such as tariffs and federal aid cuts, are currently causing economic uncertainty,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “While the actual impact of these policies is unknown, the heightened risks they pose should be considered as the enacted budget for SFY 2025-26 is finalized.” The comptroller released another report this week that found that the state still receives slightly more money from the federal government than it receives, thanks to the last of the pandemic aid, but he said that is set to change, too. “Actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congress may cut health care, food assistance, infrastructure and other critical programs to the detriment of all New Yorkers,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “Major cuts in federal funding simply cannot be replaced by state taxpayers, will reduce the services the state provides and will exacerbate the long-standing history of New Yorkers sending more of their hard-earned tax dollars to the federal government than they get back.” Of course, some cuts have already materialized, with the state losing out on over $300 million for health and addiction services that had already been appropriated. New York and other states are fighting the cut in courts. According to the left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, the state has lost a total of at least $900 million already from federal cuts. The think tank earlier this week advised that leaders should proceed with caution when it comes to the state’s finances. “Many have criticized the late budget, but with an incredibly uncertain economic outlook and significant risks to federal funding, state policymakers have every reason to make slow and careful decisions,” Fiscal Policy Institute Director Nathan Gusdorf said in a statement. The group recommended increasing taxes on high earners in anticipation of federal cuts and opposed Hochul’s proposal to send out “inflation rebate” checks to most New Yorkers, arguing that there were better uses for a $3 billion tax surplus.

Lewis | April 7, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 7, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State Discovery Reform Members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus rallied against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed changes to the state’s discovery laws on Monday, while two New York City district attorneys made a case in support of the measure. The prosecutors expressed an openness to compromise, and lawmakers said they’d support certain language to tweak the law to codify a court decision clarifying the statute. But a final deal on the issue, which has in part held up the state budget for over a week, still remains elusive. As part of her executive budget proposal in January, Hochul included changes to the state laws that govern how and when prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense. Her proposed language would modify the current law in a number of ways, namely by shifting from requiring prosecutors to provide the defense with all “related” to requiring all “relevant” evidence be turned over, and permitting consequences less severe than dismissal should minor or inadvertent discovery errors come to light after the speedy trial clock has run out. Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg spoke to reporters in Albany about the need for changes, reiterating their support for the intent of the initial 2019 reforms to make the discovery process more fair to defendants, while arguing that the reforms have had the unintended consequence of cases getting dismissed on technicalities or minor infractions. “We've been working really, really hard to come to a compromise in order to make some smart changes or tweaks to the law, so that we can avoid dismissals on technicalities,” Clark said. She added that the proposed changes are meant to “level the playing field for victims.” A number of victims rights groups have highlighted instances in which domestic or sexual violence cases were dismissed due to a minor mistakes related to discovery. Although current law provides a variety of remedies for such mistakes other than dismissal, violating the speedy trial law results in automatic dismissal. That means that judges have often felt constrained to dismiss cases if issues with discovery, even small ones, occur after the speedy trial clock has already run out or after a prosecutor has filed a certificate of compliance to stop the clock, according to the district attorneys. Clark said that “everything is still on the table” when it comes to negotiating a compromise in order to get the budget passed, adding that legislative leaders have made counterproposals to the governor. Clark did not provide any specific details on what those counterproposals look like, but suggested that prosecutors have “compromised on things already.” Shortly after Bragg and Clark spoke to reporters, members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus offered a counter-narrative, expressing strong opposition to the governor’s proposal and suggesting that they’d be willing to stay in Albany as long as it takes to prevent it from being approved. “We can fix the dismissal problems without dismantling justice,” said Assembly Member Michaelle Solages, chair of the caucus. “And we can protect all victims by making sure there's truth in every courthouse.” She and other lawmakers at the rally argued that the governor’s proposal would constitute an effective wholesale reversal of the 2019 reforms. Instead, Solages and others in the caucus said that they would support language that codifies a 2023 Court of Appeals decision in the case of People v. Bay . That ruling clarified in case law that a judge can impose less severe remedies for discovery mistakes even after a certificate of compliance has been filed and stopped the speedy trial clock, as long as prosecutors can prove that they acted in good faith and with due diligence. “Codifying the decision is what we need to do, not destroy the law,” Solages said, echoing an argument that New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams made last week . But lawmakers could not offer any specific details on what language would look like to codify that court decision or how it would differ from what the governor has already proposed. “Our leadership has our desires, and we're working with them – on both sides, in both chambers – to come up with language,” Solages said. “But at the end of the day, we have a court case that is a guiding light for this process.” Legislators also signaled that, like the governor, they’re willing to stay as long as they need to ensure that discovery is done right. “Summers are beautiful in Albany,” said Assembly Member Gabriella Romero, who represents the state capital – repeating the same line Hochul used last week when asked about how late the budget may go.

Lewis By Rebecca C. Lewis Rebecca C. Lewis | April 7, 2025 By     Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Budget Budget Budget Budget Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Policy Policy Policy Policy New York State New York State New York State New York State Discovery Reform Discovery Reform Discovery Reform Discovery Reform Members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus rallied against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed changes to the state’s discovery laws on Monday, while two New York City district attorneys made a case in support of the measure. The prosecutors expressed an openness to compromise, and lawmakers said they’d support certain language to tweak the law to codify a court decision clarifying the statute. But a final deal on the issue, which has in part held up the state budget for over a week, still remains elusive. As part of her executive budget proposal in January, Hochul included changes to the state laws that govern how and when prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense. Her proposed language would modify the current law in a number of ways, namely by shifting from requiring prosecutors to provide the defense with all “related” to requiring all “relevant” evidence be turned over, and permitting consequences less severe than dismissal should minor or inadvertent discovery errors come to light after the speedy trial clock has run out. Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg spoke to reporters in Albany about the need for changes, reiterating their support for the intent of the initial 2019 reforms to make the discovery process more fair to defendants, while arguing that the reforms have had the unintended consequence of cases getting dismissed on technicalities or minor infractions. “We've been working really, really hard to come to a compromise in order to make some smart changes or tweaks to the law, so that we can avoid dismissals on technicalities,” Clark said. She added that the proposed changes are meant to “level the playing field for victims.” A number of victims rights groups have highlighted instances in which domestic or sexual violence cases were dismissed due to a minor mistakes related to discovery. Although current law provides a variety of remedies for such mistakes other than dismissal, violating the speedy trial law results in automatic dismissal. That means that judges have often felt constrained to dismiss cases if issues with discovery, even small ones, occur after the speedy trial clock has already run out or after a prosecutor has filed a certificate of compliance to stop the clock, according to the district attorneys. Clark said that “everything is still on the table” when it comes to negotiating a compromise in order to get the budget passed, adding that legislative leaders have made counterproposals to the governor. Clark did not provide any specific details on what those counterproposals look like, but suggested that prosecutors have “compromised on things already.” Shortly after Bragg and Clark spoke to reporters, members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus offered a counter-narrative, expressing strong opposition to the governor’s proposal and suggesting that they’d be willing to stay in Albany as long as it takes to prevent it from being approved. “We can fix the dismissal problems without dismantling justice,” said Assembly Member Michaelle Solages, chair of the caucus. “And we can protect all victims by making sure there's truth in every courthouse.” She and other lawmakers at the rally argued that the governor’s proposal would constitute an effective wholesale reversal of the 2019 reforms. Instead, Solages and others in the caucus said that they would support language that codifies a 2023 Court of Appeals decision in the case of People v. Bay . That ruling clarified in case law that a judge can impose less severe remedies for discovery mistakes even after a certificate of compliance has been filed and stopped the speedy trial clock, as long as prosecutors can prove that they acted in good faith and with due diligence. “Codifying the decision is what we need to do, not destroy the law,” Solages said, echoing an argument that New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams made last week . But lawmakers could not offer any specific details on what language would look like to codify that court decision or how it would differ from what the governor has already proposed. “Our leadership has our desires, and we're working with them – on both sides, in both chambers – to come up with language,” Solages said. “But at the end of the day, we have a court case that is a guiding light for this process.” Legislators also signaled that, like the governor, they’re willing to stay as long as they need to ensure that discovery is done right. “Summers are beautiful in Albany,” said Assembly Member Gabriella Romero, who represents the state capital – repeating the same line Hochul used last week when asked about how late the budget may go.

In response to any verifiable right of access or portability request, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form, so that you can transfer it to another party, if you have given us permission to process your Personal Data and when the processing was done automatically. You may exercise your Right to Appeal or designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf by calling us toll free at 1-866-I-OPT-OUT (1-866-467-8688) and enter service code 745. Users in the EU/EEA/Switzerland and UK Data Subject Rights If you are a user in the EU, EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you may have the following data protection rights: Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you where we are the data controller and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us. Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be explained to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Data, which override your rights and freedoms. Request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to temporarily stop  the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you have concerns about the accuracy of your information and want to have it rectified; (b) where you believe our use of your information may be  unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information for the purposes of defending or exercising your rights with respect to a legal claim even though we may no longer need it; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to keep it. Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in your Member State. To submit a request, please Email privacy@govexec.com and be sure to include “GDPR Data Subject Request” or “UK GDPR Data Subject Request”, as applicable, in the subject line Include the following information: Your full name; your date of birth; your mailing address; your phone number; which subjects your request covers (Right of access, Right to rectification, Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten), Right to restriction of processing, Right to object, Right to data portability (transferability)). Please describe your request. To help you even more, we would like to know the reasons for your request. Specifically, if your request is to rectify your personal data, please provide a supplementary statement that addresses the way(s) in which your personal data is currently incomplete or otherwise incorrect. If your request is to restrict the processing of your personal data, explain whether (1) you are contesting the accuracy of your personal data and, if so, why; (2) you believe the processing is unlawful and, if so, why; (3) if you believe the Company no longer needs the personal data for processing; and/or (4) you are objecting due to your personal situation and, if so, explain that situation. If your request is to have the Company transfer your information, please provide us the electronic location or other transfer information where we can transfer your personal data. In regards to your right to object, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you, which is based on (1) the processing being necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of office authority vested with the Company or if the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the Company or a third party. Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. As such, if you are objecting to Company’s processing of your personal data, please provide the reason for your objection. If that reason is to object to direct marketing, please specify that as the reason for your objection. The Company reserves the right to refuse requests, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by law, including due to an inability of the Company to verify your identity or verify your authority to act on behalf of the data subject who is the subject of the request. The Company also reserves the right not to fulfill a request because if it is found to be manifestly unfounded or excessive. The Company may request clarification as to which processing activities a request relates, e.g., direct marketing, in the event a request is made with respect to the whole range of personal data requests without specifying what use of Personal Data the request is directed to. The Company will use the information you provide through this form to respond to your request, including verifying identify, identifying Personal Data responsive to your request, and keeping records of your request and by completing and submitting this form to the Company, you agree that this contact is by your consent. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in such circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure designed to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Users in Canada This Section provides additional information regarding the use of Personal Data about Canadian residents and the process to be followed in order to send unsolicited electronic communications to them, and our responsibilities under Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”). For the purposes of this section: Commercial activity: Any transaction of commercial character, regardless of whether there is an expectation of profit or not. Commercial electronic message (“CEM”): CEMs are commercial electronic messages that encourage participation in commercial activity. Even if a commercial message is not sent with an expectation of garnering profit, it still qualifies as a CEM. Electronic address: An address used in connection with the transmission of an electronic message to an electronic mail account, an instant messaging account, a telephone account or similar account. Electronic message: A message sent by any means of telecommunication, including text, sound, voice or image. Express consent: Permission obtained when a recipient “opts in” to receive CEMs. Consent can be oral or written and could be an unedited audio recording, paper or electronic checkbox on a website. Express consent never expires unless the recipient chooses to unsubscribe. We will maintain records of all contacts for whom express consent exists. Unsubscribe: A withdrawal of consent to receive CEMs By submitting forms to us that provide your electronic address, you are granting us express consent to send you CEMs. You may unsubscribe via the link found at the bottom of every electronic message. To unsubscribe from text messages, see our Text Messaging Terms and Conditions . All partners, employees, contractors, vendors and any other person sending CEMs on behalf of us will ensure that all such CEMs contain: Full contact information. This includes the sender’s first name, last name, title, company name, company mailing address, telephone number, email address and company web address. Information enabling you to contact us and, if the CEM is sent on behalf of another party, the name of this party and the sender, in addition to the information listed above. An unsubscribe link that is clearly visible and that is valid for at least 60 days. The unsubscribe mechanism that will be provided to users via this link will be simple, quick and easy for the user to perform. Unsubscribe Requests:  All unsubscribe requests will be managed within 10 days of receipt. Partners, employees, contractors, vendors and any other person sending CEMs on behalf of us will not send an unsubscribed party any further communications by electronic means. When we plan to introduce significant changes to privacy practices, we will notify Canadian-resident users and obtain their consent prior to the changes coming into effect. Significant changes include using Personal Data for a new purpose not anticipated originally or a new disclosure of Personal Data to a third party for a purpose other than processing that is integral to the delivery of a service. This Section provides additional information regarding the use of Personal Data about Canadian residents and the process to be followed in order to send unsolicited electronic communications to them, and our responsibilities under CASL.

The coalition includes building service workers union 32BJ SEIU, public employees union District Council 37, the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, the New York State Nurses Association and the Communications Workers of America District 1. The group is backing Assembly Member Harvey Epstein in the crowded race to represent lower Manhattan’s District 2. They’re unsurprisingly backing former 32BJ staffer Shirley Aldobol in the Democratic primary in Bronx District 13, which is currently represented by Republican City Council Member Kristy Marmorato. Aldobol already had the backing of 32BJ as well as the Bronx County Democratic Party. Labor Strong is also aligned with Bronx County in District 17, where it’s backing state Sen. Nathalia Fernandez’s staffer Justin Sanchez in the race to succeed City Council Land Use Chair Rafael Salamanca Jr. Speaker Adrienne Adams’ staffer Ty Hankerson got the coalition’s nod in the race to succeed her in Queens Council District 28. In Brooklyn’s District 47, it’s backing Justin Brannan staffer Kayla Santosuosso. The coalition has now endorsed in 27 City Council races. It has not yet endorsed against any Democratic incumbents, and has so far stayed out of a few contentious races. It hasn't weighed in on the high-dollar race to succeed Council Member Keith Powers in District 4 on the Upper East Side, for example, or the similarly high-profile races to succeed Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala or Queens Council Member Francisco Moya. It also hasn't weighed in on serious challenges to incumbents Chris Marte, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Kevin Riley or Darlene Mealy. A spokesperson for the group said “it’s possible” more endorsements could follow. In previous cycles, the Labor Strong independent expenditure committee has spent more than a million dollars supporting chosen candidates. It has not launched its committee yet for 2025, but plans to start spending closer to the primary date. Several of the unions in the coalition will play a role in selecting the next New York City Council speaker . “Our five unions are proud to stand together in our efforts to elect City Council candidates who truly support workers, unions, and the needs of our city’s working families,” the group said in a statement. “These candidates have earned our endorsement by demonstrating that they will support our unions and members, as well as fight to make New York City more affordable and livable for all. We look forward to using our collective power and resources to see each of them elected to the City Council.” The coalition is so far split on the New York City mayoral race. HTC and 32BJ SEIU have endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, while DC 37 endorsed Speaker Adams. CWA District 1 and NYSNA haven’t endorsed anyone yet. Here’s the full list of candidates the coalition is endorsing. Candidates in bold were most recently announced. An asterisk indicates an incumbent.

Jefferson | April 1, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 1, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Policy New York State It may be April Fools Day, but the soon to be late state budget is no laughing matter in Albany. The state Legislature passed a $1.7 billion budget extender on Tuesday that will fund the state government through Thursday. State Budget Director Blake Washington acknowledged yesterday that despite negotiations over the weekend, the 2026 Fiscal Year budget would not be settled by its April 1 deadline, and more extenders have been prepared. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have said that policy disputes, rather than concerns about finances, are the main thing holding up the budget, though there are also questions about how to fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s capital plan. Changes to discovery laws, an expansion of the involuntary commitment standard, a mask ban and a ban on cell phones in schools are among Gov. Kathy Hochul’s non-negotiable policy priorities. “We'll take as long as it takes to deliver,” Washington told reporters Monday. He said that the extender was primarily to fund Medicaid cycle payments and continue to pay the state’s workforce. Lawmakers do not receive their salary when the budget runs past its deadline. State Senate Republicans are not pleased with how negotiations are proceeding. State Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt said that New Yorkers were seeing was a failure in leadership from Democrats in state government. “I’d rather have a good budget than an on time budget, that’s Rob Ortt,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But we’re going to have neither, we’re going to have a bad budget and it’s going to be late.” Last week, Stewart-Cousins and Heastie indicated that negotiations had made significant progress, but discovery reform was proving to be a sticking point – in particular because the governor’s team has not yet sent the specific language for its most recent proposal. Heastie said that Assembly members have made clear in conference that they have significant reservations about any rollbacks to legislation that would speed up trials. It’s not clear yet what stage budget negotiations are currently at, but lawmakers are prepared to go into next week. If a budget agreement isn’t reached by Thursday, another extender would be passed to fund the government through Monday, and the cycle would repeat itself until lawmakers and Hochul finally find common ground. This will be the governor’s fourth straight late budget; last year’s budget didn’t pass until April 20.

Lewis | April 2, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 2, 2025 Immigration Criminal Justice Albany Agenda Policy New York State In the wake of the high-profile detention of a mother and her three children upstate by federal immigration agents, immigrant advocates are once again demanding that state lawmakers pass legislation banning jails and prisons in New York from contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It’s one of several measures that activists are pushing for, as New York officials have largely taken a hands-off approach to strengthening immigrant protections since President Donald Trump started his mass deportation efforts. The Dignity Not Detention Act would make it illegal for local governments to contract with ICE to hold immigrants at correctional facilities. The most significant example of that cooperation is the Orange County Correctional Facility, which as of last month held more than 80 immigrants detained by ICE . Only the federal ICE detention facility in Batavia holds more detained immigrants in New York. Clinton County Jail also works with ICE to serve as an immigrant detention center. Three counties – Nassau, Rensselaer and Broome – have signed agreements with ICE that permit their local jails to hold immigrants in order for them to be picked up by federal officials. While the Dignity Not Detention Act would not prevent immigration-related arrests in New York, supporters say it’s important for the state to minimize its cooperation with ICE. “We are living in a very scary and difficult time,” said Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who sponsors the bill. “This piece of legislation was meant to really carve us a line in the sand about what our New York values are.” Gov. Kathy Hochul has cranked up her rhetorical defenses of immigrants in New York following statements from last year that drew criticism from advocates. On Tuesday, she blasted the Trump administration after ICE detained a woman and her three school-age children while officials served a warrant for a different individual upstate. “I cannot think of any public safety justification for ICE agents to rip an innocent family, including a child in the third grade, from their Sackets Harbor home,” Hochul said in a statement. “That is not the immigration enforcement promised to the American people. It's just plain cruel.” She demanded the immediate return of the family. However, the governor has not signaled support for any number of bills that immigration advocates are pushing in the state Legislature. After activists praised Hochul for what they perceived as backing the New York for All Act – which would codify and expand sanctuary protections statewide – her office denied that she has taken any position on the bill. Her executive budget proposal included $44 million for immigrant legal services, far less than the $165 million that advocates want. As for the Dignity Not Detention Act, a spokesperson for Hochul said she would review the legislation if lawmakers approve it. Neither legislative chamber has advanced major immigration-related legislation yet this year, including the Dignity Not Detention Act. Lawmakers passed the Protect Our Courts Act in 2019 during the first Trump administration, which prohibits ICE agents from making arrests in and around courthouses barring a warrant signed by a judge. But in spite of the hopes of some legislators that New York would take swift action to pass additional protections to combat mass deportation efforts, the Legislature has not passed any of the major bills that advocates want. In the meantime, the ICE presence in New York has increased, with two new counties signing cooperation agreements and border czar Tom Homan promising to flood the state with immigration agents if state officials don’t cooperate with the federal government. The U.S. Department of Justice is also suing New York over a 2019 law that permits undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses but limits federal access to Department of Motor Vehicle data. “I have to be honest that I'm very disappointed in the way that New York state legislators have been ignoring this issue on immigration,” said Tania Mattos, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group UnLocal.

Jefferson | April 14, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 14, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget News & Politics Policy New York State Albany insiders think the state budget might drag into May as legislative leaders appear incapable of coming to a meaningful compromise on policy items after weeks of closed-door negotiations. Gov. Kathy Hochul said she wouldn’t mind spending her summer negotiating in  Albany , but so far it’s been a dreary spring. This wouldn’t be the first time that Hochul has delayed a budget until May; in 2023, the budget was held up due to fierce debates over rolling back bail reform and only passed on May 3. There are a few deadlines, legal and spiritual, that Hochul has to contend with as she holds firm on her budget goals. The first was April 1, the date that the state is supposed to have a budget in place – though it’s more of a suggestion than an actual deadline at this point. Hochul and the Legislature easily blew past that deadline. The next was Passover on April 12, which normally marks the start of a two-week holiday for the Legislature. But without an on-time budget, they’ll now be back in Albany passing temporary extenders for a few more weeks. At this point, the only people truly aware of the lack of progress are Albany politicos and state lawmakers who had to cancel a spring getaway. If there isn’t a budget in place by May 20, though, it will impact school boards in New York and the communities they serve, which will need to vote on their own budgets by then. Without a firm answer on Foundation Aid – the main mechanism to fund state public schools – districts will be in a sticky position and could be left wondering why they can’t get a firm answer on the resources they’ll have to work with. According to legislative leaders like Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, substantive work on the fiscal sections of the state budget has taken a backseat to policy debates, which have yielded little progress as lawmakers prepare to pass a fifth budget extender on Tuesday. There is talk that Hochul’s cheery outlook on protracted negotiations will lead to a budget that comes in noticeably later than last year’s April 20 agreement. Discovery reform is the main sticking point in budget negotiations, although an expansion of involuntary commitment and a mask ban are also gumming up the works. In her executive budget proposal, Hochul included changes to the state’s discovery law meant to address prosecutors’ concerns that too many cases were being dismissed on technicalities. The governor’s proposal would allow judges to impose less severe penalties for prosecutors who fail to turn over evidence on time and would also allow prosecutors to only turn over materials to the defense that they deem “relevant” to the case, rather than all material “related” to the case. Lawmakers and criminal justice reformers are concerned that the changes would create a more unjust legal system and reduce any impetus for prosecutors to act in a timely fashion, and some are prepared to dig in their heels. The dynamic is creating a situation where policies that the average New Yorker might not even know about, let alone fully grasp, are affecting their day-to-day lives and contributing to a sense of Albany’s inherent dysfunction. Blair Horner, senior policy advisor at the New York Public Interest Group, said that a budget so late that it calls back to the Pataki era – when the budget often wasn’t finalized until June or July – could set back public trust. “It is obviously an important component, not only to the schools, but to the communities that these lawmakers are elected from, and there's no getting around it,” Horner told City & State. “It makes Albany look bad. The budget being late makes Albany look bad. And it does throw a sort of body blow to the public's trust in their own government. They're supposed to get the budget done by April 1.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda State budget unlikely to be finished before end of month Will April policy debates bring a May budget deal?

Jefferson | April 24, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 24, 2025 Budget Policy Taxes Albany Agenda New York State Two state lawmakers think taxing the stock market could plug future holes in the state budget and help fund major policy initiatives. State Sen. James Sanders and Assembly Member Phil Steck are reviving a push to reinstate a five-cent tax on stock trades that take place in New York. The bill is projected to bring in $14 to $16 billion annually, and Sanders and Steck view it as a possible defense as the federal budget is expected to slash funding for expensive state-run programs like Medicaid. Taxing stock trades isn’t new in New York. A five-cent levy on sales of stock worth more than $20 was in place from 1905 to 1981, when lawmakers eliminated it. Legislative proposals to bring it back have cropped up in recent years. In 2021, state Sen. Julia Salazar and former Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou attempted to reinstate the tax , but pushback from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the financial sector prevented any progress. Five years later, lawmakers making a renewed push for a stock tax face Gov. Kathy Hochul’s commitment to keep taxes flat. Her office told City & State that she would review the legislation if and when it passed the Legislature. The New York Stock Exchange did not respond to requests for comment. Recognizing the uphill battle to get the bill passed one day, Steck said it would take a wide base of support and financial peril to see any progress. “To pass this bill would require a movement, and I think unfortunately, would probably require dealing with a lot of federal cuts that are important,” Steck told City & State. “The governor is just too corporate-oriented to support this, and the speaker is afraid Wall Street will leave New York City.” Steck and Sanders held a rally Wednesday near the New York Stock Exchange with faith leaders, education advocates, economic experts and environmentalists. Sanders said it was essential to protect New York from the Trump administration’s potential funding cuts. “I think that we have a secret weapon for support in Albany. I think that we have an orange guy down in DC who is determined to make sure that New York does not have enough money to carry on the business of New York,” he said. “So I think that once we realize that he is kind enough to devastate us, we need to move in an affirmative fashion, and we need to make sure that our police are paid, that the fire department is paid, that the roads are paved and that education takes place.”. – With reporting from Holly Pretsky Share This: NEXT STORY: DOCCS wanted people convicted of violent crimes to be eligible for early release Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Budget Could a stock transfer tax help NYC weather the Trump administration?

Recognizing the uphill battle to get the bill passed one day, Steck said it would take a wide base of support and financial peril to see any progress. “To pass this bill would require a movement, and I think unfortunately, would probably require dealing with a lot of federal cuts that are important,” Steck told City & State. “The governor is just too corporate-oriented to support this, and the speaker is afraid Wall Street will leave New York City.” Steck and Sanders held a rally Wednesday near the New York Stock Exchange with faith leaders, education advocates, economic experts and environmentalists. Sanders said it was essential to protect New York from the Trump administration’s potential funding cuts. “I think that we have a secret weapon for support in Albany. I think that we have an orange guy down in DC who is determined to make sure that New York does not have enough money to carry on the business of New York,” he said. “So I think that once we realize that he is kind enough to devastate us, we need to move in an affirmative fashion, and we need to make sure that our police are paid, that the fire department is paid, that the roads are paved and that education takes place.”. – With reporting from Holly Pretsky Share This:     NEXT STORY: DOCCS wanted people convicted of violent crimes to be eligible for early release Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one News & Politics Albany Agenda Campaign Confidential New York City New York State Campaigns & Elections Heard Around Town News & Politics Ask the Experts Announcements Policy Budget Criminal Justice Education Energy & Environment Ethics Gambling Healthcare Housing Immigration Infrastructure Labor Policy Publisher's Section Small Business Technology Transportation Personality Interviews & Profiles Personality Winners & Losers Power List Opinion Commentary Editor's Note Opinion NYN Media Nonprofits List Nominations First Read Sign up Featured Announcements Magazine Subscribe Issues Media Podcasts Videos Resource Directory Events Conferences Network Receptions Award Ceremony Past Events Jobs Products Why Post with Us About NY Nonprofit Jobs About Staff Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Use Merchandise Awards, Plaques & Permissions Follow Us     Help us tailor content specifically for you: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Yes, I want to receive occasional updates from partners I agree to the use of my personal data by Government Executive

Scorecards Scorecards A scorecard evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.  To contribute to the list of New York scorecards, email suggestions to editor@ballotpedia.org .  2024 2024 In 2024, the New York State Legislature was in session from January 3 to June 8.

Two elections were for state Senate seats, and nine elections  were for state Assembly seats. Two Assembly seats switched party control. District 10 flipped from Republican to Democratic control, and District 142 flipped from Democratic to Republican control. Most media attention  focused on the race between Assemblywoman Shelley Mayer (D) and former Rye City Councilwoman Julie Killian (R) to replace George Latimer (D) in Senate District 37 . Mayer won the race. The election was originally thought to be critical in deciding whether Democrats would gain control of the New York State Senate and trifecta control of the state government in 2018. However, on April 24, state Sen. Simcha Felder (D) announced he would continue caucusing with the Senate Republicans regardless of the race's outcome, leaving them with a 32-31 effective majority. [1] Prior to Felder's announcement, Democrats were looking to win a 32-31 majority by winning both the District 37 and the more safely-Democratic District 32 special elections and convincing Felder to end his alliance with Republicans. An alliance between the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), Felder, and the Senate Republicans had kept the GOP in control of the state Senate since 2013, despite Democrats often having a numerical majority. The Senate's mainline Democrats and the eight-member IDC agreed to reunify into a single Democratic caucus in April 2018. To learn more about the conflict between the mainline Democrats and the IDC, visit our key events section. To see how this conflict might have played out in the 2018 Democratic state legislative primaries, visit this page . Similar to 2017 state legislative special elections in Delaware and Washington , trifecta control of New York would have been on the line for Democrats if Felder had not committed to the Republicans. After Democrats gained a trifecta in Washington in November 2017, Democrats acted on a number of their priorities in the 2018 legislative session , including firearms policy, capital punishment, and net neutrality. New York Democrats' ability to influence policy in 2018 would have likely been limited, however. The state budget passed in late March and a slim Democratic Senate majority that included Felder, a conservative Democrat, might not have been able to pass the party's preferred legislation on issues like abortion, college tuition, and immigration.

Killian was selected as the Republican nominee over former Yonkers inspector general Dan Schorr at a nomination convention held on February 7. Bedford attorney Sarmad Khojasteh had been seeking the nomination, but he withdrew from consideration on February 5 and endorsed Killian, saying she was the candidate best suited to face Mayer in the special election. Killian faced Latimer in the 2016 election and lost by an 11-point margin. [12] Mayer was selected as the Democratic nominee by a unanimous vote at the Democratic convention on January 9, 2018. Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano had been seeking the nomination as well, but he withdrew his name before the convention was held. [13] What was at stake?  What was at stake? Prior to state Sen. Simcha Felder's (D) election day announcement that he would continue caucusing with Senate Republicans regardless of the race's outcome, the District 37 race was set to determine whether Democrats would control of the New York State Senate and trifecta control of New York's state government in 2018. The Senate's mainline Democrats and the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), who previously aligned with Senate Republicans, agreed to reunify into a single Democratic caucus on April 4, 2018. If Democrats had retained both District 37 and the more-safely Democratic District 32 in the April 24 special elections and state Sen. Simcha Felder (D) had ended his separate alliance with Senate Republicans, Democrats would have had a 32-31 majority in the chamber. Democrats won 32 of the Senate's 63 seats in 2016, but a power-sharing agreement between the 31 Senate Republicans, the IDC, and Felder kept the 23 mainline Democrats in the minority. Republicans took outright control of the state Senate (31-30 majority) when mainline Democrats Latimer and Diaz resigned in January 2018 to take local-level positions they were elected to in November 2017. Democrats control the state Assembly and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is the governor, meaning Democrats only needed to win the state Senate to have trifecta control in New York.   Democratic Party 32   Republican Party 31 [14] Political analysis Political analysis New York Times : "On Wednesday, [Gov. Cuomo] — with a primary challenge in the offing — launched a salvo in an effort to convince [Simcha Felder] that the time to come home was now, warning that his unique influence in the Capitol might not last past the November elections. 'Let me say that the Democratic conference will not need you in November the way they need you now,' the governor wrote in a letter to Mr. Felder and distributed to the news media. 'I believe there will be additional Democrats who win and are seated for the next Legislature. You have said that you act in the best interest of your constituents. For their benefit, now is the time that matters.' For all that rhetoric, however, it was not clear that Mr. Cuomo, or other Democrats, had enough leverage to convince Mr. Felder that he would pay a political price, and even if so, whether they would use it any time soon. Indeed, the governor’s letter was met with a polite shrug from Mr. Felder — 'I look forward to productive conversations with the governor and respect his position,' he said on Wednesday — and little, if any, immediate follow-up... One group, however, was undeniably happy about Mr. Felder’s decision. Before a brief legislative session on Wednesday in Albany, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads the Senate, addressed his Republican colleagues, with Mr. Felder in attendance, and thanked him for staying. The Republican conference then gave Mr. Felder a round of applause." [15] Candidates Candidates Shelley Mayer (D)  Shelley Mayer (D) A Democratic Assemblywoman from Assembly District 90, Mayer was nominated to run in the special election for District 37 in January 2018. When accepting the nomination, Mayer said, "Now, more than ever before, we need united and strong progressive leadership in Albany. We cannot let the bigoted and hate-filled leadership in Washington take hold in Westchester. Democrats will continue to come together and rise up against those who try to use fear and hatred to undermine our unity." [13] Her website listed endorsements from a number of union locals, including the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Her site emphasized her positions on education , property taxes , climate change , and women's issues . [16] Mayer was first elected to the state Assembly in a 2012 special election and then won re-election in 2014 and 2016. She earned her B.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1975 and her J.D. from State University of New York, Buffalo, School of Law in 1979. Her professional experience includes working as the chief counsel for the New York State Senate Democrats from 2007 to 2011 and serving as assistant attorney general in the Office of New York Attorney General Bob Abrams from 1982 to 1994.  Julie Killian (R)  Julie Killian (R) A former councilwoman from Rye, New York. Killian was selected as the Republican nominee at a convention on February 7, 2018. [17] She ran for the District 37 seat in 2016 and lost to George Latimer (D). Her policy priorities included enacting term limits for state legislators and changing the state's funding formula for public education. Her website also listed government corruption , property taxes , and substance abuse as the issues she wanted to address. [18] According to the Legislative Gazette , Killian represented a more centrist wing of the Republican Party; she has called for more restrictions on firearms and environmental protection policies. [19] Prior to serving on the Rye City Council, Killian co-founded the nonprofit RyeACT, which focused on ending substance abuse by children and teenagers. She also worked in the financial services industry on Wall Street. She received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Notre Dame and an M.B.A. from New York University. [20]  Campaign activity Campaign activity The District 37 race was viewed by both parties as a winnable race despite its preference for Democrats in recent elections and Democrats' two-to-one advantage in registered voters. [21] According to the newspaper Lohud , "it has been a target of Republicans in expensive campaign battles in recent years and is expected to once again be viewed as a target seat by the state GOP." [13] Campaign finance Campaign finance On February 5, Senate Democrats sent out a fundraising letter that cited the race's high stakes. It said, “As long as Republicans hold power in the State Senate, New York can’t stand up to President Trump and pass laws to protect our families from the awful policies coming out of Washington. Together, we can give New Yorkers the state government they deserve and make history by elevating the first woman to lead the New York State Senate. The fight for the Senate Majority is here." [22] Cuomo appeared at a fundraiser for Mayer on April 3 and called for an end to Republican control of the state Senate. "All the progress we want to make, (Republicans) are 100 percent against it," said Cuomo. "We just finished a budget, negotiating with them. They have no appetite whatsoever for any of the things we hold dear." [23] As of April 16, $3.4 million was spent on the race, with each candidate spending about $1 million apiece and $1.5 million coming from satellite groups . Of the $3.4 million, $2.3 million was spent on television and radio advertising ($1.9 million for Killian and $450,000 for Mayer) and about $400,000 was spent on campaign mailers ($205,000 for Killian and $190,000 for Mayer). Of the $1.5 million in satellite spending , $800,000 was for anti-Mayer ads by the pro-charter school group New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany.

Campaign themes Campaign themes The following positions were listed on the candidates' campaign websites: Julie Killian “ The high cost of living, working and raising a family in New York State is forcing thousands of New Yorkers to flee to more affordable parts of the country. I will bring a fresh perspective and fight every single day as your Senator to make Westchester a safe and affordable place where opportunities abound for all Westchester families.  Below is a small sample of some of the ideas I have. If you want to know more please call or email! AFFORDABILITY In Westchester, our property taxes are among the highest in the country.  There are things we can do in state government that will directly affect your property taxes: When elected, I will fight to: CHANGE the school aid formula so Westchester gets its fair share.  Right now we get the LOWEST per student school aid in the state. MOVE Medicaid back to the state level from the county level. New York is one of the few states that pays for a portion of Medicaid at the county level. MAKE the property tax cap permanent. It has saved taxpayers $23 billion since 2012. INSTITUTE a tax cap on the state budget. STOP the corruption tax by strengthening and enforcing ethics laws and requiring conflict of interest statements for every Legislator and State contract. This was my first official act when I joined the Rye City Council in June 2012 after a corruption scandal. OPPORTUNITY Countless studies highlight the fact that New York has one of the worst business climates in the nation. We must create a more hospitable environment for small and medium sized businesses, as they are the backbone of our economy and create the jobs our citizens need to thrive. When elected, I will fight to: PROHIBIT state agencies from fining small businesses for first violations unless public health or safety is jeopardized. STREAMLINE occupational licensing and the permitting process for opening new businesses and growing existing businesses. EXPAND Career and Technical Education (CTE) high schools beyond New York City to offer pathways to career success for those who may not be interested in a four-year college. AMEND tax code to ensure 529 plans get the same tax treatment at the state level that federal law provides to make education more affordable. ADVOCATE on behalf of families and service providers in the OPWDD (Office for People with Developmental Disabilities) system to make sure new procedures provide more access, more services and more reimbursement not less. EXPAND education and job opportunities for developmentally disabled and autistic students and adults. SECURITY The first obligation of any government is the safety and security of its citizens. We must all work together to keep our children and families safe. When elected, I will fight to: PASS a new law that reclassifies school shootings as acts of Domestic Terrorism. SUPPORT legislation that provides funding for local school districts to invest in security equipment and school resource officers to help secure school infrastructure. SUPPORT common sense gun laws including universal background checks, banning bump stocks and fully-automatic assault weapons, and raising the age to buy a firearm to 21. PROTECT families by supporting proposals that would keep guns out of the wrong hands, including the Extreme Risk Protection Order bill, which would make it possible for families and law enforcement to remove firearms from loved ones who could be a danger to themselves or others, and making permanent Kendra’s Law, which grants judges the authority to issue orders that require people who meet certain criteria to regularly undergo psychiatric treatment. ESTABLISH a research institute that will look at the myriad causes of gun violence. PROTECT women, children and any vulnerable New Yorkers by fighting for legislation that would promote greater accountability for harassment issues and prohibit confidentiality agreements unless the victim requests that his or her identity be kept private. COMBAT heroin, opioid and substance abuse crisis with more funding at local and county level for proven prevention programs, education efforts for teens, parents and school and medical professionals. I have a specific plan on this coming out soon! FIGHT to make Fetanyl a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (like heroin) so dealers can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Currently, the NYS Assembly will not pass this change. FUND early intervention and prevention efforts in our elementary schools focused on educating parents, training teachers and working with students so that kids don’t turn to drugs and alcohol when they are facing challenges. FUND after school programs in underserved areas to keep our kids busy and more importantly expose them to sports, art, music and STEM programs. ENVIRONMENT Our district includes some of the most beautiful natural resources in the country, including the Long Island Sound and the Hudson River. Clean water, clean air and open space should be the right of every citizen. The stewardship of our environment is a great responsibility; what we do, or do not do, will impact generations to come. When elected, I will fight to: ENSURE adequate funding for the environmental protection measures, including the Environmental Protection Fund and the Clean Water Infrastructure Act. MEET renewable energy goals of 50 percent generation by 2030. This is particularly critical in light of the recent, extensive power outages the region experienced, as well as the closing of Indian Point, which is responsible for 25 percent of the energy Westchester residents consume. INCORPORATE climate change science into emergency response plans to ensure we are prepared for future disasters such as Superstorm Sandy. BUILD RESILIENCY by supporting our local municipalities and County and help fund efforts to address coastal erosion and flood mitigation and  manage our wetlands. ADVOCATE for continued engagement with the NYC Billion Oyster Project to bring it to Westchester. Worked with Rye City officials and our local middle school to bring a program to our local harbor,  the first of its kind in Westchester. Oysters filter an average of 50 gallons of water each day.

[34] ” —Julie Killian’s campaign website (2018) [35] Shelley Mayer “ Shelley Mayer is the Change We Need
From Yonkers to Bedford, from White Plains to the Sound Shore, Shelley knows our communities and has always been willing to stand up against the status quo to protect Westchester, Her children all attended public schools here, so she's always been an advocate for better school funding and tuition relief, She fought the NRA to pass effective, common-sense gun laws, and defeated big pharma to give us better tools to fight opioid abuse. CLEANING UP ALBANY'S CULTURE OF CORRUPTION Shelley has never been afraid to stand up to corruption, even if it meant taking on members of her own party. As Counsel to the State Senate Democrats, Shelley was the architect of an unprecedented legal effort to expel disgraced Senator Hiram Monserrate from office after he was convicted of domestic violence. As a State Assemblymember, Shelley led the Reform Caucus and one of the first members to call on Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to resign when he was indicted on corruption charges. Shelley Mayer has always stood up for what's right, helping pass a law to strip the pensions of public officials who violate the public trust and fighting for legislation that cracks down on politicians who use their offices for private gain. STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPERTY TAX CAP TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS Westchester is a beautiful place to live and raise a family, but high taxes and increasing costs are making it harder and harder by the day. Now, the new Trump tax plan will crush Westchester’s residents – who already pay some of the highest property taxes in the nation. As State Senator, Shelley will stand with the Governor to fight back against Trump’s assault on New Yorkers by supporting the New York State Taxpayer Protection Act; and she’ll work with local leaders to promote shared services and other cost-saving measures. Shelley has voted for and passed two major tax cuts in the past five years. Now, the new Trump tax plan will crush Westchester’s residents who already pay some of the highest property taxes in the nation. As State Senator, Shelley will stand with the Governor to fight back against Trump’s assault on New Yorkers and she’ll work with local leaders to promote shared services and other cost-saving measures. STANDING UP TO THE NRA TO PASS STRONGER GUN SAFETY LAWS Shelley has stood up to the NRA to pass the NY Safe Act, one of the toughest gun laws in the nation which requires stricter background checks, bans assault weapons, and cracks down on out-of-state gun dealers in New York. In the State Senate, she’ll stand up to Republican efforts to repeal the Safe Act, and she’ll break through Republican roadblocks for common sense legislation to ban deadly bump stocks, or keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals and children. As our nation awakens and finally stands up to demand action on gun safety, Shelley knows that we need to change the Senate’s leadership to end the NRA’s stranglehold on our State Senate. REFORMING OUTDATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWS AND DEFENDING WOMENS RIGHTS Shelley has spent her career standing up for gender equality, women’s access to healthcare, equal pay, and an end to sexual harassment and abuse. In the Senate, she’ll work to end the Senate Republicans’ years-long roadblock on critical legislation including the Reproductive Health Act and the Child Victims Act. In addition, Shelley strongly supports Governor Cuomo’s proposed reforms to prevent sexual harassment and better protect victims. DELIVERING FAIR FUNDING FOR ALL OUR SCHOOLS Shelley is a lifelong advocate for strong public schools, delivering record funding for local schools as an Assemblymember and securing over half a billion dollars for school construction and renovation. As State Senator, she’ll work every day to ensure that Westchester schools get their fair share; stand strong against the misuse and overuse of standardized testing; and protect the rights of parents to have a say in their children’s schools. ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND FLOODING With Westchester sandwiched between the Hudson River and the Sound shore coastline, we are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change – from increased flooding to wind damage from major storms. Shelley Mayer has been a vigorous advocate for the protection of our environment, cosponsoring a bill that prohibited oil barges from anchoring in the Hudson River and securing $3 million for flood mitigation aid after Hurricane Sandy. Shelley also believes that climate change denial is a hurting our future and supported Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill that would help put New York on track to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change through a reduction in statewide greenhouse gas emissions and improve the resiliency of the state with respect to the impacts and risks of climate change. COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC The opioid crisis is one of the most serious problems facing Westchester and New York State. While in the Assembly, Shelley sponsored legislation that makes naloxone, a life-saving drug that stops opioid overdoses, more easily available. The law requires any pharmacy with 20 or more locations to pursue or maintain a standing order to disperse naloxone or to register with the NYS Department of Health as an Opioid Overdose Prevention Program. These requirements ensure that more pharmacists will be trained in administering naloxone and Governor Cuomo signed it into law in 2016. In the State Senate, Shelley will continue to advocate for programs that support those battling addiction and resources that crack down on the prevalence of opioids in Westchester and across New York.

[34] ” —John Doe’s campaign website (2016) [36] The Trump effect The Trump effect Candidate approach to Trump Candidate approach to Trump The presidency of Donald Trump was an issue in this campaign. Both candidates issued statements about Donald Trump's presidency. After accepting the Democratic nomination to run for the seat, Mayer said, "Now, more than ever before, we need united and strong progressive leadership in Albany. We cannot let the bigoted and hate-filled leadership in Washington take hold in Westchester. Democrats will continue to come together and rise up against those who try to use fear and hatred to undermine our unity." [13] Killian downplayed Trump's relevance in the race, saying, “The election is not about Donald Trump no matter how much the Democrats want to make it about him. And if that’s all they can talk about, it’s clear that they don’t have any solutions to deal with the problems in our community and they don’t understand the problems in our community.” [37] Mayer and her allies  invoked Trump on the campaign trail. She criticized Killian for a $1,000 donation she received from George DeVos, the husband of Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos , in her 2016 bid for Senate. At a campaign event supporting Mayer, Gov. Cuomo reportedly criticized Trump and his administration on multiple occasions. [38] Voter reception of Trump Voter reception of Trump Before George Latimer was elected Westchester County executive over incumbent Rob Astorino (R) in November 2017, the firm Appliedtechonomics ran a survey and found that 44 percent of voters said the Trump administration would be a factor in how they voted and that 67 percent of those voters backed Latimer over Astorino. Latimer ended up winning the election by 13 points, which was higher than expected by political observers. According to Jeanne Zaino, an executive at Appliedtechonomics and a political scientist, "In the past, the GOP has been able to overcome deficits by running strong candidates on issues like taxes that voters care so much about...The Democratic avalanche [in Latimer's election], however, showed that as important as taxes are to Westchester voters, there is now another issue that gets them even more vexed: Trump. " [38]  Noteworthy events Noteworthy events Mayer removed from Independence Party line Mayer removed from Independence Party line Mayer was removed from the Independence Party line by Justice Henry Zwack on March 20 after he found that she had received the party's nomination in February without there being a quorum present. Candidates can run under multiple party lines in New York. Killian received the Independence Party's nomination in her 2016 run against Latimer. [39] Ethics complaint against Mayer Ethics complaint against Mayer Republicans filed a complaint with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics alleging that Mayer misused government property. The complaint concerned a Facebook video that showed Mayer inside her Assembly office commending students who participated in walkouts from schools to protest gun violence. She used the phrase “when elected to the Senate,” which the complaint said showed that the video was intended to be campaign material. In response, Mayer said, “This is a sad and frankly pathetic attempt by Killian to distract from her and her Trump allies’ extremist pro-gun agenda of allowing more guns in our schools and allowing the NRA to control our state government.” [40] Mayer's handling of sexual misconduct claims  Mayer's handling of sexual misconduct claims In April 2018, state Senate staffers Julia Lilkendey and Shana Wittenwyler accused Mayer of not acting to help them after they told her that they were being sexually harassed in 2011. Mayer was serving as chief counsel for the Senate Democrats at the time they made their complaints. [41] Mayer said that she followed proper protocol after receiving the complaints and that Secretary of the Senate Angelo Aponte did not take action on them. [42] After the allegations were reported by the New York Daily News , Killian called for Mayer to resign from the state Assembly. [42] She made this announcement in front of Mayer's campaign headquarters and, according to Lohud , fighting, physical and verbal, broke out among Mayer and Killian supporters. [43] Andrea Stewart-Cousins defended Mayer, saying, "Unfortunately this is the double standard that women in the workplace face — you can stand up for victims of sexual harassment, as Shelley did, only to be shot down by men in higher-ranking positions, then you still get blamed for not doing enough." [42] On April 17, Lilkendey and Wittenwyler filed a formal request with the Senate for an ethics investigation into Mayer's handling of their claims. In response, Mayer's spokesman said, "bringing a complaint against the woman who tried to help rather than the man who was actually responsible seems misguided, but every woman has a right to seek justice when she has been harassed." [44] Killian returns money to fundraiser following critical remarks about David Hogg Killian returns money to fundraiser following critical remarks about David Hogg In April 2018, Julie Killian returned donations she received from Denise Ward after Ward tweeted out statements critical of David Hogg, a survivor of a February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and advocate for increasing regulations on firearms. After Hogg called for a boycott of Fox News host Laura Ingram, who criticized him for not being admitted into several colleges for which he applied, Ward tweeted, "Every time that idiotic Hogg person speaks I am compelled to do the opposite of whatever he's advocating, because it's so clear that he's nothing more than a tool & a drone." Mayer's campaign criticized Killian for her association with Ward, saying, "No amount of campaign cash is worth appeasing those who attack children, let alone those who have survived a tragic school shooting." Killian said she disagreed with Ward and that she returned her donations. She also tweeted, "We have thousands of supporters & I would guess there are one or two of [Mayer]'s supporters who also hold views w/whom she would wildly disagree." [45] District 37 context District 37 context Recent elections Recent elections State Sen. George Latimer (D) was first elected to the seat in 2012 after serving in the New York Assembly as the representative from District 91 since 2005. Before Latimer took the District 37 seat, it had been represented by Sen. Suzi Oppenheimer (D) since 1984. Latimer was elected as a Westchester County executive in November 2017, and he resigned as the District 37 senator in January 2017 in order to take that position. In Latimer's three elections in 2012, 2014, and 2016, the results varied depending on whether or not it was a presidential election year. In the two presidential election years, 2012 and 2016, turnout for the race was at well over 100,000 voters and Latimer won by nearly or more than a double-digit percentage margin. In the lower turnout 2014 election, less than 75,000 voters turned out and Latimer's margin of victory was just 4.1 percent. The chart below shows Latimer's margins of victory in terms of raw votes and the percentages of the vote in all three of his elections to the New York Senate. 2016 election (vote totals) George Latimer 73,116 Julie Killian 58,164 131,280 D+14,952 2016 election (percentages) George Latimer 55.7 percent Julie Killian 44.3 percent - D+11.4% 2014 election (vote totals) George Latimer 38,092 Joseph Dillon 34,913 73,005 D+3,179 2014 election (percentages) George Latimer 49.9 percent Joseph Dillon 45.8 percent - D+4.1% 2012 election (vote totals) George Latimer 64,236 Bob Cohen 54,574 118,810 D+9,662 2012 election (percentages) George Latimer 54.1 percent Bob Cohen 45.9 percent - D+8.2% The chart below details the results of presidential elections in New York State Senate District 37.

[12] According to Statistical Atlas in 2017, the district was 67.2 percent white, 18.7 percent Latino, 6.8 percent black, and 5.4 percent Asian. Its proportion of white and Latino residents were 9.4 percent and 2.0 percent greater than the state average, respectively, while its proportion of black and Asian residents were 8.9 percent and 2.2 percent lower, respectively. As for educational attainment, 53.7 percent of the population had received a degree higher than a high school diploma, which was 12.1 percent higher than the state average of 41.6 percent. Only 35.3 percent of the population received just a high school diploma (compared to 43.5 percent of the state's population) and just 11 percent of the population received less education than a high school diploma (compared to nearly 15 percent of the state's population). [46]   IDC and Mainline Democratic reunification IDC and Mainline Democratic reunification Prior to April 2018, factions in the New York State Senate included the mainline Democratic Party , the Republican Party , and an offshoot of the Democratic Party called the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC). Republicans controlled the chamber from 2012 to 2018 through an alliance with the IDC and Democrat Simcha Felder . In April 2018, the eight members of the IDC rejoined the mainline Democratic conference, but Felder stayed with the Republicans, giving them an effective 32-31 majority in the chamber. In the September 13 Democratic primaries , progressive primary challengers defeated former IDC leader Jeff Klein and former IDC members Tony Avella , Jose Peralta , Jesse Hamilton , Marisol Alcantara , and David Valesky . Felder and former IDC members Diane Savino and David Carlucci won their primaries. Read more here . Klein In late 2017, Buffalo Mayor and New York Democratic Party Chairman Byron Brown began applying pressure to IDC leader Jeff Klein and mainline Democratic leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins to reunify their caucuses. If the two sides could not work together in the state Senate, the state party said it would run primary challengers against IDC members and possibly change up the leadership among the mainline Democrats. If they could, however, Klein and Stewart-Cousins were to hold co-leadership positions in a chamber controlled by a Democratic majority for the first time since 2010. Moreover, the IDC and the mainline Democrats would be able to approve the other side's deputies. According to the New York Times , this was important because Klein had a feud with state Sen. Michael Gianaris , who served as Stewart-Cousins' deputy and was an IDC critic. Stewart-Cousins Both Klein and Stewart-Cousins responded positively to the proposal and suggested that they were willing to work together in the 2018 legislative session. [47] Stewart-Cousins told the New York Daily News that the proposed alliance depended on the outcome of special elections in 2018 where Democrats would need to replace two of their members-- Ruben Diaz (D) and George Latimer (D)-- who resigned to take local elected positions in order to maintain a 32-31 numerical majority in the chamber. The special elections were scheduled for April 24, 2018. With the seats held by Latimer and Diaz vacant, Republicans held a 31-30 numerical majority in the chamber. She said that Democrats would also have to convince Simcha Felder (D) to end his alliance with Republicans and begin caucusing with Democrats. She said that if she was not the majority leader by the end of the 2018 legislative session, then the mainline Democrats and potentially the state party might back primary challenges against the IDC members. Felder Stewart-Cousins dismissed concerns that the Democrats would not be able to take control of the chamber from Republicans in the middle of the session due to a rule requiring 38 members to change leadership during a session. She said, “I think we will be in a position as the majority to make the rules." She also said she was not worried about a potential court challenge to a leadership change by Senate Republicans. [48] In December 2017, Sen. Felder chose to remain with the Republicans until the state budget was passed (the deadline was at the end of March 2018), meaning Republicans would retain control of the chamber until at least mid-2018. Felder previously said that he would align with the party that focused on his legislative priorities, including securing funding for yeshivas and placing armed guards in New York City schools. [49] On April 4, 2018, Klein and Stewart-Cousins agreed to reunify immediately in a new agreement proposed by Gov. Cuomo. The agreement was reached at a closed-door meeting at a Manhattan steakhouse on April 3, with leaders of the state's labor unions and U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley (R) both present. The agreement dissolved the IDC to dissolve and put Stewart-Cousins in charge of the Democratic conference, with Klein as her deputy. It was set to go forward regardless of whether Felder began caucusing with Democrats or if Democrats won the April 24 special elections. [50] Following the reunification, Felder said he would continue caucusing with Republicans (giving them a one-seat majority even if Democrats won the April 24 special elections), but that he was still open to joining the new Democratic caucus. He said, “I don’t feel obligated to remain with the Republicans, or obligated to join the Democrats. I’m loyal to God, my wife and my constituents, and New Yorkers.” He also said, “I think it’s fair to say that I would have to feel a compelling reason to leave [the Republican caucus]." [50] Felder later told City and State New York , "As someone with no allegiance to either party, I’d have to be an idiot to do anything now. How do my constituents gain? There’s an election coming up in a few weeks. So, either the Republicans win and I’m 33 and it certainly doesn’t make sense for me to move at that time. Or the Democrats win both seats and we’re back to the horse trading!" [51] [52] As of April 5, the seven IDC primary challengers still planned on running against the former IDC members in September. Jessica Ramos , who planned to challenge state Sen. Jose Peralta (D), said that she did not trust that the reunification would last. [50] Alexandra Biaggi, who planned to challenge Klein, said that just because the IDC dissolved, it does not "[undo] the seven years of damage that has already occurred in New York state." Gov Cuomo said that the reunification deal prohibited incumbent state senators from backing primary challenges against other incumbents. [53] On April 9, Klein held a fundraiser for members of the IDC to help them defend themselves against primary challengers. [54] The funds went to the Senate Independence Campaign Committee, the fundraising arm of the former IDC members. [55] The IDC was officially dissolved on April 16, 2018, when the state Senate convened in session. Four IDC members who held committee chairs under Republican leadership--Marisol Alcantara (Labor), David Carlucci (Consumer Protection), Jesse Hamilton (Banks), and Tony Avella (Children and Families)--were stripped of their posts. [56] [57] On April 24, the same day the special elections for the Latimer and Diaz seats were scheduled, Felder announced that he would remain in the Republican caucus regardless of the outcome. “I believe it is my obligation to prevent an unprecedented and uncertain late-session political battle that will only hurt my constituents and New Yorkers,” he said. “Political gamesmanship must not be allowed to jeopardize the leadership, committee structure and staff of the New York State Senate and push this institution into turmoil.” [1] Democrats won both special elections on April 24, giving them a 32-31 numerical majority with Republicans still in control of the chamber through their alliance with Felder. In early May 2018, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and nine labor union leaders wrote a letter to state Senate Democratic leadership urging them to not support primary challenges against former IDC members. A spokesman for the Senate leadership said, "it has been clear for months that we are not supporting the primary opponents of our conference members." [58] At the May 2018 New York Democratic Convention, Stewart-Cousins announced that she was endorsing all state Senate incumbents, including the former IDC members. [59] On May 19, the Albany Times-Union reported that 39 IDC staffers lost their positions following the dissolution of the caucus. Of the 77 staffers who kept their jobs, 30 saw pay reductions.

[60] Background Background In 2008, Democrats took control of the New York State Senate for the first time since the 1964 elections with a 32-30 majority. They also took trifecta control of New York for the first time since the New Deal era. [61] Democrats lost control of the Senate in the summer of 2018 due to defections in their caucus but later regained control when the defecting members returned to them. [62] [61] [63] [64] [65] Republicans won a 32-30 majority in the 2010 elections and Andrew Cuomo (D) won the governorship. The Independent Democratic Caucus (IDC), a group of state Senate Democrats led by state Sen. Jeffrey Klein , broke away from the chamber's mainline Democrats the same week that Cuomo took office in early 2011. Prior to his departure from the mainline Democrats, Klein had been the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber. Following the 2012 elections, where Democrats regained a numerical majority in the chamber, the IDC entered into a power-sharing agreement with Senate Republicans where Klein and Republican leader Dean Skelos alternated as Senate president. Newly-elected Democrat Simcha Felder (D) began caucusing with the Republicans as well, although he was not part of the IDC. As part of the deal, Republican and IDC leaders were to have joint authority over bills, committee assignments, and budget negotiations. Klein also said that Republicans committed to allowing some Democratic priorities to receive a vote on the floor. After the alliance was announced, Gov. Cuomo did not call for Democratic control of the Senate, with his office saying, "The governor will withhold judgment until he sees how the Senate functions and acts on critical issues facing the state." [66] Progressives argued that the IDC-Republican alliance in the Senate prevented the state from passing healthcare, housing, and immigration policies opposed by Republican senators. Progressives also accused Gov. Cuomo of enabling the alliance in order to suit his own policy goals and political ambitions, including a possible presidential run in 2020. [67] In 2014, Klein announced that the IDC would rejoin with mainline Democrats in January 2015, citing the Republican-controlled Senate's inability to pass on the DREAM Act, increase the state's minimum wage, or allow for the public financing of elections. Gov. Cuomo, who was under pressure from the Working Families Party according to the New York Daily News , had called for the IDC to realign with the mainline Democrats and said he would campaign against them if they did not. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio both issued statements in support of the IDC realignment. [68] Republicans ended up winning an outright majority in the 2014 elections, and Klein maintained the alliance that kept them as part of the majority. He said, “I think the Independent Democratic Conference is an important, stabilizing force in the State Senate.” [69] Democrats won a 32-31 numerical majority in the 2016 elections, but the IDC and Felder again chose to align with Republicans, giving them effective control of the chamber. [70] They now partnered with Republican leader John Flanagan . Skelos stepped down in May 2015 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. The IDC-Republican power-sharing agreement again looked tenuous in November 2017, as more state and national figures began calling for the IDC members to rejoin the mainline Democrats. In May 2017, Felder wrote a letter to Klein where he called for the IDC to return to the mainline Democratic caucus. He said he would possibly rejoin the mainline Democrats if the IDC did. The IDC criticized Felder's alliance with the Republicans in response. Mainline Democratic leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and DNC Deputy Chairman and U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) also called for the IDC to return to the Democratic caucus.

Andrew Cuomo (D) did not call the special elections to fill the seats held by Latimer and Bronx Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. until April 24, even though they became empty in early January 2018. He was criticized by Democratic officials and activists for not calling the special elections sooner because the deadline to complete the state budget was March 31, 2018. [72] According to groups and observers, Cuomo delayed the special elections in order to keep the IDC-Republican Senate alliance in power during the state budget negotiations. These criticisms were not new as, according to Governing , progressives had long accused Cuomo of secretly approving of the IDC and its alliance with the GOP. [73] The editorial board of Lohud wrote the following: “ Why would Cuomo, a Democrat, hold off calling for these elections, especially since both empty Senate seats were held by Democrats and are likely to go to Democrats? It's reportedly part of a deal to get the Senate Democrats to unify. Here's the play: Cuomo delays the special election until the Fiscal Year 2019 budget is all set; then the IDC drops its power-sharing deal with the Senate GOP; the IDC aligns with the mainstream Democrats in a similar power-sharing deal, which still gives Klein a seat at the table. Also part of the reported deal is a promise that mainstream Dems won't primary those IDC members, but individual Democrats are already balking at that. It's pretty clear what the Republicans get out of the deal: Power for just a bit longer, and through the budget crafting, which is when all the important stuff gets done. The IDC retains power beforehand and keeps power after. The Democrats get to finally take power in the Senate. But what does Cuomo get out of this deal, which ensures Republicans the potential power to muffle a so-called progressive agenda for FY 2019 that the governor's been shouting about? Maybe it's the ability to say "I tried" when it comes to passing things like ethics reform, a DREAM Act and other initiatives that would bolster his progressive cred in New York but possibly cramp his nationwide draw for a presidential bid. We don't really know. But here's what we do know: New Yorkers who live in the Senate and Assembly districts that will go unrepresented during Albany's all-important budget season should be angry by Cuomo's inaction on this issue. We are. [34] Why would Cuomo, a Democrat, hold off calling for these elections, especially since both empty Senate seats were held by Democrats and are likely to go to Democrats?

Also part of the reported deal is a promise that mainstream Dems won't primary those IDC members, but individual Democrats are already balking at that. It's pretty clear what the Republicans get out of the deal: Power for just a bit longer, and through the budget crafting, which is when all the important stuff gets done. The IDC retains power beforehand and keeps power after. The Democrats get to finally take power in the Senate. But what does Cuomo get out of this deal, which ensures Republicans the potential power to muffle a so-called progressive agenda for FY 2019 that the governor's been shouting about? Maybe it's the ability to say "I tried" when it comes to passing things like ethics reform, a DREAM Act and other initiatives that would bolster his progressive cred in New York but possibly cramp his nationwide draw for a presidential bid. We don't really know. But here's what we do know: New Yorkers who live in the Senate and Assembly districts that will go unrepresented during Albany's all-important budget season should be angry by Cuomo's inaction on this issue. We are. [34] ”  In response to questions by reporters about the special election call in December 2017, Cuomo said, “There are some that want it sooner, some that want it later, there’s some who don’t. Some would argue politicizing the budget isn’t the best idea. It’s a decision that we have to make next year in January.” [75]  Special elections throughout the country Special elections throughout the country In 2018, 99 state legislative special elections were held in 26 states.

State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 2026 » « 2024 » «  2025 elections Choose a state below: New Jersey House Virginia House Submit Two of the country's 99 state legislative chambers are holding regularly-scheduled elections in 2025. Elections in those two chambers represent 180 of the country's 7,386 state legislative seats (2.4%). General elections in New Jersey and Virginia will take place on November 4, 2025 . Off-year elections in Virginia are often studied as a forecast of the broader political trends to expect from the following year's national elections. [1] The New York Times' Neil Vigdor wrote in December 2024, "In recent elections, Virginia has become a vessel for millions of dollars in spending by outside groups, and its open governor’s seat and divided legislature appears likely to continue that trend." [2] States are also holding special state legislative elections in 2025 to fill vacant seats. Click here for more .

Targeted chambers Targeted chambers DLCC targets DLCC targets The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced they would target the Virginia House in the 2025 elections : [3] “ In 2023, the DLCC helped win full legislative control in Virginia by defending the Democratic majority in the state Senate and flipping the House of Delegates blue. This year, the stakes are high as we gear up for the first major electoral test of the Trump 2.0 era. Every seat in the state House is up for reelection and Virginia voters have an opportunity to elect a Democratic trifecta.

Satellite spending Satellite spending Satellite spending describes political spending not controlled by candidates or their campaigns; that is, any political expenditures made by groups or individuals that are not directly affiliated with a candidate. This includes spending by political party committees, super PACs , trade associations, and 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups . [6] [7] [8] If available, this section includes links to online resources tracking satellite spending in this election. To notify us of a resource to add, email us . On Feb. 18, 2025, the Republican State Leadership Committee announced a six-figure Virginia ad campaign, stating: “ The RSLC PAC, in coordination with the Virginia House Republican Campaign Committee (HRCC), today launched a new digital ad exposing how Virginia House Democrats are breaking their promises to voters by pursuing an out-of-touch agenda in Richmond this legislative session. The ad will be backed by a six-figure buy on digital platforms throughout the state and highlights how Virginia House Democrats are blocking tax cuts and efforts to lower electric costs, as well as refusing to crack down on dangerous illegal immigrants. [9] [5] ” On April 7, 2025, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced a seven-figure Virginia ad campaign. DLCC Director Heather Williams said: “ Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025. [10] [5] ” Historical competitiveness data Historical competitiveness data Ballotpedia began examining the competitiveness of every state legislative race in the country in 2010. Three factors are used in this analysis: seats where the incumbent did not run for re-election, incumbents who ran in contested primaries, and seats contested by both major parties. The following table details competitiveness data collected from regularly scheduled state legislative elections between 2010 and 2023. Odd-year elections are shown grouped together first followed by even-year elections.

Election dates Election dates The following table details 2025 state legislative filing deadlines and primary dates in each state. The signature filing deadline was the date by which candidates had to file nominating signatures with election officials in order to have their names placed on the ballot. New Jersey March 24 June 10 Virginia April 3 June 17 Trifectas Trifectas State government trifecta is a term to describe single-party government, when one political party holds the governorship and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. As of April 25, 2025, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 15 Democratic trifectas,  and 12 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control. Political context Political context The 2025 cycle is the first election cycle after the 2024 presidential election . Both chambers in New Jersey and the Virginia House held elections in 2023 . Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024 From 2010 to 2024, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 14 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and two—the Minnesota House of Representatives and New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2024 elections, Democrats controlled 39 chambers and Republicans controlled 57. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House, and the Minnesota House was tied. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election. An example of this is the brief period of Democratic control in the Virginia State Senate in 2014. [11] For this chart, a red box indicates that the chamber changed from Democratic to Republican control, and a blue box indicates that the chamber changed from Republican to Democratic control.

The chart below shows the number of state legislative chambers where at least one legislative seat changed party control in each election from 1992 to 2024.  Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 A state government trifecta occurs when one political party controls the primary levers of power in a state: the governor's office, the state Senate, and the state House. From 2010 to 2018, the Republican Party increased its number of trifectas and the Democratic Party saw a decline in its trifectas. Democrats picked up six trifectas in the 2018 elections, and Republicans lost four trifectas. Following the 2021 elections, the Democratic trifecta in Virginia became a split government after Republicans gained control of the state House and governorship . After the 2023 elections, the divided government in Louisiana became a Republican trifecta when Jeff Landry (R) won election as governor. After the 2024 elections, Republicans maintained their trifectas, and two Democratic trifectas became divided governments. This chart shows the number of trifectas each party held heading into elections from 2010 to 2024, and the number of trifectas following the 2024 elections.

This tradition is rooted in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution, which states that the president "may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices." [1] The vice president and several other administrators, directors, and representatives are also part of the Cabinet. Click here for an overview of Trump's Cabinet members. The following individuals are members of Trump's Cabinet. They have either been confirmed by the U.S. Senate or hold a position that does not require Senate confirmation.   Nominees awaiting confirmation Nominees awaiting confirmation TBD , Ambassador to the United Nations  Key legislation Key legislation This section provides overviews of key federal legislation considered during the second Trump administration . To be included, the bill must have met several of the following qualifying factors: Collaboration between the president and congressional leadership on the bill Use of the reconciliation process to pass the bill Changes to the congressional procedure to pass the bill Estimated cost of the bill as evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office Extent of public relations campaign to promote the bill Domestic and international policy ramifications Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process This page provides information about budget resolutions proposed and adopted during the 119th Congress . Budget resolutions are resolutions that broadly outline spending priorities for a reconciliation bill . The Senate and the House adopting identical budget resolutions is the first step in the reconciliation process. [2] Budget reconciliation is a legislative process that can be used to override the filibuster and expedite the approval of a package of legislation in Congress that changes spending, revenues, or the debt limit. The House voted 217-215 on February 25, 2025, to adopt the initial version of the budget resolution (H.Con.Res.14) that included border, defense, and energy spending, along with tax reductions to replace the expiring tax policy from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018 . [3] There were 217 Republicans who voted in favor of the resolution, while Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and 214 Democrats voted against the resolution. [4] The Senate voted 51-48 to adopt an amended version of H.Con.Res.14 on April 5, 2025. The amended version also included a debt ceiling increase. [5] On April 10, the House voted to adopt the Senate-amended version of HCon.Res.14, completing the budget resolution process. The House voted 216-214 in favor of the resolution, with Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joining 212 Democrats in voting against the resolution. The Senate had previously voted 52-48 to approve a version of the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution (S.Con.Res.7) focused primarily on border, defense, and energy spending in February. [6] Trump's executive orders and actions  Trump's executive orders and actions As of April 24, 2025, President Donald Trump (R) had signed 139 executive orders , 37 memoranda , and 39 proclamations in his second presidential term , which began on January 20, 2025. Each type of presidential document is different in authority and implementation. Executive orders are directives the president writes to officials within the executive branch requiring them to take or stop some action related to policy or management. They are numbered, published in the Federal Register , cite the authority by which the president is making the order, and the Office of Management and Budget issues budgetary impact analyses for each order. [7] [8] Presidential memoranda and notices also include instructions directed at executive officials, but they are neither numbered nor have the same publication requirements. The Office of Management and Budget is also not required to issue a budgetary impact statement on the subject of the memoranda or notices. [9] [10] In his 2014 book, By Order of the President: The Use and Abuse of Executive Direct Action , Phillip J. Cooper, a professor of public administration at Portland State University, wrote, "As a practical matter, the memorandum is now being used as the equivalent of an executive order, but without meeting the legal requirements for an executive order." [11] Proclamations are a third type of executive directive that typically relate to private individuals or ceremonial events, such as holidays and commemorations. [9] [12] Trump has issued 139 executive orders so far during his year in office, which is the highest first-year executive order total since Harry Truman (D), who also issued 139 executive orders in 1945. Looking at his second term executive orders by topic , Trump has issued the most executive orders on foreign policy (35). Across his first and second terms, Trump has issued a total of 359 executive orders. This is the 12th-most executive orders issued by any president in U.S. history.  Click here for a complete list of Trump's executive actions. Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump (R) has not nominated any individuals to federal judgeships on Article III courts. During his first term in office, President Donald Trump (R) nominated 274 individuals to federal judgeships. Trump made 245 judicial appointments. [13] Of those appointments, 234 were Article III judges. [14] Trump withdrew eight nominees and 143 received no vote from the Senate . [15] Ballotpedia publishes the federal vacancy count report tracking vacancies, nominations, and confirmations to all United States Article III federal courts each month. In the most recent report covering activity in March 2025 , there were 43 Article III vacancies in the federal judiciary. To learn more about current vacancies in the federal judiciary, click here . The sections below group Trump's Article III judicial nominees by which step of the process they are on: confirmed by the U.S. Senate, awaiting a vote by the full Senate, awaiting a vote in committee, and awaiting a hearing before the committee. Click the arrows at the top of each table to sort by name, court, or the date of an individual's formal nomination. For a list of non-Article III nominees, click here . Confirmed to their positions Confirmed to their positions No nominees have been confirmed in the Senate. Waiting for vote in Senate Waiting for vote in Senate No nominees are awaiting a vote in the Senate. Waiting for committee vote Waiting for committee vote No nominees are awaiting a vote in committee. Waiting for committee hearing Waiting for committee hearing Note: Individuals without a date in the "first nomination" column have been announced as nominees by Trump but not yet formally nominated. No nominees are awaiting a hearing in committee. Presidential and congressional approval ratings Presidential and congressional approval ratings Multistate lawsuits against the federal government Multistate lawsuits against the federal government Multistate lawsuits are legal actions involving two or more state attorneys general. As of March 23, 2025, 11 multistate lawsuits had been filed against the second Trump administration.

Vetoed legislation Vetoed legislation This section will provide an overview of vetoed legislation during Trump's second presidential term. Tie-breaking votes cast by J.D. Vance in the U.S. Senate Tie-breaking votes cast by J.D. Vance in the U.S. Senate Vice President J.D. Vance (R) has cast one tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate . Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution , the vice president of the United States also serves as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, he or she may cast the deciding vote when there is a tie in the Senate. John Adams cast the first tie-breaking vote on July 18, 1789. As of January 24, 2025, there were 302 tie-breaking votes from 38 vice presidents. Kamala Harris (D) (2021-2025) cast the most tie-breaking votes (33) during her tenure as vice president, John C. Calhoun (1825 - 1832) cast the second most (31), and Adams (1789 - 1797) cast the third most (29). Twelve vice presidents, including Joe Biden and Dan Quayle , never cast a tie-breaking vote during their time in office.

Democrats lost supermajority status in New York and Vermont and gained it in Connecticut , while Republicans lost supermajority status in Montana and North Carolina and gained it in Iowa and South Carolina . Forty-four states held elections for at least one state legislative chamber. In total, there were veto-proof majorities in 29 state legislatures before the election—nine Democratic and 20 Republican. After the election, there were veto-proof majorities in 28 state legislatures —eight Democratic and 20 Republican. State governors may veto bills advanced by the state legislature. With sufficient support—between one-half and two-thirds of sitting legislators, depending on the state—state legislatures may overturn a gubernatorial veto. When one party controls enough seats to overturn a veto without any support from the other party, a legislature can be said to hold a veto-proof majority . These are most important when the governor belongs to the opposite party as the veto-proof legislature. Heading into the 2024 elections, four states had a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party: Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. After the elections, Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, North Carolina and Vermont lost that status, and no new state became a veto-proof legislature with an opposing party governor. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections, but neither state's legislative majority reached its supermajority threshold.

After the elections, seven had Democratic supermajorities, 18 had Republican supermajorities, and 19 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of those states before and after the elections.  Democratic 8 -1 7 Republican 18 0 18 No veto-proof majority 18 +1 19  Across all 50 state legislatures, there were nine Democratic supermajorities, 20 Republican supermajorities, and 21 states without a supermajority before the elections. After the elections, eight state legislatures had Democratic supermajorities, 20 had Republican supermajorities, and 22 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of all 50 states before and after the elections. Democratic 9 -1 8 Republican 20 0 20 No veto-proof majority 21 +1 22  The map below shows the veto-proof majority status across all 50 states after the 2024 elections.  Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities are most important when the other party controls the governorship. This creates more opportunities for legislatures to override gubernatorial vetoes. Heading into 2024, the 29 state legislatures where one party had a veto-proof majority in both chambers included four states where the governor was a member of a different political party than the veto-proof majority : Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, while North Carolina and Vermont lost it. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —had the potential to have veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Neither state acquired that status following the elections . The table below shows the status of the four states that had veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors and the two states that had the potential to acquire that status before and after the 2024 elections. Kansas Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes Kentucky Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes North Carolina Supermajority Democratic Yes No supermajority Democratic No Vermont Supermajority Republican Yes No supermajority Republican No Nevada No supermajority Republican No No supermajority Republican No Wisconsin No supermajority Democratic No No supermajority Democratic No States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Kansas and Kentucky both maintained their veto-proof status and remained Republican supermajorities with Democratic governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Vermont lost its veto-proof majority status. Before the election, Democrats in Vermont held one more than the 20 Senate seats required and seven more than the 100 House seats required for supermajority control. As of Nov. 18, Democrats won 16 Senate seats and 78 House seats, with five races uncalled. [1] North Carolina Republicans also lost their supermajority status following a key Democratic pickup in the House. [2] Republicans needed to maintain all 72 of their House seats to keep their veto-proof majority. The map below shows the states that have a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor after the 2024 elections.  States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors Ballotpedia identified two states with state legislative elections in 2024 that had the potential to gain a veto-proof majority of the party opposite the governor: Nevada and Wisconsin . Neither state became a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Nevada : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Nevada was Joe Lombardo (R). In Nevada, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Democratic Party held majorities in both chambers of the legislature that were below the threshold for a veto-proof majority. Democrats had 26-14 majority in the Nevada State Assembly (a two-thirds majority would require 28 seats) and a 13-7 majority in the Nevada State Senate (a two-thirds majority would require 14 seats). After the 2024 elections, Democrats had a 27-15 majority in the Assembly and a 13-8 majority in the Senate. Wisconsin : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Wisconsin was Tony Evers (D). In Wisconsin, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Republican Party reached the two-thirds threshold in the Wisconsin State Senate with its 22-10 majority but was short of this threshold in the Wisconsin State Assembly with its 64-35 majority. Republicans would need to control 66 Assembly seats to reach the two-thirds threshold. Republicans won 54 Assembly seats and 18 Senate seats. Accordingly, Wisconsin did not become a veto-proof supermajority with an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Summary of election outcomes Summary of election outcomes The following table includes state legislatures that gained , lost , or maintained veto-proof majority status in the 2024 elections.

There are three states — North Carolina , Vermont , and Wisconsin —that could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2022 elections. State legislatures with veto-proof majorities State legislatures with veto-proof majorities After the November 2022 elections, there were 27 state legislatures where one party held a veto-proof majority in both legislative chambers. [3] The number grew to 29 in 2023 due to legislators who switched parties . Republicans controlled twenty of the veto-proof legislatures, and Democrats controlled nine.  State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party Two of four states heading into the 2022 elections that had a veto-proof legislative majority and governor of the opposing party— Kentucky and Kansas —maintained that status after the elections. The other two states— Maryland and Massachusetts —no longer have that status since the party that held veto-proof legislative majorities also gained control of the governor's office in the 2022 elections. Vermont became a state with a veto-proof legislative majority and opposing-party governor as a result of the 2022 elections.

Some scorecards are created with a focus on specific issues, while others are broad in scope. Because scorecards can be specific to particular issues or general to a state’s legislative term, each report should be considered on its own merits. The entities that publish these reports may use different methodologies and definitions for the terms used. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. If you are aware of a scorecard Ballotpedia has not included, please email it to editor@ballotpedia.org . 2024 2024 In 2024, the New York State Legislature was in session from January 3 to June 8.

Fifty-nine of the races were in state house chambers, and five were in a state senate chamber. Click here to see a list of all the races. Of the 85 state legislative chambers that held elections in 2024, 21 (24.7%) had at least one race that was decided by fewer than 100 votes. The New Hampshire House of Representatives had 22 races decided by fewer than 100 votes—more than any other chamber. As of 2020 , there were, on average, 3,444 people in each New Hampshire House district, making them the smallest state legislative districts in the country. The Maine House of Representatives and Vermont House of Representatives each had nine races decided by fewer than 100 votes—the second-highest number after the New Hampshire House. The Maine House was also the only chamber where the number of races decided by fewer than 100 votes exceeded the total number of seats separating Democrats and Republicans following the election. In 2022 , there were two such chambers—the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Houses. In Maine, nine races were decided by fewer than 100 votes, and Democrats had a 76-73-2 majority after the election. This means that the Maine House was as close as 21 total votes away from a Republican majority. Had the two closest races won by Democrats— District 75 (decided by seven votes) and District 52 (decided by 14 votes)—been won by Republicans instead, the result would have been a 75-74-2 Republican majority. Across all 64 races, Democrats won 36 (56.3%), Republicans won 27 (42.2%), and one winner (1.6%) was unenrolled. In 2022, Democrats won 49 races by fewer than 100 votes (47.6%), Republicans won 52 (50.5%), Independents won one (1%), and one was tied. Most of the races took place in districts with small population sizes compared to the rest of the country. Forty-eight (75%) were in districts with a population of less than 25,000. Districts that size made up 26.3% of all state legislative districts as of 2020. In 2022 , there were 103 (1.64%) of the 6,278 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes. In 2020 , there were 30 (0.5%) of the 5,875 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes.

Billy Jones did not complete Ballotpedia's 2020 Candidate Connection survey. 2016 2016 Jones' campaign website highlighted the following issues: “ Retaining our Work Force This issue is imperative to sustaining and growing economic development throughout the North Country. It is becoming an ever increasing trend for young native professionals to leave the North Country to pursue their career in a geographical area that offers more opportunity for growth. In order to retain these competent young professionals and attract families from outside the North Country to our area, we need to promote a way of life that fosters good education, a safe living environment and continue to expand on businesses and cultural attractions that accommodate our residents. Attracting Tourism This issue is vital to the sustainability of retail businesses, hotels and restaurants throughout the North Country. We are very fortunate to have many inherent resources in the form of: mountains for hiking and skiing, lakes for fishing, boating and swimming, and wildlife for hunting and camping. These abundant natural resources need to be advertised in a manner to attract and increase tourism throughout the area. Bridge and Highway Infrastructure Roads and bridges are old and dilapidated with decreasing funding from state and federal sources. In order to provide a safe and secure transit infrastructure for our residents and tourists it is necessary to continually maintain the roads and bridges throughout Franklin County. It is getting increasingly challenging to secure funding from state and federal sources in order to maintain some of the old and dilapidated roads and bridges. Unfortunately, our current tax base cannot supply the funding to cover the ongoing and increasing demand for maintenance on our infrastructure that is why it is essential that we come up with a sustainable economic plan to pay for this increasing but yet necessary demand. Reducing the Tax Burden High property taxes deter residents and businesses from staying in the North Country.
The North Country needs to keep taxes to a minimum to deter residents and businesses from leaving the North Country. We need to increase economic development through tourism and agricultural businesses which in turn will increase tax revenue and help us meet challenges of rising costs throughout the North Country. We need to consolidate and limit government where it is necessary to limit the tax levy. Protecting the North Country Way of Life Hunting and activities involving fire arms in the North Country have been a recreational past time for generations and continue to be a way of life for many in our area. The recent gun laws proposed in Albany limit residents and people that come to the North Country to hunt and participate in other recreational activities involving fire arms, by restricting certain guns and ammunition clips from use. More importantly, the proposed laws infringe rights given to US citizens through the Constitution. These restrictions deter people from hunting in the North Country and consequently affect our local economy and gun dealers on what they can sell. Hunting provides a generous revenue stream to the North Country and is a highly valued recreational activity by many. We need to support gun owners’ rights by opposing laws that would infringe upon those rights and encourage the residents of the North Country and people from outside the area to utilize the inherent resources of the North Country through such recreational activities as hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities. These efforts will continue to protect the North Country way of life. [5] Retaining our Work Force This issue is imperative to sustaining and growing economic development throughout the North Country. It is becoming an ever increasing trend for young native professionals to leave the North Country to pursue their career in a geographical area that offers more opportunity for growth. In order to retain these competent young professionals and attract families from outside the North Country to our area, we need to promote a way of life that fosters good education, a safe living environment and continue to expand on businesses and cultural attractions that accommodate our residents. Attracting Tourism This issue is vital to the sustainability of retail businesses, hotels and restaurants throughout the North Country. We are very fortunate to have many inherent resources in the form of: mountains for hiking and skiing, lakes for fishing, boating and swimming, and wildlife for hunting and camping. These abundant natural resources need to be advertised in a manner to attract and increase tourism throughout the area. Bridge and Highway Infrastructure Roads and bridges are old and dilapidated with decreasing funding from state and federal sources. In order to provide a safe and secure transit infrastructure for our residents and tourists it is necessary to continually maintain the roads and bridges throughout Franklin County. It is getting increasingly challenging to secure funding from state and federal sources in order to maintain some of the old and dilapidated roads and bridges. Unfortunately, our current tax base cannot supply the funding to cover the ongoing and increasing demand for maintenance on our infrastructure that is why it is essential that we come up with a sustainable economic plan to pay for this increasing but yet necessary demand. Reducing the Tax Burden High property taxes deter residents and businesses from staying in the North Country.
The North Country needs to keep taxes to a minimum to deter residents and businesses from leaving the North Country. We need to increase economic development through tourism and agricultural businesses which in turn will increase tax revenue and help us meet challenges of rising costs throughout the North Country. We need to consolidate and limit government where it is necessary to limit the tax levy. Protecting the North Country Way of Life Hunting and activities involving fire arms in the North Country have been a recreational past time for generations and continue to be a way of life for many in our area. The recent gun laws proposed in Albany limit residents and people that come to the North Country to hunt and participate in other recreational activities involving fire arms, by restricting certain guns and ammunition clips from use. More importantly, the proposed laws infringe rights given to US citizens through the Constitution. These restrictions deter people from hunting in the North Country and consequently affect our local economy and gun dealers on what they can sell. Hunting provides a generous revenue stream to the North Country and is a highly valued recreational activity by many. We need to support gun owners’ rights by opposing laws that would infringe upon those rights and encourage the residents of the North Country and people from outside the area to utilize the inherent resources of the North Country through such recreational activities as hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities. These efforts will continue to protect the North Country way of life. [5] ” —D.

Scorecards Scorecards A scorecard evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.  To contribute to the list of New York scorecards, email suggestions to editor@ballotpedia.org .  2024 2024 In 2024, the New York State Legislature was in session from January 3 to June 8.

Elections for all 40 seats in the House took place on November 5, 2024. Ballotpedia identified elections in 15 districts as battleground elections . Members of the Alaska House formed multipartisan majority coalitions including both Democrats and Republicans after every election between 2016 and 2022. Although Republicans won a majority of seats in all four election years, the coalitions that formed after the 2016 , 2018 , and 2020 elections all included Democratic majorities, while the coalition that formed after the 2022 election included a Republican majority. The pre-election majority coalition included 20 Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent. All four majority coalitions included the members of the Bush Caucus, a group of Democratic and independent legislators representing four rural districts in Alaska's north (Districts 37 , 38 , 39 , and 40 ). Before the election, the Alaska Beacon wrote that the Bush Caucus had influenced Alaska politics for more than five decades because its members "have frequently put regional interests above those of party loyalty, and their willingness to cross the partisan aisle has frequently given them outsized power in the Capitol." [65] The minority coalition included the remaining Democrats and independents as well as Louise Stutes (R). David Eastman (R) did not caucus with either group. [66] The general election made use of ranked-choice voting , a system where voters rank the candidates on their ballot by preference order rather than being required to vote for a single candidate. Under ranked-choice voting, voters are permitted to vote for a single candidate or to rank fewer than four choices. The primaries used a top-four system where all candidates running for a given office appeared on the same ballot and the top four finishers advanced to the general election. Alaska voters approved both systems via a ballot measure in 2020. Another measure repealing the changes and returning to partisan primaries and single-vote general elections was on the 2024 ballot. Ballotpedia identified 15 of the 40 House districts as battlegrounds. Members of the Republican-led majority represented 10 battleground districts, while members of the Democratic-led minority represented the other five.

Before the election, local political observers said a multipartisan coalition including the Bush Caucus in the majority was a possible outcome. According to the Alaska Beacon , before the 2016 elections, "it was common for the Bush Caucus to join Republicans in the majority, the better to advocate for rural priorities." [67] According to the Beacon , "neither Republicans nor Democrats are in position to hold [23] seats, meaning that control of the House could come down to post-election negotiations.

At the time of the ruling, Arizona had two conflicting abortion laws—an 1864 territorial law banning abortion and a 2022 law with a 15-week ban. [70] The court ruled that the 1864 law took precedence. [70] Before the election, NPR' s Ryland Barton wrote, "Democrats are taking aim at GOP lawmakers who voted against repealing the ban.” [71] The Senate voted to repeal the law 16-14. [70] Before the election, NPR ’s Ben Giles wrote that Republicans “view immigration as a key issue here in Arizona, where voters do feel like there is a problem at the border with the number of border crossings that are happening day to day here in Arizona.” [72] NBC News ’ Adam Edelman wrote that the Republican State Leadership Committee released “ads on behalf of Republicans in three competitive districts that attacked Democrats on those issues.” [73] Ballotpedia identified seven battleground districts.

It was one of four states with a veto-proof majority of one party and a governor of another , along with Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont, with a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party . Democrats would have needed to gain three House seats or three Senate seats to block a Republican supermajority.

The outcome of the Senate elections alone could not have changed Kansas' trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the House. Before the elections, Kansas City News Service' s Zane Irwin said the partisan composition of the Legislature could have implications on the state's abortion policies. In 2022, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have prohibited the state from adding a Constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, the Legislature overrode Gov. Kelly's veto on HB2749 , which requires healthcare providers ask women questions about why they're getting an abortion. [79] Irwin also said, "[Democrats] are trying to block a flat tax. Republicans repeatedly have tried to pass a flat tax. Right now we have a multi-tiered tax system, and Republicans would like to bring it to where there's one rate that you pay in Kansas whether you are a low-income individual or are a millionaire. Republicans say that would provide broad-base tax relief at a time when our coffers are relatively flush. Democrats say that it would bring us back to a more austere era under Gov. Sam Brownback (R) where there were major tax cuts, and Democrats were worried that that would cause cuts to social services like schools and roads."

[80] There were 11 open seats in the Senate, the most since Ballotpedia began tracking this data in 2012.  Of those open districts, Ballotpedia identified two as battlegrounds. Ballotpedia also identified six battleground districts in which incumbents sought re-election. Republicans represented five of the eight total battleground districts and Democrats represented three.

Kansas House of Representatives elections See also: Kansas House of Representatives elections, 2024 All 125 seats in the Kansas House were up for election on Nov. 5, 2024. Before the election, Republicans held an  85-39 majority in the House, with one vacancy, and members were elected to two-year terms. As of 11:30 p.m. ET on November 5, 2024, Republicans had won enough districts in both chambers to maintain their legislative supermajority. [82] With more than two-thirds control in each chamber, Republicans held a veto-proof majority, giving them the power to override Gov. Laura Kelly 's (D) veto. It was one of four states with a veto-proof majority of one party and a governor of another , along with Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont, with a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party . Democrats would have needed to gain three House seats or three Senate seats to block a Republican supermajority. To maintain their supermajority, Republicans needed to lose fewer than two House seats and fewer than three Senate seats. Kansas was one of 10 states that had a divided government. The outcome of the Senate elections alone could not have changed Kansas' trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the House. 2024 was the first year since redistricting that Kansas held state legislative elections. Before the elections, Kansas City News Service' s Zane Irwin said the partisan composition of the Legislature could have implications on the state's abortion policies. In 2022, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have prohibited the state from adding a Constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, the Legislature overrode Gov. Kelly's veto on HB2749 , which requires healthcare providers ask women questions about why they're getting an abortion. [83] Irwin also said, "[Democrats] are trying to block a flat tax. Republicans repeatedly have tried to pass a flat tax. Right now we have a multi-tiered tax system, and Republicans would like to bring it to where there's one rate that you pay in Kansas whether you are a low-income individual or are a millionaire.

Missouri State Senate elections See also: Missouri State Senate elections, 2024 (August 6 Republican primaries) There were nine contested Republican primaries for the Missouri Senate on August 6, 2024. An incumbent ran  in two of those primaries, and seven of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek  re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in Districts 3, 15, 21, 23, and 27 as battleground primaries, all but two of which were for open seats. The Missouri Senate had  the most turnover since the state implemented term-limits in 2002. Of the nine members leaving the chamber in 2024, six left  due to term limits. Three of those six senators—Sen. Bill Eigel (R), Sen. Denny Hoskins (R), and Sen. Andrew Koenig (R)—were members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus. [95] Of the two other members of the Senate who formally identified as Freedom Caucus members, Sen. Rick Brattin (R) advanced from the Republican primary in District 31 , and Sen. Nick Schroer's seat was not up for election. The 2024 primaries took place  in the context of a conflict among Senate Republicans over the future of the party. According to Jonathan Shorman and Kacen Bayless of The Kansas City Star, two groups of Republican senators "have grown more divided this session after senators announced the formation of the new Freedom Caucus with backing from the national States Freedom Caucus." [96] Several Senate Republicans who were not members of the Freedom Caucus criticized the group for their use of the filibuster after the Freedom Caucus filibustered approval of the chamber's journal, a committee referral increasing threshold requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, approval of a new congressional map, and the state's budget. [97] [98] [99] Following the Caucus' January filibuster of a bill that increased requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, President Pro Tempore Caleb Rowden (R) removed four Republican senators who identified with the Freedom Caucus from their committee chairmanships. [97] In explaining why he removed caucus members from their chairmanships, Rowden criticized the caucus' filibuster efforts and said they made it too hard for the Senate to pass legislation. Rowden said, "They [filibustered] repeatedly, day after day for two weeks, basically...It became necessary for us to do something that would indicate that we’re not going to let four guys run the place; it’s just not how this works." [100] Several members of the Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Bill Eigel (R), said Republicans outside of the Freedom Caucus, including Rowden, opposed  the caucus because he believed  they tried to preserve power. Eigel said, "It’s never been about policy for them. It’s been about individuals trying to preserve power at the expense of what we believe are the issues that Republicans sent us to Jefferson City for." [101] Missouri was, at the time of the election, one of 23 states with a Republican trifecta . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature.

Joe Lombardo (R) said  the prospect of a Democratic supermajority was "a huge concern and so much of a concern that I've been proactive in identifying candidates and supporting current candidates on the Republican side of the aisle." [103] Lombardo vetoed a state record of 75 bills during the 2023 legislative session. [104] Democrats campaigned against Lombardo's vetoes, and said he vetoed legislation that voters supported. [105] Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D) said the legislative elections offered a choice between Democrats who he said "are actually trying to solve problems and make life better for Nevadans, or Republicans, who offer nothing but complaints with no real solutions to any of the challenges facing Nevadans." [106] Assemblyman Gregory Hafen (R) was critical of the prospect of a super majority saying "It makes me very nervous to have one party control because the Nevada Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to implement any new tax. So not only is the Governor’s veto at stake here, but we’re talking about any tax that could be passed with just one party control."

[133] Ballotpedia identified 25 battleground districts. Democrats represented 12 of these battleground districts and Republicans represented 13. Incumbents ran in 20 of these races, while the other five were in open districts, meaning no incumbents ran. Click here to read more about the battleground elections.  Elections for all 203 seats in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives took place on November 5, 2024. Pennsylvania was one of 44 states that held legislative elections in 2024. Democrats maintained a 102-101 majority in the state House following the election. [127] The state also remained a divided government, with a Democrat controlling the governorship and Republicans and Democrats holding majorities in the Senate and House, respectively. Democrats had gained control of the state House in 2022 . [128] Republicans had controlled the chamber since 2011. Democrats needed to lose zero seats in 2024 to retain control of the chamber. Republicans needed to gain at least one seat to gain control of the chamber. Pennsylvania was one of 10 states with a divided government at the time of the 2024 elections and the only state where the two legislative chambers were controlled by different parties. [129] According to the National Conference of State Legislatures before the elections, "if a single chamber flips in Pennsylvania and all else holds equal, there would be no states with divided legislatures for the first time since at least 1900." [129] Democrats controlled the governorship and the state House, while Republicans controlled the state Senate. If Democrats had gained control of the state Senate and maintained control of the state House in 2024, Pennsylvania's government would have become a Democratic trifecta . If Republicans had maintained control of the state Senate or gained control of the state House, Pennsylvania's government would have remained divided. A pair of resignations on July 17, 2024, left Republicans with more seats than Democrats in the chamber. However, a rule adopted in July 2023 defined the majority party as “the political party that won the greater number of elections for the 203 seats in the House of Representatives in the general election preceding the term of service that began on the first day of December next after the general election.” Because of this rule, Democrats maintained their majority. [130] Two Democrats— Andre Carroll and Keith Harris —were elected unopposed in special elections to fill the vacancies. [131] The Associated Press' Mark Scolforo wrote, "Pennsylvania’s legislative Republicans would like to pass additional voter ID requirements, restrict abortion and make election changes to improve their odds of winning judicial races. Democrats want to bump up the state’s minimum wage and widen civil rights for LGBTQ people. In the closely divided General Assembly, those proposals have gone nowhere."

[157] Scott actively campaigned with Republican challengers in person and asked voters through television and radio ads to “elect more common-sense legislators who will work with me to make Vermont more affordable.” Jason Maulucci, Scott's policy director, told The New York Times that the governor's "endorsements of lesser-known Republicans provided a 'permission slip' for Trump-averse Democrats and independents inclined to vote for change, but wary of electing MAGA candidates." [155] Ballotpedia identified four districts with a combined seven seats as battleground districts . Democrats and Republicans held three seats each in the battleground districts. The seventh seat was vacant at the time of the election. Three of the four battleground districts had at least one incumbent who did not run for re-election.

The legislature's 2024 overrides included vetoes of bills requiring state utilities to provide energy from renewable sources only by 2035, prohibiting the sale of seeds treated with certain pesticides, and increasing property taxes. [157] Scott actively campaigned with Republican challengers in person and asked voters through television and radio ads to “elect more common-sense legislators who will work with me to make Vermont more affordable.” Jason Maulucci, Scott's policy director, told The New York Times that the governor's "endorsements of lesser-known Republicans provided a 'permission slip' for Trump-averse Democrats and independents inclined to vote for change, but wary of electing MAGA candidates." [155] Ballotpedia identified four districts with a combined seven seats as battleground districts . Democrats and Republicans held three seats each in the battleground districts. The seventh seat was vacant at the time of the election. Three of the four battleground districts had at least one incumbent who did not run for re-election.

[163]   Wyoming House of Representatives elections See also: Wyoming House of Representatives elections, 2024 (August 20 Republican primaries) There were 42 contested primaries for the Wyoming House of Representatives on  August 20, 2024. An incumbent ran in 33 of those primaries, and nine of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in districts 7, 9, 24, 30, 43, 50, and 57 as battleground primaries. The primaries in districts 24 and 30 were for open seats, while incumbents faced primary challengers in districts 7, 9, 43, 50, and 57. The 2024 elections took place in the context of a conflict among House Republicans. While 57 of 62 House members were Republican, 26 voted with the Freedom Caucus, and 12 officially identified with the Freedom Caucus. [164] [165] This was a significant increase from 2017 when just five members identified with the Freedom Caucus. According to the Cowboy State Daily' s Leo Wolfson, "While Republicans have a supermajority in Wyoming, there’s a growing division between the Freedom Caucus and others in the party who say they’re too far right. Conversely, members of the Freedom Caucus have said these more centrist Republicans as being 'liberals' and couch them as adversaries who side with Democrats. There are 25-26 Republican members of the Wyoming House who are politically aligned with the Freedom Caucus. That leaves about 31 other Republicans and the five Democrats. Based on those numbers, the Freedom Caucus could gain as few as three seats to claim a majority of the Republican seats in the House. It would have to gain at least five or six seats to take a full majority." [166] According to WyoFile' s Maya Shimizu Harris, "In recent years, Republicans in Wyoming’s GOP-dominated Legislature have calcified into two distinct factions. That’s particularly the case in the House of Representatives where, last year, a group of lawmakers called the Wyoming Freedom Caucus staked their claim after partnering with a Washington, D.C.-based organization — the State Freedom Caucus Network — that aims to establish similar groups across the nation.... The partnership provides the group with a state director — Jessica Rubino, the spouse of Secretary of State Chief Policy Officer and Hageman nephew Joe Rubino — to research bills and provide vote recommendations." [164] Over the past two years, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has supported legislation to lower taxes, eliminate gun-free zones, ban abortions, ensure the state has closed primaries, and prohibit certain medical procedures for minors. [164] [167] [168] [169] [170] Because two-thirds of the chamber must approve measures for them to be included in the budget, the Freedom Caucus had sufficient numbers to block measures from being proposed in the budget. Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. John Bear (R) said the group "will not be deterred from exposing waste at all levels of government, nor the loss of our society’s moral compass by so many in the name of progress. It is what our voters sent us to Cheyenne to do." [171] [172] Freedom Caucus opponents formed a group called the Wyoming Caucus. State Rep. Clark Stith (R), a member of the Wyoming Caucus, said, "The most striking feature of the House Freedom Caucus this last session was they were voting in lockstep in accordance with text-message instructions that they would receive...The interesting effect of that is that it, to some extent, forced the remaining members of the House to become slightly more organized." Some Democratic representatives expressed alignment with the Wyoming Caucus during budget negotiations. Rep. Karlee Provenza (D) said, "Team Wyoming and the Democrats were voting on how to spend government money to benefit the people of Wyoming, knowing that some money has to be spent. The other side doesn’t think any money should be spent on anything and that churches and private organizations should save us."

According to WyoFile , the state Republican Party was, at the time of the election, "divided between traditionalist and hard-line factions," with the Wyoming Caucus representing the former and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus representing the latter. Since its founding, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus "managed to push through measures that initially appeared destined to die, such as legislation to restrict crossover voting and an abortion ban that’s now held up in court." [174] Wyoming's 2024 legislative primaries were more competitive than any in the preceding decade. There were the highest numbers of contested Republican primaries (54), Republican candidates running (141), and contested primaries involving Republican incumbents (41) than in any year since at least 2010.

[178] [179] Fifteen of those leaders (16.3%) faced contested primaries. [180] Of those, 11 were Republicans and four were Democrats. Three legislative leaders were defeated in their primaries, representing 20.0% of those who faced primaries and 3.3% of all legislative leaders seeking re-election. The 15 state legislators who faced primary challengers included three Idaho legislators as well as two each from Nevada and West Virginia. Click [show] on the table below for a table detailing the results of contested primaries involving state legislative leaders in 2024. Scott Saiki Hawaii House of Representatives Speaker d d 4.7% 254 Chuck Winder Idaho State Senate President pro tempore d d 4.6% 282 Mike Moyle Idaho House of Representatives Speaker  8.6% 799 Jason Monks Idaho House of Representatives Majority leader  34.2% 1,705 Rodric D.

One Republican served as president, one as president pro tempore , one as majority leader, and one Democrat served as speaker. Valerie Longhurst Valerie Longhurst First elected in 2003, Longhurst had served as Delaware's speaker of the House from 2023-2024. [183] Longhurst was previously the House Majority Whip from 2008-2012 and the House Majority Leader from 2012-2023. [183] Longhurst lost the Democratic primary to Kamela Smith (D) 53.3%-46.7%. During the primary, Longhurst's campaign website said, "Representative Valerie Longhurst has been diligently serving members of the 15th District since 2004 and has been instrumental in passing important, impactful legislation in various policy areas, including: mental and behavioral Health, quality public education, public safety and criminal justice reform, environment and energy, economic empowerment, health and quality of life, [and] women’s issues." [184] Delaware Online' s Shane Brennan said, "Voter turnout was consistently slow. Signs and workers representing state house representative candidates were not as common or visible as candidates for Wilmington, New Castle County and governor races." [185] [186] Smith was endorsed by the Working Families Party during the primary, and said, "Once I’m in Dover, I’ll be pushing for government transparency, better education, health care, and housing, and the investments in our people that they deserve." [187] [185] Scott Saiki Scott Saiki First elected in 1994, Saiki had served as Hawaii's speaker of the House since May 2017. Saiki was previously the House majority leader from 2013-2017. Saiki lost the Democratic primary to Kim Coco Iwamoto (D) 49.3%-44.6%. [188] During the campaign, Saiki's campaign website said, "When I think about the future for Hawaiʻi, I think about how we can create a more affordable Hawaiʻi. I believe that we need to address the root causes of why so many local families struggle: cost of living, housing that can be affordable for all, and public safety so that our ʻohana can thrive." [189] Spectrum News' Michael Tsai said local media expected a close race between Saiki and Iwamoto after the two candidates had competed against each other in the previous two election years. Tsai said, "Saiki had defeated Iwamoto by less than 200 votes in each of the last two elections...Iwamoto, an attorney and former state Board of Education member, previously fell short in races for state Senate District 13 and lieutenant governor in 2018. With her win on Saturday, she becomes the first transgender woman elected to the state Legislature." Chuck Winder Chuck Winder First elected in 2008, Winder had served as Idaho's senate president pro tempore since December 2020. [190] Winder lost the Republican primary to Josh Keyser (R) 52.3%–47.7%. Winder ran on his experience, with his campaign website quoting an editorial describing the incumbent as a "force of stability...a true conservative," saying Winder had "stepped up to oppose extremism while many others have remained silent." [191] Keyser ran as a political outsider, saying he would "offer a fresh perspective to help navigate the complex challenges we face in our beautiful state." [192] Idaho media identified Winder's opposition to the Idaho Freedom Caucus as an element in his defeat. Ahead of the 2024 legislative session, Winder removed two caucus members from committee leadership positions and disciplined a third, saying the members had posted content on social media that was defamatory to fellow legislative Republicans. Following the removal, the Republican Party of Ada County—Idaho's largest county—censured Winder. [193] In an interview with the Idaho Press , Winder said his opposition to the affiliated Idaho Freedom Foundation was a factor in his defeat. [194] Greg McCortney Greg McCortney First elected in 2016, McCortney had served as Oklahoma's senate majority leader since October 2021 and was selected earlier in 2024 to serve as president pro tempore after the 2024 elections. [195] [196] McCortney lost the Republican primary to Jonathan Wingard (R) 51.8%–48.2%. McCortney said he was running "to continue working for the things that make our area truly special things [ sic ] like our conservative values, strong schools, an improved economy, protecting our natural resources and promoting agriculture and energy." [197] Wingard ran on his military experience and values, saying he would "fight for you as a conservative, value-driven Oklahoman...It is my honor and privilege to ask you to join me as we fight the good fight of faith, freedom and rights." [198] KFOR political analyst Mike Turpen said the earlier timing of the 2024 legislative primaries as well as McCortney's business as a legislative leader were factors in the election because they left the incumbent with less time to campaign: "Everybody’s telling me this move, moving the election up a week… It cost him and others the ability to go campaign at home...And that was critical time lost on the campaign trail." [199] In an interview with KGOU , political science professor and district resident Christine Pappas said the results were a surprise: "It just kind of seemed like a regular old campaign where you expect the incumbent to win with 65%, 70% of the vote. And it was just quite shocking to see the outcome, which had Wingard narrowly beating McCortney. In fact, McCortney won no counties." [200] Craig Blair Craig Blair First elected in 2012, Blair had served as West Virginia's senate president since December 2020. [201] Blair lost the Republican primary to Tom Willis (R) 44.4%–32.2%. A third candidate, Michael Folk (R), received 23.4% of the vote. Blair ran on his experience in leadership, with his campaign website saying he "passed major reforms that led to more people working and being paid higher wages than ever before," "led the effort in the state legislature to pass the largest tax cut in history," and "passed the most pro-life legislation in state history which made abortion illegal in West Virginia." [202] Willis ran on his military experience and his involvement in the community, saying he was "the leader we need to build a better West Virginia." [203] Local media coverage discussed Blair's loss in the context of other incumbent defeats in the state senate. Blair was one of four state senators to lose a primary out of the 14 who filed for re-election in 2024. West Virginia MetroNews correspondent Brad McElhinny said Blair emphasized different policies than his two challengers: "Blair was conservative but emphasized his passion for economic development, for growth in West Virginia...The other two guys, Willis and (Mike) Folk, were much more animated by cultural issues." In an interview with MetroNews , consultant Greg Thomas said the district's demographics worked against Blair: "It’s the fastest growing part or [ sic ] the state and you have a lot of new voters which diminishes the power of the incumbency."

State legislative special elections State legislative special elections In 2024, 52 state legislative special elections were scheduled for 2024 in 22 states. Between 2011 and 2023, an average of 71 special elections took place each year. Impact of term limits Impact of term limits In 2024, 179 state legislators —77 state senators and 102 state representatives—were term-limited in 2024. This represented 3.1% of the 5,807 total seats up for election in November 2024. [205] There were fewer term-limited legislators in 2024 than in 2022 and 2020. In 2022 and 2020, there were 252 and 211 term-limited state legislators, respectively. Ballotpedia tracked the most term-limited legislators in 2010 when 375 legislators were termed out. 100 Republicans were term-limited, while 66 Democrats and 13 independents were term-limited. In even-numbered election years between 2010 and 2022, Democrats averaged about 99 term-limited legislators, while Republicans averaged 148 term-limited legislators. The Nebraska State Senate and Montana House of Representatives had the highest percentage of term-limited legislators in 2024. In the Nebraska Senate, 52% of the incumbents up for election were term-limited, while 17% of the Montana House were term-limited. Electoral competitiveness Electoral competitiveness Ballotpedia's 14th Annual State Legislative Competitiveness Report analyzed all 5,807 state legislative seats that were up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. State legislative competitiveness in 2024 was below average for even years from 2010 to 2024. In 2024, the nationwide State Legislative Competitiveness Index was 33.2 , down from the last three election cycles: 2022 (36.6), 2020 (33.4), and 2018 (36.1). State legislative competitiveness in 2024  (33.2) was below the 14-year competitiveness index average of 34.0. This average was for even-year elections only. Looking at averages across the last three even-year election cycles: 2024 had fewer open seats, incumbents in contested primaries, and seats with major competition. Key findings of this report include: 962 seats were open (16.6%) . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries (21.4%) . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 26.8% in 2022 but higher than the 20.1% in 2020. 3,583 seats were contested by both major parties (61.7%) , higher than in 2022 (59.2%) but lower than in 2018 (66.3%) and 2020 (65.2%).

Open seats Open seats There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, there were 962 open seats , guaranteeing at least 17% of all seats would be won by newcomers . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of open seats to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A greater number of open seats guarantees more newcomers entering legislatures and typically results in more candidates running for office. A smaller number of open seats guarantees fewer newcomers and typically results in fewer candidates running for office. In 2024 : There were 407 open Democratic seats , those most recently held by Democrats at the time of filing. There were 545 open Republican seats , those most recently held by Republicans at the time of filing. There were 10 other open seats . This includes those most recently held by minor party or independent officeholders at the time of filing. The total number of open seats—962—was higher than in 2020 (876), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 10% increase.

Contested primaries Contested primaries There were 5,470 state legislative districts up for election nationwide, creating 10,642 possible primaries . Of that total, there were 1,731 contested primaries , meaning 16% of all primaries were contested . This percentage is tied with 2014 (16%) as the lowest percentage of contested primaries since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 5,470 state legislative districts 10,642 possible primaries In 2024 : There were 608 contested Democratic primaries , representing 12% of all possible Democratic primaries and a 27% decrease from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 1,005 contested Republican primaries , representing 19% of all possible Republican primaries and a 14% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 118 contested top-two/four primaries , representing 40% of all possible top-two/four primaries and an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. The total number of contested primaries—1,731—was down from 2020 (1,827), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 5% decrease.

Incumbents in contested primaries Incumbents in contested primaries There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Overall, 4,853 incumbents filed for re-election and were running at the time of their respective primaries. Of that total, 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries , representing 21% of all incumbents who filed for re-election . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 27% in 2022 but higher than the 20% in 2020. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of incumbents in contested primaries to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of contested primaries indicates more opportunities for voters to elect a non-incumbent to office. A smaller number indicates fewer of those opportunities. In 2024 : There were 365 Democratic incumbents in contested primaries , representing 17% of all Democratic incumbents who filed for re-election, a 26% decrease from 2020. There were 674 Republican incumbents in contested primaries , representing 26% of all Republican incumbents who filed for re-election, a 32% increase from 2020.

Major party competition Major party competition There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, 2,224 (38%) were uncontested and had no major party competition . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 41% in 2022 but higher than the 34% and 35% in 2018 and 2020, respectively. The remaining 3,583 (62%) seats were contested by both major parties. Ballotpedia uses the level of major party competition to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of seats without major party competition indicates fewer options on the ballot. A smaller number indicates more options. In 2024 : Democrats were guaranteed to win 1,111 seats (19%) that lacked Republican competition, an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Republicans were guaranteed to win 1,109 seats (19%) that lacked Democratic competition, a 10% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Overall, Democrats ran for 4,694 seats (81%) and Republicans ran for 4,692 (81%). There were four seats guaranteed to minor party or independent candidates because no major party candidates ran. The total number of seats without major party competition—2,224—was more than in 2020 (2,044), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 9% increase. One of the two major parties was guaranteed a simple majority in 19 chambers across 14 states due to the lack of major party competition.

Margin of victory Margin of victory Across all 5,807 seats up for election, the average margin of victory was 27.3% . An electoral margin of victory (MOV) is the difference between the share of votes cast for the winning candidate and the second-place candidate in an election. Only races with more than one candidate were included in this average. The chart below displays the breakdown of races by the winner's partisan affiliation and margin of victory for each state legislative chamber with single-member districts which held elections in 2024. A darker shade of red or blue indicates a larger margin for that party. The table below displays how many seats were up for election in each chamber and how many seats each party won. It also includes a breakdown of how many seats Democrats and Republicans won by 10% or less and without opposition in each chamber, as well as the average margin of victory for each party.

Additionally, in Alaska, a bipartisan governing coalition comprised of Democrats and Republicans won control of the Alaska Senate. Republicans previously controlled all five chambers. Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023 From 2010 to 2023, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 15 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and one—the New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2023 elections, Democrats controlled 41 chambers and Republicans controlled 56. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election. An example of this is the brief period of Democratic control in the Virginia State Senate in 2014. [207] For this chart, a red box indicates that the chamber changed from Democratic to Republican control, and a blue box indicates that the chamber changed from Republican to Democratic control.

Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House members are included in each state's congressional delegation.

Delaware sent the greatest percentage of new members to the 119th Congress. Two of the three (66.7%) members of New Mexico's delegation were new members. Thirty-three states sent the same members of Congress that represented them at the end of the 118th Congress. The congressional delegations of four states became more Democratic. The party gained one member each in Alabama, Louisiana, and Oregon. The party also gained three members each in California and New York. The congressional delegations of eight states became more Republican. The party gained one member in Alaska, Colorado, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. The party also gained three members each in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

[18] Special elections throughout the country Special elections throughout the country Between 2011 and 2016, an average of 70 special elections took place each year.  A total of 25 states use special elections to fill legislative vacancies . In two other states— Illinois and Indiana —special elections are used in limited circumstances . The rest of the states fill vacancies either through appointments made by the governor of the state or by a commission made up of officials from the former member's party. In 2017, 98 state legislative seats were filled through special elections. Breakdown of 2017 special elections Breakdown of 2017 special elections In 2017, special elections for state legislative positions were held for a variety of reasons: 46 due to appointment, election, or the seeking of election to another position 1 due to an ineligible general election candidate 15 due to the incumbent accepting another job 22 due to a retirement 15 due to a death The partisan breakdown for the special elections was as follows: 46 Democratic seats 53 Republican seats Impact of special elections on partisan composition Impact of special elections on partisan composition The table below details how many seats changed parties as the result of a special election. The number on the left reflects how many vacant seats were originally held by each party, while the number on the right shows how many vacant seats each party won in the special elections. It is not typical to see significant net changes in overall state legislative party composition because of special elections. In elections between 2011 and 2016, one party (either Republicans or Democrats) saw an average net gain of three seats across the country, although actual races won and lost by each party varied more. For instance, in 2015 , Democrats lost nine seats to Republicans but won six different seats in other races, resulting in a net loss of three seats.

Similarly in politics, scorecards provide information on the status or progress of politicians and/or policy issues. They are aggregated on Ballotpedia profiles to help provide context for readers on an official’s term in office, a policy or an incumbent’s voting record. Some scorecards are created with a focus on specific issues, while others are broad in scope. On Ballotpedia, we define scorecards as those produced by newspapers, interest groups, think tanks, partisan groups, 501(c)(3)s and 501c4s that provide relative rankings and cover all state or federal  lawmakers. Because scorecards can be specific to particular issues or general to a state’s legislative term, each report should be considered on its own merits. Each entity that publishes these reports uses different methodologies and definitions for the terms used. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. We are also in the process of adding more in-depth descriptions about the reports and the scoring processes. If you are aware of a scorecard Ballotpedia has not included, please email it to editor@ballotpedia.org . What qualifies as a scorecard?  What qualifies as a scorecard? For encyclopedic purposes, Ballotpedia makes an effort to include all state scorecards (as defined below). Ballotpedia defines scorecards as those produced by newspapers, interest groups, think tanks, partisan groups, 501(c)(3)s and 501c4s that provide relative rankings and covers all state or federal lawmakers. Scorecards may also be referred to as voter guides or indexes. Scorecards: records used to measure achievement or progress. The measurement and subjects in the record vary in each publication. Voter guides: the term "voter guides" generally refers to pamphlets published and distributed by state governments just prior to an election. However, non-government groups, such as nonprofits, newspapers and interest groups, also publish guides for voters’ use. The guides may be written in an unbiased nature and present only what will appear on the ballot or they may display whether the group supports, opposes or is neutral on an issue or candidate. The latter version is similar to and can be considered a scorecard. Indexes: can refer to an alphabetical list of names, topics or items. However, it is also defined as a measure or an indicator. The term “indexes” is also used in reference to what Ballotpedia classifies as “scorecards.” Where Ballotpedia finds scorecards Where Ballotpedia finds scorecards Ballotpedia makes every effort to collect scorecards as many scorecards as possible for each state, but is limited to those scorecards that are readily available and accessible.  Research to find scorecards is conducted primarily through search engine queries, but also includes limited reference to Project Vote Smart .

[2] The act would have introduced new regulation surrounding driftnet fishing, a method of fishing involving the use of a large net that drifts on ocean currents to catch fish. The act would have expanded an existing ban on gillnets longer than 2.5 kilometers to also prohibit the use of any nets with a mesh size exceeding 14 inches. It would also have required the U.S. Department of Commerce to carry out a program assisting in a transition away from driftnet fishing during the five years before it was set to take effect. [2] In his veto message , President Trump said that the bill would put fishermen out of business and was a solution to a problem that did not exist because existing fishing management programs worked to prevent overfishing without prohibiting the use of driftnets. President Trump added that the bill would increase demand for foreign seafood that is produced in countries with fewer regulations in place to prevent overfishing. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) introduced S.906 on March 27, 2019. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) signed on as cosponsors on June 18, 2019. It passed the Senate by voice vote on July 22, 2020, and passed the House 283-105 on Dec. 10, 2020. The 283 yeas included 226 Democrats, 56 Republicans, and one independent. All 105 nay votes were Republicans. Thirty-five Republicans and six Democrats did not vote. H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 On Dec. 23, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 . [3] On December 29, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 322-87 to override Trump's veto. [12] The National Defense Authorization Act (N.D.A.A.) authorizes appropriations and sets policies for the Department of Defense on an annual basis. H.R.6395 applied to FY2021 which began on Oct. 1, 2020, and ended on Sept. 30, 2021. The N.D.A.A. does not set overall spending levels, but rather authorizes appropriations established in separate pieces of legislation. [3] In his veto message, Trump identified four provisions included in H.R.6395, with which he disagreed: [13] Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act : the Communications Decency Act was passed in 1996. Section 230 of that law guarantees websites and Internet providers protection from lawsuits over content posted or shared on those platforms by users. Trump supported the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which H.R.6395 did not contain. Trump wrote, "Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity." [13] Renamining certain military installations : H.R.6395 included a process to rename military installations named after Confederate soldiers through a National Commission on Modernizing Military Installation Designations staffed by members of Congress and military service secretaries. [3] Trump wrote, "I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles." [13] Limits on emergency military construction fund usage : H.R.6395 set a limit on how much the Defense Department could re-allocate within its budget for emergency military construction directed by the president.  In his veto message, Trump wrote, "In a time when adversaries have the means to directly attack the homeland, the President must be able to safeguard the American people without having to wait for congressional authorization." [13] Limits on troop withdrawals : H.R.6395 set limits on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea. In Afghanistan and Germany, the resolution dictated that the planned withdrawals of 2,000 and 12,000 troops from each country, respectively, be halted pending review from the Defense and State Departments. [14] In South Korea, the resolution prohibited the usage of funds to decrease troop levels in the country below 28,500. [15] Trump wrote, "Article II of the Constitution makes the President the Commander in Chief ... [T]he decision regarding how many troops to deploy and where, including in Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea, rests with him. The Congress may not arrogate this authority to itself or indirectly as purported spending restrictions." [13] Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) introduced H.R.6395 introduced the resolution on March 26, 2020. On Dec. 8, the House voted 335-78 to pass the resolution with 195 Democrats and 140 Republicans voting yea and 37 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and one Libertarian voting nay. The Senate voted 84-13 to pass the resolution on Dec. 11 with 41 Democrats, 42 Republicans, and one Independent voting yea and five Democrats, seven Republicans, and one Independent voting nay. [3] Both chambers passed H.R.6395 with more than the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability".  H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". On May 29, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". [4] The resolution was introduced to block a 2019 U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) rule related to government forgiveness of certain student loan debt. The rule changed the process students must follow to discharge their loans and empowered the D.O.E. to collect money from schools to cover financial losses following successful student challenges. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos argued in a December 2019 press release that the new rule “ensures that taxpayers who did not go to college or who faithfully paid off their student loans do not shoulder student loan costs for those who didn’t suffer harm.” [16] Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nevada) introduced the resolution on September 26, 2019. On January 16, 2020, 225 Democrats and six Republicans voted to pass the resolution in the U.S. House while 179 Republicans and Justin Amash (L-Mich.) voted nay. A version of the resolution passed the U.S. Senate on March 11 with 42 Democrats, 10 Republicans, and Angus King (I-Maine) voting to pass the resolution while 42 Republicans voted nay. In his veto message, Trump said, “Whereas the last administration promoted a regulatory environment that produced precipitous school closures and stranded students, this new rule puts the needs of students first, extends the window during which they can qualify for loan discharge, and encourages schools to provide students with opportunities to complete their educations and continue their pursuit of economic success.” [17] S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. On May 6, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. [5] The resolution was introduced in response to a January 3 airstrike ordered by the president that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Qods Force, a unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [18] [19] The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on January 9, 2020. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 55-45 vote on February 13, 2020, and the U.S. House by a 227-186 vote on March 11, 2020. The resolution prohibited the president from engaging in the use of force against Iran without prior congressional approval either in the form of a declaration of war or a specific authorization. [5] The resolution allowed the president to use military force against Iran without congressional approval only if it was in order to defend the U.S. against an imminent attack. [5] In his veto message, President Trump argued that the resolution "incorrectly implies that the military airstrike against Qassem Soleimani in Iraq was conducted without statutory authority," saying it was authorized under the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. [18] The President also said the resolution threatened to hinder the ability of the U.S. to defend itself and its allies against hostilities from Iran or other forces backed by the country.

The resolution prohibited an export license providing technical data allowing for the manufacture of the Aurora fuzing system used in the Paveway IV laser-guided bomb to Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [7] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution could "produce unintended consequences for defense procurement and interoperability with and between our partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen and endanger the lives of U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia. [20] S.J.Res.37 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of France of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution prohibited an export license related to the Paveway II laser-guided bomb to France, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [8] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened "weaken America’s global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen by weakening the capabilities of the United Arab Emirates, placing U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia at risk. [21] S.J.Res.54 - A joint resolution relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019.

The resolution was similar to H.J.Res.46 , which Trump vetoed on March 15, 2019. The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on September 10, 2019. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 54-41 vote on September 25, 2019, and the U.S. House by a 236-174 on September 27, 2019. The resolution terminated the national emergency declaration made by Trump on February 15, 2019, which directed $8.1 billion towards building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In his veto message, Trump said that the emergency declaration, "empowered my Administration’s Government-wide strategy to counter large-scale unlawful migration and to respond to corresponding humanitarian challenges ... [and] facilitated the military’s ongoing construction of virtually insurmountable physical barriers along hundreds of miles of our southern border." [22] He said, "The southern border ... continues to be a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics to come into our country," adding, "S.J. Res. 54 would undermine the Government’s ability to address this continuing national emergency." [22] S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services.

In particular, the resolution identified a manufacturing agreement under which Paveway components would be produced in Saudi Arabia. [9] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened to limit U.S. security capabilities, endanger U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia, prolong the war in Yemen, and "damage the credibility of the United States as a reliable partner by signaling that we are willing to abandon our partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing."

What is a presidential veto? Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States gives the president of the United States the ability to veto a bill passed by Congress. The president can issue a regular veto or a pocket veto. Regular veto : "The regular veto is a qualified negative veto. The President returns the unsigned legislation to the originating house of Congress within a 10 day period usually with a memorandum of disapproval or a 'veto message.' Congress can override the President’s decision if it musters the necessary two–thirds vote of each house." [28] Pocket veto : "The pocket veto is an absolute veto that cannot be overridden. The veto becomes effective when the President fails to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned and is unable to override the veto. The authority of the pocket veto is derived from the Constitution’s Article I, section 7, 'the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case, it shall not be law.'" [28] Article I, Section 7  Article I, Section 7 According to Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States, “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.

Article III does not limit when the Legislature can convene in regular session.  However, Section 18 of Article III does contain provisions related to special sessions of the Legislature.  Section 18 states that a special session can be called by a petition of request from two-thirds of both legislative houses. Since the Legislature is in session all year, a member must gavel in a session every three days. If a member does not gavel in a session, then only the governor can call the Legislature back into session.

[14] Role in state budget Role in state budget New York on New York on Check out Ballotpedia articles about policy in your state on: Budgets • Civil liberties • Education • Elections • Energy • Environment • Healthcare • Pensions New York operates on an annual budget cycle. The sequence of key events in the budget process is as follows: [15] Budget instructions are sent to state agencies between August and September . State agencies submit budget requests in October and November . Agency hearings are held between October and November . The governor submits his or her proposed budget to the New York State Legislature in mid-January . The deadline is February 1 in years following a gubernatorial election. The legislature adopts a budget in March . A simple majority is needed to pass a budget. The fiscal year begins in April . New York is one of 44 states in which the governor has line item veto authority . [15] [16] The governor is constitutionally required to submit a balanced budget. In turn, the legislature is required by statute to pass a balanced budget. [15] District maps District maps State Senate State Senate  State Assembly State Assembly  Veto overrides Veto overrides  State legislatures can override governors' vetoes. Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in New York are listed below. How many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members in both chambers. Two-thirds of members in both chambers must vote to override a veto, which is 100 of the 150 members in the New York State Assembly and 42 of the 63 members in the New York State Senate . New York is one of 36 states that requires a two-thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto. Authority: Article IV, Section 7 of the New York Constitution . "Every bill which shall have passed the senate and assembly shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the governor; if the governor approve, he or she shall sign it; but if not, he or she shall return it with his or her objections to the house in which it shall have originated, which shall enter the objections at large on the journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of the members elected to that house, it shall become a law notwithstanding the objections of the governor." Redistricting Redistricting On March 14, 2012, the state legislature approved a constitutional amendment to establish new redistricting procedures beginning in 2020. The New York Constitution requires that two successive legislatures approve an amendment in order to qualify it for final approval by popular vote. The legislature approved the amendment a second time in 2013. On November 4, 2014, voters approved the amendment, the provisions of which were set to take effect during the 2020 redistricting cycle. [17] The 10-member commission comprises the following members: [17] Two members must be appointed by the temporary president of the New York State Senate . Two members must be appointed by the speaker of the New York State Assembly . Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Senate . Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Assembly . Two members must appointed by the aforementioned eight commissioners. These two appointees cannot have been enrolled in the top two major political parties in the state. The legislature must approve the commission's plans by a simple up/down vote. The legislature must reject two separate sets of redistricting plans before it will be able to amend the commission's proposals. All districts will be required "to preserve minority rights, be equally populated, and consist of compact and contiguous territory." Further, state law will require that districts "not be drawn to discourage competition or to favor/disfavor candidates or parties." In prior redistricting cycles, authority for both congressional and state legislative redistricting was vested with the state legislature. An advisory commission participated in the process. [17] State law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and compact. State legislative districts must also take into account the "historic and traditional significance of counties." [17] 2020 2020 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State Assembly districts New York enacted new state Assembly district boundaries on April 24, 2023, when Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed legislation establishing them for use starting with the 2024 elections. [18] The bill adopting the districts passed earlier that day in the state Assembly by a vote of 132-13, and it passed the state Senate by a vote of 59-1. [19] [20] The legislation stated, "Vacancies in the Assembly will be filled using existing boundaries until January 1, 2025, at which time vacancies will be filled using the new boundaries." [21] The state redrew its Assembly district boundaries in response to a June 10, 2022, decision by the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court in Nichols v. Hochul . [22] That court upheld a lower court ruling that declared the state's Assembly district boundaries invalid but determined that they should still be used for the 2022 legislative elections since the lawsuit challenging them was filed too close to those elections for the courts to intervene. [23] The appellate division ruling determined that the Assembly district map was enacted in violation of the state's constitutional redistricting process and ordered a New York City-based state trial court to oversee the redrawing of boundaries for the 2024 elections. [23] On September 29, 2022, that trial court directed the IRC to "initiate the constitutional process for amending the assembly district map based on the 2020 census data by formulating a proposed assembly map" and submit such a plan to the legislature by April 28, 2023. [24] The New York State Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) had voted 9-1 on April 20, 2023, to advance this plan and submit it to the legislature with the Commission stating in its cover letter that the plan "garnered the highest number of votes in support" at its meeting on that date. [25] [26] According to Giulia Heyward and Jon Campbell at Gothamist , the new districts replaced "a nearly identical set of districts that were just put into place for last year’s races before a court threw them out." [27] Heyward and Campbell also wrote that "The commission had originally put forward a draft that would have made considerable changes before settling on a revised proposal last week mirroring the lines already in place." [27] Click here to view more information about Assembly districts enacted in 2023, including zoomable maps and links to detailed demographic statistics for each district.' State Senate districts On May 20, 2022, Justice Patrick McAllister ordered the adoption of a new state senate map drawn by redistricting special master Jonathan Cervas which took effect for New York's 2022 legislative elections. [28] On April 27, the New York Court of Appeals , the state's highest court, overturned a decision by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court which overturned a lower court's ruling invalidating the legislature's state Senate boundaries. [29] [30] [31] [22] Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) had signed new state legislative district boundaries into law on February 3, 2022. The New York State Senate voted 43-20 to approve them, and the New York State Assembly approved them 120-27 on the same day. [32] [33] Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie supported the new districts, saying, "I think the [commission] listened to the testimony that was given to them throughout all of the hearings across the state, and I think they came back with a fair map." [34] Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of Citizens Union, criticized the new boundaries as too similar to the ones already in place: "The new Assembly districts approved by the Independent Redistricting Commission are strikingly similar to the districts drawn by the legislature last year...This similarity suggests that the Commission drew the Assembly maps to please lawmakers." [35] Citizens Union describes itself on its website as a group "committed to reforming New York City and State government by fostering transparency, accountability, accessibility, honesty and the highest ethical standards." [36] Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Following the passage of the map, Hochul said: "These bills are necessary to reapportion districts and to provide certainty and clarity regarding such districts in a timely manner, allowing for efficient administration of the electoral process." State Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy said: "There is a wild, partisan gerrymandering that took place here. It violates the state Constitution, and we’re going to try to get justice."

The state's growth rate was at 2.19%, which was below the national rate of 9.7%. [38] Redistricting became an issue in the state prior to the November 2010 elections. Going into the elections, the organization NY Uprising asked all candidates to sign a pledge to support nonpartisan redistricting during the following legislative session. A majority of those who won in both chambers signed the pledge. [39] Additionally, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) stated his pledge to veto any new maps that were not drawn through a nonpartisan process. [40] Following a number of delays, the Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment (LATFOR) released proposed Senate and Assembly maps on January 26, 2012. The Senate plan included an additional 63rd seat. Gov. Cuomo threatened to veto the maps. [41] On March 11, LATFOR filed a bill of their final plans, which closely resembled the maps they released two months earlier. Along with this, leaders offered a constitutional amendment that would set up a new bipartisan commission on redistricting following the next census in 2020. [42] Following a walkout of Senate Democrats, the bill passed. Later that week the constitutional amendment passed. [43] With that approved, Cuomo said, "It’s over once and for all" [44] and signed the maps into law.

The New York State Senate is one of 13 state senates that was Republican for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. Across the country, there were 541 Democratic and 517 Republican state senates from 1992 to 2013.

Across the country, there were 577 Democratic and 483 Republican State Houses of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. Over the course of the 22-year study, state governments became increasingly more partisan. At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states, the most in the 22 years studied. The chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of New York , the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly from 1992 to 2013. SQLI and partisanship SQLI and partisanship The chart below depicts the partisanship of the New York state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. New York experienced a Democratic trifecta from 2009-2010. During half the years of the study, New York was ranked in the bottom-10. Its lowest ranking, finishing 43rd, occurred from 2005-2006, during a divided government. Its best ranking also occurred during a divided government, finishing 32nd in 2011.  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the New York Constitution can be amended:  I • II • III • IV • V • VI • VII • VIII • IX • X • XI • XII • XIII • XIV • XV • XVI • XVII • XVIII • XIX • XX The New York Constitution can be amended through legislatively referred constitutional amendments or through constitutional conventions . Legislature Legislature A simple majority vote is required during two successive legislative sessions for the New York State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 126 votes in the New York State Assembly and 32 votes in the New York State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention According to Section 2 of Article XIX of the New York Constitution , a question about whether to hold a state constitutional convention is to automatically appear on the state's ballot every 20 years starting in 1957. New York is one of 14 states that provides for an automatic constitutional convention question.

New York State Senate District 37 New York State Senate District 37 Assemblywoman Shelley Mayer (D) defeated former Rye Councilwoman Julie Killian (R) for the seat formerly held by state Sen. George Latimer (D). The race was originally thought to be critical in deciding the partisan control of the New York State Senate . However, after state Sen. Simcha Felder (D) announced on election day that he would continue caucusing with Republicans regardless of the outcome, the GOP was set to remain in control. With wins in District 37 and District 32 , Democrats would have had a 32-31 working majority if Felder would have joined the Democratic caucus. Before announcing his continued alliance with Republicans, he signaled that he was open to joining the Democrats and giving them control of the chamber if Mayer won.
