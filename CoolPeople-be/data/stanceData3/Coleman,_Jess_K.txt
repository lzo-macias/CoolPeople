0 0  English  Open Menu Close Menu  English  Open Menu Close Menu  English   Back Meet Jess As a lifelong Lower Manhattanite, Jess knows what makes this community special—and he knows how much is at risk. Skyrocketing rents are forcing families out. Traffic congestion is choking our streets. Vacant storefronts plague our neighborhoods. And while everyday people struggle, our leadership stands in the way of progress. Jess learned early that you don’t wait for change—you fight for it. His mother co-founded the Run for Knowledge to fund the P.S. 89 library, and his father helped rebuild the West Street baseball fields. They taught him that a strong community isn’t something you inherit—it’s something you build. From a young age, he carried that forward, coaching in the Little League, reporting for the Tribeca Trib and volunteering for his City Councilmember. After earning his law degree, he returned to Tribeca with his wife, Jessica, his cat, Oliver, and his Boston Terrier, Maxie, determined to fight for the neighborhood’s future. As co-chair of Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee, he stood up for congestion pricing, championed expanding pedestrian plazas and Open Streets, and was the board’s most vocal advocate of City of Yes, an overhaul of exclusionary zoning laws that cause skyrocketing rents. After Trump’s election, he also wrote for national publications about reviving progressive politics and fighting back against the right-wing legal movement. As a lawyer, he took on corporate giants, representing opioid crisis victims in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy—an experience that showed him just how much power is stacked against everyday people. Lower Manhattan needs a leader who will take on the fights that matter. For too long, politicians have stood by as rents soared, streets became gridlocked, and small businesses struggled to survive. Jess is running to change that. He’ll take on the housing crisis by reining in rents, expanding ownership opportunities, and investing in social housing. He’ll push for safer, more walkable streets and real action on climate change. The stakes are high, and Lower Manhattan can’t afford more of the same. It’s time for leadership that delivers. Why I'm Running Lower Manhattan is at a breaking point—rents are soaring, traffic is gridlocked, and public services are failing while politicians protect the status quo. Jess Coleman has spent his life here, fighting for safer streets, affordable housing, and stronger public spaces. Now, he’s taking on a system that puts powerful interests ahead of everyday people. It’s time for bold, no-nonsense leadership that delivers real results. DONATE $25 $175 $50 $250 $100 OTHER Our campaign relies on your support!

0 0  English  Open Menu Close Menu  English  Open Menu Close Menu  English   Back Jess’s Vision our community’s needs demand action— Jess Will Deliver: Apartments You Can Afford Housing is a right, not a luxury. But right now, sky-high rents and a lack of affordable options are pushing us out of our city. Too many families and young people feel powerless, unsure if they can afford to stay, and stuck in a cycle of anxiety. The solutions are too simple to accept excuses. Fix the Rigged Market Slash restrictive zoning laws that foster segregation and drive up rents. Increase the supply of housing to reduce landlord power and give tenants real choices. Empower Renters, Not Landlords Strengthen Good Cause Eviction, allowing tenants to challenge outrageous rent hikes. Expand cooperatives and community land trusts to give New Yorkers ownership, not just leases. Public Housing That Works Pass a Social Housing Development Authority to build permanently affordable, mixed-income housing. Fully fund NYCHA and repair crumbling public housing. Expand the Unlocked Doors pilot and reform the Third Party Transfer Program to restore neglected housing and preserve affordability. Subways and Streets that Feel Safe Nobody should feel unsafe walking in their neighborhood or riding the subway to work. Our current approach isn’t working—mental health crises go untreated while fear and disorder grow. It’s time to tackle public safety at its roots. Housing First: Address Homelessness at the Source Expand outreach teams and transition individuals into stable housing. Invest in long-term supportive housing with on-site mental health services and streamline the application process. Real Crime Prevention Crack down on repeat offenses by expanding diversion programs that connect low-level offenders to jobs and treatment instead of prison. Keep kids on the right path by funding universal after-school programs and guaranteeing summer jobs for at-risk youth. End the cycle of crime and homelessness by building thousands of supportive housing units with mental health and addiction services. Fix Our Public Spaces Tear down the scaffolding that plagues our streets through better enforcement and reforming inspection requirements. Improve lighting and maintain vibrant, welcoming public areas. Regulate app-based delivery services to manage e-bike use, reduce unnecessary trips, and prevent exploitative policies incentivizing unsafe riding. Crack Down on Hate Crimes Demand real enforcement and training to ensure that hate crimes are properly handled by law enforcement. Restore funding to the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. Clean, Vibrant, Walkable Neighborhoods Lower Manhattan is leading the city in pedestrian deaths and vacant storefronts. Our streets are gridlocked, our sidewalks are crumbling, and our small businesses are struggling. This isn’t the New York we deserve or should accept. Put People First, Not Cars Expand pedestrian plazas and Open Streets to boost foot traffic and create vibrant public spaces. Make streets safer and more comfortable for pedestrians by expanding daylighting and slow zones. Stand up to President Trump and preserve congestion pricing to cut traffic and fund better transit. Fully fund and implement the NYC Streets Plan to improve bike and bus infrastructure. Clean Up Our City Get trash bags off the sidewalks by expanding containerization citywide. Crack down on illegal placard parking by revoking placards and enforcing real accountability. Support Small Businesses Fix the flawed outdoor dining program so more restaurants can participate. Fund Our Public Spaces Fully fund the Parks Department to maintain and improve our green spaces. Create Public Space Teams to manage and maintain public spaces. Great Schools for Every Kid New York City has some of the most segregated public schools in the country. Large class sizes, underfunded programs, and admissions policies that reinforce inequality hold back our students. Every child deserves a world-class education, no matter their zip code. Fair and Transparent Admissions Standardize admissions procedures to promote diversity while giving families real choices. Invest in Our Schools Raise teacher pay to attract and retain top talent. Expand after-school programs and universal summer jobs to close the opportunity gap. Allocate more funding to reduce class sizes and comply with state law. Public Health That Puts People First Access to quality health care isn’t a privilege—it’s a right. Too many New Yorkers are stuck navigating an underfunded system, waiting weeks for appointments, or watching their local hospital close. We need real investment in public health. Mental Health Care, Not Just Policing Expand Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) beds to ensure New Yorkers in crisis can get treatment—not be sent to Rikers or the streets. Reopen and fully fund the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute to provide long-term care for those who need it most. A Fully Funded Health System Fully fund NYC Health + Hospitals, ensuring all New Yorkers—regardless of income or immigration status—have access to high-quality care. Create a Health Care Stabilization Fund to prevent hospital closures, protecting critical services in underserved neighborhoods. Investing in Prevention Expand harm reduction services and substance use treatment to prevent overdoses and keep people healthy. Improve air quality and reduce environmental health risks, tackling pollution that disproportionately harms vulnerable communities. Workers’ Rights & Strong Unions New York is a union town. However, corporate interests and weak labor laws have undermined workers’ rights, driving down wages and making it harder to organize. It’s time to rebuild worker power and ensure every New Yorker has a fair deal. Strengthen Unions, Protect Workers Defend the right to organize by cracking down on union-busting and protecting workers from retaliation. Expand project labor agreements and pass the Fair Share Act to ensure construction workers on publicly funded projects receive fair wages and benefits. Guarantee fair pay by closing loopholes that allow wage theft, raising wages for tipped workers, and enforcing prevailing wage laws. Secure Stable Jobs & Benefits Pass the Secure Jobs Act to stop unfair firings and ensure workers have real job stability. Expand paid sick and family leave so workers don’t have to choose between their job and their health. End misclassification that robs workers—especially in construction, transportation, and gig work—of their rights and benefits. LGBTQ Rights & Dignity for All New York has always been a beacon for LGBTQ rights, but too many still face discrimination, violence, and barriers to living freely. It’s time to go beyond symbolic gestures and ensure that every LGBTQ New Yorker has the support, safety, and dignity they deserve. Protect Gender-Affirming Care Prohibit city agencies from sharing information about individuals seeking gender-affirming care to protect them from harassment and out-of-state prosecutions. Expand access to gender-affirming healthcare by increasing funding for clinics and prohibiting insurance discrimination. Support LGBTQ Youth Fund and partner with nonprofits specializing in LGBTQ youth housing to combat homelessness and create safe, affirming spaces. Expand mental health services targeted to LGBTQ youth to address bullying, isolation, and suicide prevention. Support LGBTQ Seniors Establish a Commission within NYC Aging to advocate for LGBTQ seniors, ensuring access to housing, healthcare, and community support without fear of discrimination. Expand funding for LGBTQ-friendly senior centers and services to combat isolation and discrimination in elder care. A Community That Can Survive the Next Storm Lower Manhattan is on the frontlines of climate change. Rising sea levels threaten our homes and businesses, while outdated policies make us more dependent on cars, aggravating the crisis. We can’t afford half-measures—we need real action to protect our neighborhoods and cut carbon emissions. Fortify Our Communities Secure state and federal funding to complete long-overdue resiliency projects—no more delays, no more empty promises. Build infrastructure that protects Lower Manhattan from flooding and extreme weather. Cut Car Dependence, Build for the Future Encourage dense, transit-oriented development by ending zoning laws that force people into cars. Reinstate congestion pricing to cut traffic and fund subway improvements. Fix Public Transit, Fight Climate Change Fully fund the MTA’s capital plan to expand service and make transit the best option, not the last resort. Improve bus and subway reliability so more people can ditch their cars for good. DONATE $25 $175 $50 $250 $100 OTHER Our campaign relies on your support!

Jess Coleman has spent his life here, fighting for safer streets, affordable housing, and stronger public spaces. Now, he’s taking on a system that puts powerful interests ahead of everyday people. It’s time for bold, no-nonsense leadership that delivers real results. Lower Manhattan is at a breaking point OUR DISTRICT Lower Manhattan has always been a beacon of possibility. Skyscrapers poking through clouds, trains whizzing below our feet, people from all four corners of the globe brushing shoulders as they rush to work or school—there is nothing quite like it. From Independence Plaza to the Vladeck Houses, our district embodies the spirit of what can be achieved when bold ideas meet collective action. With the right leadership, Lower Manhattan can set the standard for what bold, progressive governance looks like. Jess Coleman’s vision is grounded in this belief: that our district has the potential to rise to its challenges, driven by compassion, courage, and a commitment to tangible, transformative progress. We can create neighborhoods where abundant affordable housing allows everyone to have a place they call home, where our schools provide world-class education for every child, and where our streets are vibrant public spaces that prioritize safety, accessibility, and sustainability for generations to come.
