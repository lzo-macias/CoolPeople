0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Donate *Every donation from everywhere in the US makes a BIG impact! But New Yorkers, your donation can be matched 8:1 by NYC if we hit our fundraising goal! “I want you to spend less time worrying how you can afford to stay in New York City and more time being a part of it.” Introducing Corinne Fisher At 17 years old, I arrived in New York City with the dream of becoming an artist, and the knowledge that New York City was the only place I could make that dream come true. Since that day, I co-created a groundbreaking podcast focusing on women’s issues, relationships, and mental health as well as creating and hosting a political podcast focused on critical thinking making me a top name in the industry, written a book published by HarperCollins, became an internationally recognized standup comedian, given a Tedx Talk, and led a fanbase of millions of listeners to seek a better life for themselves. And, after my Dad died, I even took over my family’s brick and mortar baseball card store for several years so I understand firsthand how challenging it is to run a small business. For the past twelve years, I have used my platform in the entertainment business to advocate for people with less reach and push for social change, now it’s time I do that and more in the dark terrain that has become politics. I’ve made my dreams come true in this city, and I’ve worked to support other New Yorkers in following their dreams, too. I’m so grateful for my experiences in volunteering and activism with nonprofits including New Alternatives for LGBTQ+ homeless youth, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Marriage Equality, Girl Scouts of the USA, PupStarz, Funny For Fido, and the Reproductive Health Access Project. But while millions of people struggled to make ends meet, career politicians were putting their ambition ahead of our communities’ needs, leaving New Yorkers less connected, less safe, and with less money in their pockets. Their every harmful policy, every selfish backroom deal, every appalling scandal pushed our dreams of making it in New York City further and further away from us. This year, we have the chance to bring them back within reach. I’m running for Mayor to give the people of this city the responsive, compassionate, efficient, and supportive City Hall we deserve. Because New Yorkers should thrive because of our city’s leaders, not despite them. Join us! We’re building a campaign across all five boroughs that celebrates the magic, electricity, and community that make NYC the best city on Earth. -Corinne Platform THE ISSUE High Cost of Living No additional fees for residents. Instead, a small tourist fee for visitors. More rent-stabilized apartments. Capped rent for small businesses. Corporations must pay employees a minimum of $20/hour. MY SIGNATURE PROGRAM : Tax breaks for New Yorkers who volunteer with one of our over 45,000 citywide nonprofits. A city that encourages community and doing good for your neighbor is a city that will THRIVE. MY SOLUTION THE ISSUE Safety The NYPD will be held to higher standards including mandatory periodic mental health checks and an enforced zero tolerance policy on racism. Being the biggest police department in the country is not something to brag about. Being the best will be. I will tackle the homelessness epidemic affecting over 100,000 New Yorkers head-on by helping them, NOT hiding them and giving residents being affected by a mental health crisis the ability to call an experienced social worker to the scene in any borough 24/7. MY SOLUTION THE ISSUE Loss of Artists/Costly to Access Art My expanded audition-based affordable artist housing will encourage the most talented people in the world to make New York City their home, and keep the culture of our city alive. Which will always be a place where immigrants and members of the LGBTQIA+ community are welcome. NYC is the country’s leader in the arts and I want to make sure it stays that way! Holding this title contributes over $100 billion to NYC’s economy, funding many programs, services, and opportunities for all New Yorkers. Increased affordable access to music and theater shows for residents in all income brackets. No more gatekeeping the arts for the wealthy. Art belongs to ALL New Yorkers. MY SOLUTION THE ISSUE Struggling Public Schools Increased salary for NYC public school teachers. People who teach in NYC should be able to afford to live here. Critical thinking programs added to the curriculum, to create a generation of children who are leaders, not followers and who are proficient in media literacy, a necessity to survive in an increasingly online world. Ensuring that every school in the NYC public school system meets the learning needs of its students. Every child in New York City should have the opportunity to achieve academic success no matter their socio-economic status, learning abilities, race, religion, or native language.
