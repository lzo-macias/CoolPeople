Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one-bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. For nearly a decade, she has worked as an organizer and activist in the district, working alongside immigrants and working families to champion affordable housing and increase access to social services. In the City Council, Jen has been a strong progressive voice, standing up to the Mayor’s proposed budget cuts to education and social services and fighting to pass legislation that would benefit working parents, including the Marshall Plan for Moms and legislation that increased free access to doulas. She is also the chair of NYC Council Technology Committee and has focused her committee work on equity. She is the daughter of immigrants and a proud lifelong public school student, graduating from New York City public schools and SUNY Albany.

Throughout my time in office I’ve stood on the side of tenants and stood against real estate interests. As Councilmember, I will continue to fight for: Expanding right to counsel to all tenants Reforming ULURP, you can see my full Land Use Policy policy here Increasing funding for NYCHA and expediting repairs Supporting rent relief programs and protections for tenants BACK TO TOP Education and Childcare As a product of New York City public schools and a new mom, I am committed to fighting for quality childcare and education for our children. This means: Enacting Universal Childcare Guaranteeing free after-school programs for all students Fully funding programs like PromiseNYC for immigrant families Ensuring that NYC schools use Culturally Responsive Education Fully funding CUNY and cap tuition increases Prioritizing investments on excluded student populations, especially English Language Learners, students with disabilities, and students in temporary housing BACK TO TOP Public Safety I envision a City that prioritizes investments to social services over increased policing, eliminating the NYPD’s most harmful programs and practices. We can start by: Significantly reducing the NYPD’s budget to invest in social infrastructure Removing police officers from schools, homeless outreach, mental health calls, and rerouting funds to services to resources the community needs, including community-based organizations dedicated to violence interruption and restorative justice practices. Significantly reducing the number of people in New York City jails and prisons, close Rikers without building new borough-based jails, and meaningful bail reform Ending arrest and prosecution of low-level offenses and clearing out low-level warrants every year, investing instead in fund diversion programs Ending all NYPD collaboration with ICE Decriminalizing sex work Increase resources devoted to monitoring, reporting, investigating, and prosecuting hate crimes, and investing in bystander training Making the CCRB disciplinary decisions binding and support the expansion of borough investigation units. BACK TO TOP TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS As the Chair of the Technology Committee without a background in tech, I have approached this role with a focus on equity and access. That means fighting for: This means: Internet for All that provides free and affordable internet for all New Yorkers The development of a concrete Internet Master Plan every 5 years Internet access and resources in our shelters Expanding Digital Literacy programs for older adults Expand technology funding in our schools Regulating NYC’s use of emerging technology like biometric surveillance and AI BACK TO TOP IMMIGRATION As the daughter of immigrants, I know how important it is for the City Council to pass legislation to support immigrant families like mine across District 34.  As a member of the Council, I am a fierce advocate for immigrants across my district and across the city. This means: Limiting ICE presence in NYC Increasing language access across all points of access in government Expanding housing vouchers to include undocumented immigrants Fighting to expedite work permits Fighting to expand municipal voting to non-citizens Ensuring incoming migrants receive proper shelter and care BACK TO TOP ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE The climate crisis is already damaging communities like our own, and North Brooklyn has a long-standing environmental justice community with deep roots in the movement against environmental racism. I hope to continue that legacy by: Bringing our energy utilities under municipal control Opposing the North Brooklyn Pipeline Advocating for flood mitigations Commiting to send zero waste to landfills by 2030 Expanding greener, transit oriented and pedestrian friendly streets and options Fighting to pass and enact a Green New Deal, and not watering down Local Law 97 BACK TO TOP TRANSPORTATION New Yorkers deserve safe streets that put the safety of people first and transportation options that work for all of us. I’ll advocate for a more livable city by: Passing Sammy’s Law and giving NYC municipal control over speed limits Prioritizing Vision Zero and fast track the Streets Plan to eliminate traffic fatalities along Broadway, Bushwick, and Myrtle Avenues Increasing infrastructure like protected bike lanes and dedicated busways Expanding the Fare Fares and Free Bus program to more New Yorkers BACK TO TOP LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ OPPORTUNITY Queer folks in our community experience disproportionate levels of poverty, violence and discrimination, and lack basic access to community building resources like education, healthcare, and housing. I will fight alongside this community to: Institute inclusive sex education Fight for funding for organizations that support LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ New Yorkers of all ages Reinforce the NYC Unity Works program Ensure equitable and gender-confirming access to health services Fund supportive housing for LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ populations BACK TO TOP ACCESS AND DISABILITY Growing up with a father who was disabled, I know first hand the difficulties that people with disabilities, and their families, face each day. Ensure all new developments have proper accommodations and upgrade older ones – without the costs shifting to tenants. Expand right to counsel for New Yorkers with disabilities Expand and improve Access a Ride, and similar transportation options Fight to make MTA stations accessible Advocated for discounted entry to cultural institutions BACK TO TOP FOOD INSECURITY As a member of a family that grew up on food stamps, I know how public assistance programs are a critical lifeline for low income homes in NYC. I am committed to advocating and expanding benefits to all New Yorkers that need them. That starts with: Advocating for an increase in EBT/SNAP individual allotments Fighting for prepared food to be covered under EBT/SNAP. Increase funding for food pantries and food gardens BACK TO TOP ANIMAL RIGHTS Fighting for a more equitable New York includes fighting for the rights and welfare of the animals that live alongside us.  I will fight for animals by: Allocating funding to maintain animal rescue organizations Requiring the teaching of humane education in New York City public schools Banning the sale of new apparel products with animal fur Prohibiting the use of horse-drawn carriages, and ensuring a just transition and training for our New Yorkers that work in this industry Advocating to fund support networks for low-income pet guardians for all cycles of life care, from veterinarians visits, to food, to end of life services.

Increase funding for food pantries and food gardens BACK TO TOP ANIMAL RIGHTS Fighting for a more equitable New York includes fighting for the rights and welfare of the animals that live alongside us.  I will fight for animals by: Allocating funding to maintain animal rescue organizations Requiring the teaching of humane education in New York City public schools Banning the sale of new apparel products with animal fur Prohibiting the use of horse-drawn carriages, and ensuring a just transition and training for our New Yorkers that work in this industry Advocating to fund support networks for low-income pet guardians for all cycles of life care, from veterinarians visits, to food, to end of life services.

NYC Resources 311 Office of the Mayor         About NYC DOT NYC Streets Plan Overview Resources Contact Us Update 2025 NYC DOT announced historic street safety and accessibility improvements under the Adams administration, including record measures to protect cyclists, safeguard pedestrians, enhance intersections, make it easier for people with low-vision to use our streets, improve bus service, and more. Press Release: NYC DOT Highlights Historic Street Safety and Accessibility Improvements Under Adams Administration Press Release: NYC DOT Highlights Historic Street Safety and Accessibility Improvements Under Adams Administration Overview The future of New York City is one where everyone has access to reliable and environmentally-friendly transportation options, as well as safe and welcoming streets and public spaces. NYC DOT developed the NYC Streets Plan , a five-year transportation plan to improve the safety, accessibility, and quality of the City’s streets for all New Yorkers. The plan involves an in-depth analysis of the current state of New York City’s streets and responds equitably to the uniqueness of the City’s many neighborhoods and local needs. In December 2019, Local Law 195 directed NYC DOT to issue and implement a transportation master plan every five  years. The law requires NYC DOT to publish an annual update on the plan. The  updates highlight new initiatives, report progress, and update maps with  finished and potential projects.

Throughout my time in office I’ve stood on the side of tenants and stood against real estate interests. As Councilmember, I will continue to fight for: Expanding right to counsel to all tenants Reforming ULURP, you can see my full Land Use Policy policy here Increasing funding for NYCHA and expediting repairs Supporting rent relief programs and protections for tenants BACK TO TOP Education and Childcare As a product of New York City public schools and a new mom, I am committed to fighting for quality childcare and education for our children. This means: Enacting Universal Childcare Guaranteeing free after-school programs for all students Fully funding programs like PromiseNYC for immigrant families Ensuring that NYC schools use Culturally Responsive Education Fully funding CUNY and cap tuition increases Prioritizing investments on excluded student populations, especially English Language Learners, students with disabilities, and students in temporary housing BACK TO TOP Public Safety I envision a City that prioritizes investments to social services over increased policing, eliminating the NYPD’s most harmful programs and practices. We can start by: Significantly reducing the NYPD’s budget to invest in social infrastructure Removing police officers from schools, homeless outreach, mental health calls, and rerouting funds to services to resources the community needs, including community-based organizations dedicated to violence interruption and restorative justice practices. Significantly reducing the number of people in New York City jails and prisons, close Rikers without building new borough-based jails, and meaningful bail reform Ending arrest and prosecution of low-level offenses and clearing out low-level warrants every year, investing instead in fund diversion programs Ending all NYPD collaboration with ICE Decriminalizing sex work Increase resources devoted to monitoring, reporting, investigating, and prosecuting hate crimes, and investing in bystander training Making the CCRB disciplinary decisions binding and support the expansion of borough investigation units. BACK TO TOP TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS As the Chair of the Technology Committee without a background in tech, I have approached this role with a focus on equity and access. That means fighting for: This means: Internet for All that provides free and affordable internet for all New Yorkers The development of a concrete Internet Master Plan every 5 years Internet access and resources in our shelters Expanding Digital Literacy programs for older adults Expand technology funding in our schools Regulating NYC’s use of emerging technology like biometric surveillance and AI BACK TO TOP IMMIGRATION As the daughter of immigrants, I know how important it is for the City Council to pass legislation to support immigrant families like mine across District 34.  As a member of the Council, I am a fierce advocate for immigrants across my district and across the city. This means: Limiting ICE presence in NYC Increasing language access across all points of access in government Expanding housing vouchers to include undocumented immigrants Fighting to expedite work permits Fighting to expand municipal voting to non-citizens Ensuring incoming migrants receive proper shelter and care BACK TO TOP ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE The climate crisis is already damaging communities like our own, and North Brooklyn has a long-standing environmental justice community with deep roots in the movement against environmental racism. I hope to continue that legacy by: Bringing our energy utilities under municipal control Opposing the North Brooklyn Pipeline Advocating for flood mitigations Commiting to send zero waste to landfills by 2030 Expanding greener, transit oriented and pedestrian friendly streets and options Fighting to pass and enact a Green New Deal, and not watering down Local Law 97 BACK TO TOP TRANSPORTATION New Yorkers deserve safe streets that put the safety of people first and transportation options that work for all of us. I’ll advocate for a more livable city by: Passing Sammy’s Law and giving NYC municipal control over speed limits Prioritizing Vision Zero and fast track the Streets Plan to eliminate traffic fatalities along Broadway, Bushwick, and Myrtle Avenues Increasing infrastructure like protected bike lanes and dedicated busways Expanding the Fare Fares and Free Bus program to more New Yorkers BACK TO TOP LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ OPPORTUNITY Queer folks in our community experience disproportionate levels of poverty, violence and discrimination, and lack basic access to community building resources like education, healthcare, and housing. I will fight alongside this community to: Institute inclusive sex education Fight for funding for organizations that support LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ New Yorkers of all ages Reinforce the NYC Unity Works program Ensure equitable and gender-confirming access to health services Fund supportive housing for LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ populations BACK TO TOP ACCESS AND DISABILITY Growing up with a father who was disabled, I know first hand the difficulties that people with disabilities, and their families, face each day. Ensure all new developments have proper accommodations and upgrade older ones – without the costs shifting to tenants. Expand right to counsel for New Yorkers with disabilities Expand and improve Access a Ride, and similar transportation options Fight to make MTA stations accessible Advocated for discounted entry to cultural institutions BACK TO TOP FOOD INSECURITY As a member of a family that grew up on food stamps, I know how public assistance programs are a critical lifeline for low income homes in NYC. I am committed to advocating and expanding benefits to all New Yorkers that need them. That starts with: Advocating for an increase in EBT/SNAP individual allotments Fighting for prepared food to be covered under EBT/SNAP. Increase funding for food pantries and food gardens BACK TO TOP ANIMAL RIGHTS Fighting for a more equitable New York includes fighting for the rights and welfare of the animals that live alongside us.  I will fight for animals by: Allocating funding to maintain animal rescue organizations Requiring the teaching of humane education in New York City public schools Banning the sale of new apparel products with animal fur Prohibiting the use of horse-drawn carriages, and ensuring a just transition and training for our New Yorkers that work in this industry Advocating to fund support networks for low-income pet guardians for all cycles of life care, from veterinarians visits, to food, to end of life services.

Jennifer tiene más de una década de estar involucrada en los asuntos y luchas de las familias de Williamsburg, Bushwick y Ridgewood - las mismas familias que desea representar. Hija de padres inmigrantes Colombianos, Jennifer nació y fue criada en Queens donde creció con su familia en un apartamento de un dormitorio en una comunidad de inmigrantes y donde atendió escuelas públicas toda su vida. Jennifer se graduó de la Universidad de Albany con una licenciatura en Letras y Ciencias Políticas. Luego trabajó con las familias de desaparecidos en Santiago de Chile antes de servir en el 2012 como directora de campo en las elecciones del Estado de Phoenix en Arizona en conjunto con los Dreamers. Desde joven, ella siempre fue una defensora. Por más de veinte años, su madre fue trabajadora doméstica, y Jennifer le acompañaba a sus sitios de trabajo para interpretar y negociar sus salarios. Cuando Jennifer tenía diez años, su papá se quedó discapacitado y Jennifer pasaba horas en el teléfono y escribiendo cartas a las compañías de seguros para garantizar que su familia siempre lograra pagar la renta. Como organizadora de la comunidad en Williamsburg, Jennifer trabajó directamente con residentes en sus derechos como inquilinos y en contra de desalojos. Fue aquí donde ella se ganó el respeto por los esfuerzos existentes para preservar los servicios críticos a la comunidad y la necesidad de asegurar vivienda accesible, justicia ambiental e igualdad educativa. Más recientemente, como Jefa de Personal para el Concejal de la Ciudad Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implementó más transparencia y acceso a los constituyentes en la forma de facilitar ocho ciclos de Presupuesto Participativo que resultaron en cinco millones de inversiones para sitios públicos como escuelas, calles, parques y NYCHA. Jennifer también ha sido fundamental en la dirección de la oficina de operaciones para servicios legislativos y electorales. Ella ha servido de enlace a la oficina en las negociaciones de la extensión para la guardería Nuestros Niños y las acciones públicas relacionadas a esta guardería y a la guardería Small World Daycare; y ha orquestado múltiples eventos comunitarios anuales. Jennifer tiene años de estar personalmente involucrada con nuestras comunidades y siempre luchará por el bienestar de todos los residentes del distrito 34.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Sobre los temas a atender Vivienda Asequible Recuperación del COVID Acceso y discapacidad Educación Justicia Ambiental Inseguridad alimentaria Seguridad Pública Transporte Derechos animales Inmigración LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ Vivienda Asequible Todos tienen el derecho a una vivienda asequible y de calidad. Yo he luchado para que nuestra comunidad tenga el derecho de autodeterminación en estos temas, y no la decisiones de desarolladores privados. Como miembro del consejo de ciudad, yo luchare por: La expansión del derecho a consejo para todo inquilinos. Reforma del ULURP Aumentar la financiación para NYCHA - vivenda publica La expansion de “Family Re-Entry Program” Aumentar los fondos para fideicomisos de tierras comunitarias y promotores sin fines de lucro para asegurar que siempre exista la vivienda accesible. Apoyar y financiar iniciativas que brinden protección y ayuda de alquileres a los inquilinos. Apoyar la planificación integral que promueva la planificación comunitaria en cada distrito comunitario. VOLVER ARRIBA Educación El sistema de educación de NYC apoya más que un millón de Nuevayorquinos cada día, y como yo misma soy una alumna de las escuelas públicas de NYC, estoy comprometida a luchar por todos los estudiantes de escuelas públicas. Esto significa: Garantizar programas extracurriculares gratis y para cada estudiante Invertir en prácticas de justicia restaurativa y quitando la presencia de policía en nuestras escuelas  con el fin de terminar el sender de la escuela a la prisión. Eliminar políticas punitivas que criminalizan la juventud. Priorizar la igualdad educativa eliminando los programas “Gifted and Talented” y los exámenes de ingreso a las escuelas secundarias especialidades. Asegurar que las escuelas públicas de la ciudad de New York utilicen la educación culturalmente diversa para enseñar a los estudiantes como respetar las diversas historias, culturas, identidades sexuales y experiencias de todos. Invertir en los servicios sociales y de salud mental en las escuelas. Priorizar las inversiones en poblaciones de estudiantes excluidos como ESL, estudiantes con discapacidades y estudiantes en viviendas temporales. Financiar a CUNY totalmente para que no haya aumentos a la matrícula. Apoyar una mayor participación de los padres de los estudiantes en el proceso de toma de decisiones significativas. VOLVER ARRIBA Seguridad Pública Me imagino una ciudad que da prioridad a las inversiones en servicios sociales sobre el aumento de fondos para la policía, eliminado los programas más dañinos de NYPD. Podemos empezar con: Reducir significativamente el presupuesto de NYPD para invertirlos en la infraestructura social. Retirar a los agentes de policía de las escuelas y las emergencias de salud mental. Usar estos fondos para apoyar servicios de organizaciones de comunidad dedicadas a la interrupción de violencia y la justicia restaurativa. Reducir significativamente el número de encarcelados en NYC, cerrando Rikers sin la construcción de nuevas cárceles, y reformar significativamente la fianza. Finalizar con los arrestos y procesamientos de ofensas de bajo nivel, la amnistía anual de órdenes de arresto e invertir en programas de desvío. Terminar la colaboración entre el NYPD y ICE. Despenalizar el trabajo sexual. Aumentar recursos dedicados a monitorear, informar, investigar y enjuiciar a los crímenes de odio y invertir en entrenamiento de espectadores. Hacer que las decisiones disciplinarias del CCRB sean vinculantes y apoyar la expansión de las unidades de investigación del municipio. VOLVER ARRIBA Inmigración Como hija de inmigrantes, reconozco la importancia que es para el Concejo Municipal aprobar legislación que apoye a las familias de inmigrantes como la mía y en todo el distrito 34. Como miembro del Concejo, seré una ferviente activista por los derechos de los inmigrantes en mi distrito y a través de toda la ciudad. Esto significa: Limitar la presencia de ICE en NYC y apoyar esfuerzos para abolir a ICE a nivel federal. Aumentar los servicios lingüísticos en todo el gobierno. Ampliar los vales de vivienda para incluir Inmigrantes indocumentadas Expandir el voto municipal que incluye a los que no son ciudadanos para que ambos tengan representación en su gobierno. VOLVER ARRIBA Recuperación justa del COVID-19 Tenemos que asegurar que las desigualdades económicas, educacionales y de salud que plagaban nuestra ciudad antes y durante esta pandemia no empeoren. Nuestra recuperación de la pandemia tiene que estar arraigada en la justicia para cada residente de Nueva York. Implementar un programa de trabajos. Financiar a más centros de salud comunitarios. Preservar y expandir el NYC Care. Luchar por un banco pública para fomentar la creación de riqueza en la comunidad y ampliar los servicios financieros accesibles y de alta calidad. Asegurar la ayuda para pequeñas empresas. Extender recursos a los neoyorquinos indocumentados que son excluidos. VOLVER ARRIBA Justicia Ambiental y Clima La crisis climática daña a comunidades como la nuestra, y North Brooklyn tiene una comunidad de justicia ambiental con raíces profundas en el movimiento contra el racismo ambiental. Quiero continuar continuar ese legado con: Poner nuestras empresas de energía bajo control municipal y re-orientarlas hacia la producción de energía renovable, incluida la oposición al gasoducto de North Brooklyn Apoyar el plan de resiliencia de los cinco condados para asegurar que la costa entera de Nueva York sea protegida Comprometer a enviar cero residuos a vertederos para el año 2030 Restaurar y financiar el programa de recolección de productos orgánicos y aplicarlo en todas comunidades de todos los distritos más allá de las “zonas piloto” Invertir en parques públicos y jardines comunitarios Expandir calles y opciones más ecológicas orientadas al tránsito y amigables para los peatones Reducir el tráfico de camiones y su contaminación para combatir las tasas de asma infantil Luchando junto a otros funcionarios electos y activistas comunitarios para aprobar y promulgar un Green New Deal VOLVER ARRIBA Transporte Los nuevayorquinos merecen calles que sean seguras para sus residentes y que también las opciones de transporte funcionen para todos. Yo defenderé una ciudad más habitable con: Priorizar “Vision Zero” e implementar mitigaciones en los pasillos de Broadway, Bushwick, y Myrtle. Expandir la infraestructura como carriles para bicicletas protegidos y vias exclusivas para autobuses Crear más zonas peatonales y hacer permanente el programa de “Open Streets” Apoyar el control municipal de MTA. Expandir el programa “Fare Fairs” VOLVER ARRIBA LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ En nuestra comunidad, las personas “queer” sufren niveles desproporcionados de pobreza, violencia, discriminación, y tambien tienen menos acceso a los recursos comunitarios como la educacion, salud, y vivienda asequible. Yo lucharé junto a esta comunidad para: Establecer educacion de sexo que sea inclusiva. Luchar por fondos para organizaciones que apoyan a neoyorquinos de todas las edades que se identifican como LGBTO+/TGNCIQ Reforzar el programa de “NYC Unity Works” que apoya a la juventud LGBTQ+/TGNCIQ  buscando trabajo. Asegurar acceso a servicios de salud que son justos y utilizan confirmación de género VOLVER ARRIBA Acceso y Discapacidad Al crecer con un padre discapacitado, yo conozco de primera mano las dificultades que enfrentan las personas con discapacidades y sus familiares todos los días Luchar para que todos los nuevos departamentos tengan las adaptaciones adecuadas y actualizar los departamentos antiguos, sin que el costo se transfiera a los inquilinos Asegurarse de que haya recursos y programas de extensión multilingües para ayudar con la inseguridad alimentaria y de vivienda y los servicios de salud Ampliar el derecho a un abogado para los neoyorquinos con discapacidades Expandir y mejorar Access a Ride y opciones de transporte similares Luchar para que el servicio de transporte público sea accesible para todas las estaciones Luchar para que la entrada a las instituciones culturales sean con descuento” VOLVER ARRIBA Inseguridad alimentaria Como miembro de una familia que creció con cupones de alimentos, los programas de asistencia pública son un sustento fundamental para los hogares de bajos ingresos en la ciudad de Nueva York. Me comprometo a defender y ampliar los beneficios a todos los neoyorquinos que los necesiten. Eso comienza con: Luchar por un aumento en las asignaciones individuales de EBT / SNAP Luchar para que la comida preparada esté cubierta por EBT / SNAP. Muchos que padecen inseguridad alimentaria también padecen inseguridad de vivienda sin acceso a cocinas Apoyar las despensas de alimentos, y trabajar dentro de la comunidad para asegurarse de que estos recursos sean accesibles Amplíe y mejore los programas de emergencia pandémica como GetFoodNYC, y ayudar a las organizaciones comunitarias más pequeñas que hayan demostrado su eficacia el último año VOLVER ARRIBA Derechos Animales Luchar por una Nueva York más equitativa incluye luchar por los derechos y el bienestar de los animales que viven junto a nosotros. Lucharé por los animales haciendo cosas como Asignar fondos para mantener las organizaciones de rescate de animales Asegurar que nuestras familias y personas sin hogar no se separen de sus mascotas en el sistema de refugio Exigir la enseñanza de la educación humana en las escuelas públicas de la ciudad de Nueva York Expandir del programa WildlifeNYC de la ciudad Prohibir la venta de nuevos productos de confección con pieles de animales Prohibir el uso de carruajes tirados por caballos y garantizar una transición justa y capacitación para nuestros neoyorquinos que trabajan en esta industria Advocar para financiar redes de apoyo para los guardianes de mascotas de bajos ingresos para todos los ciclos del cuidado de la vida, desde las visitas a los veterinarios hasta la alimentación y los servicios para el final de la vida VOLVER ARRIBA Sobre los temas a atender Vivienda Asequible Todos tienen el derecho a una vivienda asequible y de calidad.

Brannan , Julie Won , Carmen N. De La Rosa , Darlene Mealy Council Member Sponsors: 15 Summary: This bill would require the Department of Correction (DOC) to establish and operate an online scheduling system to facilitate visits to incarcerated individuals, provided that DOC shall not require the use of the online scheduling system to visit an incarcerated individual. At minimum, this online scheduling system must be accessible by mobile devices and computers, give the public the ability to request dates and times for jail visits, allow DOC to notify individuals if a scheduled visit needs to be canceled, and provide individuals with a reason if their request to schedule a visit is not approved. If an individual misses their scheduled appointment, they may complete the visit at a later time on that date where practicable. Starting January 30, 2028, the bill requires annual reporting on the number of people who used the online scheduling system to schedule a visit and were approved by DOC, the number of people who used the online system and were not approved by DOC, the number of people who visited an incarcerated individual and did not use the online scheduling system, and the number of complaints the department received regarding the online scheduling system for visits.

No. 1023-A By Council Members Gutiérrez, Louis, Nurse, Restler, Hanif, Cabán, Rivera, Williams, Banks, Farías, Sanchez, Brannan, Won, De La Rosa and Mealy A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of correction to establish and operate an online scheduling system for visits to incarcerated persons Be it enacted by the Council as follows: Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 9 of the administrative code is amended by adding a new section 9-170 to read as follows: § 9-170 Online visitation scheduling system. a. The department, in consultation with the department of information technology and telecommunications, shall establish and operate an online system for scheduling in person visits and tele-visits with incarcerated persons in the custody of the department, provided the department shall not require the use of such system to visit an incarcerated person in person at a facility of the department. Such online system shall be accessible using computers and mobile devices and shall include, but need not be limited to: 1. The ability for a person to request a date and time to visit an incarcerated person and, following approval by the department of a date and time, to reserve such date and time; 2. The ability for a person who has used such system to schedule a visit with an incarcerated person to cancel such visit; and 3. The ability for the department to notify a person who has used such system to schedule a visit with an incarcerated person that such visit must be canceled, provided that any such notification shall be made as soon as practicable after the department becomes aware of the circumstances requiring such cancellation. b. A person who has used the online system to reserve a date and time for a visit with an incarcerated person and who arrives at a facility after such time may visit such incarcerated person at a later time on such date where practicable considering factors including, but not limited to, the presence of other visitors, staff availability and compliance with applicable minimum standards of the board of correction set forth in chapter 1 of title 40 of the rules of the city of New York. c. The department shall limit access to information collected through the online system required by this section, in accordance with section 23-1202. d.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood COUNCIL MEMBER JENNIFER GUTIÉRREZ INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO EXPAND SUPPORT FOR NATURALLY OCCURRING RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES (NORCS) September 16, 2024 New York, NY — Last week, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, in partnership with Chair Crystal Hudson of the Aging Committee, introduced the Expanding Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) Act. This legislation, which will be heard on September 21st, calls for a comprehensive study to identify potential NORCs and Neighborhood NORCs in New York City and to assess the needs of older adults living in these communities. The bill mandates that the Commissioner for the Aging conduct a detailed study over a three-year period, identifying at least 20 potential NORCs and 10 Neighborhood NORCs across the city. The study will evaluate the necessary improvements and investments required to support aging in place, including access to healthcare, social services, and infrastructure enhancements. “With 1.5 million New Yorkers aged 65 and older, it’s critical that we ensure they have the resources and support needed to live independently in their communities,” said Council Member Gutiérrez . “ This legislation is a crucial step toward identifying and enhancing the infrastructure and services that will allow our older residents to age in place with dignity.” “Over the next fifteen years our city will undergo an immense demographic shift, experiencing a 40% increase in its older adult population. By 2040, nearly 1 in 5 New Yorkers will be an older adult. The steps we take to support our older neighbors today will help us prepare for tomorrow’s aging population and are critical to guaranteeing the wellbeing of all New Yorkers as we enter our golden years. This legislation is a significant and necessary step toward achieving a goal that will ensure we are all afforded the opportunity to age in place in the communities we call home with the dignity and care we all deserve,” said Council Member Crystal Hudson, Chair of the Committee on Aging. Currently, there are only 37 recognized NORCs in New York City, and the process to establish them is slow and complex. This bill aims to streamline that process and provide a clear path to support for more communities. The findings of the study will inform the development and implementation of a plan to improve services and infrastructure for older adults in identified NORCs, ensuring that they have the necessary resources to thrive in their communities.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood CITY COUNCIL TO PASS LANDMARK LEGISLATION AIMED AT EXPANDING SUPPORT FOR OLDER ADULTS December 4, 2024 NYC is projected to see a 40% increase in the older adult population by 2040, only 37 NORCs exist to serve current population of 1.5M older adults New York City, NY (December 4, 2024) — The New York City Council is poised to pass the Expanding Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) Act ( Intro 1022 ), a groundbreaking initiative designed to support the city’s growing older adult population at tomorrow’s Stated Meeting. With over 1.5 million New Yorkers aged 65 and older, this legislation addresses the critical need for community-based resources that allow seniors to age in place with dignity. The Expanding NORCs Act, introduced by Council Member Gutiérrez and Chair of the Committee on Aging, Crystal Hudson,  establishes a comprehensive three-year study to identify and support NORCs, aiming to expand the city’s current 37 recognized NORCs to at least 20 additional communities. By conducting detailed demographic and service accessibility assessments, the study will develop targeted support plans, address existing capital needs, and provide training for community organizations that assist older adults. Currently, a NORC designation requires a nonprofit organization with independent funding to manage and support it. This system has left many neighborhoods without NORC services due to the lack of stable nonprofit infrastructure. The Expanding NORCs Act seeks to close this gap, ensuring that more communities can access the resources needed to support their aging populations. “This act represents a critical step in ensuring our older New Yorkers can age with dignity and independence,” said Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, who introduced the bill. “ We’re not just creating a policy; we’re building a support system for our most vulnerable residents. I’m thankful for the leadership and partnership of Chair Hudson in advancing her comprehensive Aging in Place plan, and I’m honored that this bill is a key component of it.” “While our city is projected to see a 40% increase in its older adult population over the coming decades, we have not yet scaled up the resources necessary to help aging New Yorkers age in place,” said Council Member Crystal Hudson, Chair of the Committee on Aging. “Int. 1022 will ensure the city has a clear plan for Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), which will also grow as our population ages. NORCs and Neighborhood NORCs provide essential on-site services to residents, meeting them where they are. This plan will allow us to identify emerging NORCs and assess their needs, supporting our broader goal of helping older adults age in place across all five boroughs.” “We applaud Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez for her leadership on this bill and her dedication to our city’s older adults. New York’s older adult population is growing rapidly, and the overwhelming majority of older New Yorkers want to age in place in the communities they call home. This bill is a critical step toward making that a reality by identifying and investing in NORCs, which are already home to so many older adults. By assessing their needs and ensuring the right supports and infrastructure are in place, we can enable older adults to age with dignity, independence, and connection. Older New Yorkers helped build our city and make it great, and they deserve to age in place in the communities they love,” said Beth Finkel, State Director of AARP New York. “As a North Brooklyn community-based organization that provides essential services in the community to ensure that older adults can age in place, St. Nicks Alliance supports the passage of the NORCs bill, Int 1022 so that New York City can better understand the impact of NORC services and expand them to where they are most needed”, stated Amy Berg, Deputy Executive Director of Social Services, St. Nicks Alliance. With a projected 40% increase in the older adult population by 2040, this legislation represents a forward-thinking approach to addressing New York City’s changing demographics and ensuring that aging residents have the resources they need to thrive. ### Posted in Aging , Community , Senior | Tagged AGING , community , District 34 , nyc , seniorcare , Seniors CITY COUNCIL TO PASS LANDMARK LEGISLATION AIMED AT EXPANDING SUPPORT FOR OLDER ADULTS December 4, 2024 NYC is projected to see a 40% increase in the older adult population by 2040, only 37 NORCs exist to serve current population of 1.5M older adults New York City, NY (December 4, 2024) — The New York City Council is poised to pass the Expanding Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) Act ( Intro 1022 ), a groundbreaking initiative designed to support the city’s growing older adult population at tomorrow’s Stated Meeting. With over 1.5 million New Yorkers aged 65 and older, this legislation addresses the critical need for community-based resources that allow seniors to age in place with dignity. The Expanding NORCs Act, introduced by Council Member Gutiérrez and Chair of the Committee on Aging, Crystal Hudson,  establishes a comprehensive three-year study to identify and support NORCs, aiming to expand the city’s current 37 recognized NORCs to at least 20 additional communities. By conducting detailed demographic and service accessibility assessments, the study will develop targeted support plans, address existing capital needs, and provide training for community organizations that assist older adults. Currently, a NORC designation requires a nonprofit organization with independent funding to manage and support it. This system has left many neighborhoods without NORC services due to the lack of stable nonprofit infrastructure. The Expanding NORCs Act seeks to close this gap, ensuring that more communities can access the resources needed to support their aging populations. “This act represents a critical step in ensuring our older New Yorkers can age with dignity and independence,” said Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, who introduced the bill. “ We’re not just creating a policy; we’re building a support system for our most vulnerable residents. I’m thankful for the leadership and partnership of Chair Hudson in advancing her comprehensive Aging in Place plan, and I’m honored that this bill is a key component of it.” “While our city is projected to see a 40% increase in its older adult population over the coming decades, we have not yet scaled up the resources necessary to help aging New Yorkers age in place,” said Council Member Crystal Hudson, Chair of the Committee on Aging. “Int. 1022 will ensure the city has a clear plan for Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), which will also grow as our population ages. NORCs and Neighborhood NORCs provide essential on-site services to residents, meeting them where they are. This plan will allow us to identify emerging NORCs and assess their needs, supporting our broader goal of helping older adults age in place across all five boroughs.” “We applaud Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez for her leadership on this bill and her dedication to our city’s older adults.

The study would identify potential NORCs and N-NORCs, assess the needs of older adults, evaluate necessary improvements, and collect data on demographic trends and health outcomes. Within two years of completing the study, the Commissioner would be required to develop and implement a plan to support aging in place within these communities. This plan would include recommendations for officially designating identified communities, resource estimates for supportive service programs, training for community-based organizations, infrastructure improvements, and the establishment of a program to provide grant funding and other resources to support the operations of community-based organizations to provide services within such identified communities.

Over a 3-year period beginning on the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall conduct a study on naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities in the city. Such study shall include, but need not be limited to: 1. Information on the existing state of naturally occurring retirement communities, including their locations, supportive services provided at each such location, and contact information for buildings and service providers; 2. Identifications of potential naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities as both such communities are defined in section 209 of the elder law, not currently designated or otherwise recognized by the New York state office for the aging or the department, accompanied by explanations of how and why each such potential community was identified; 3. In consultation with relevant council members and community stakeholders, information on the existing capacity of community-based organizations to support each such potential community; 4.

A summary of the needs assessments and challenges expressed by current naturally occurring retirement community providers, including any identified capital needs within such communities; 6. Data on the demographic trends, health outcomes, and social isolation among older adults in such communities; and 7. In consultation with the department of city planning, the department of health and mental hygiene, the department of transportation, and any other agency deemed necessary, an evaluation of the necessary improvements and investments required to enhance neighborhood infrastructure, healthcare facilities, social services, transportation, and other critical services to support older adults aging in place within such communities. d. Plan regarding naturally occurring retirement communities. Based on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the commissioner shall, within 2 years of completing such study, develop and implement a plan to support naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities. The plan shall include, but need not be limited to: 1. Recommendations to the New York state office for the aging to designate any housing developments, buildings, or areas identified in the study conducted pursuant to subdivision c of this section as naturally occurring retirement communities or neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities, as appropriate; 2. An estimate of the resources needed to establish and maintain supportive service programs within such potential communities, disaggregated by each such potential community; 3. Training and onboarding for community-based organizations to expand their capacity to support older adults in such potential communities; 4. Recommendations for infrastructure improvements for such potential communities to be shared with the cabinet for older New Yorkers as established by section 2405 of the New York city charter; 5. Strategies to improve the identification of naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities throughout the city, taking into consideration communities that lack appropriate or relevant service providers; and 6. Subject to appropriation, a program to provide grant funding and other resources, including start-up grants, capacity-building support, and operational funding to support the operations of community-based organizations to provide services within identified naturally occurring retirement communities. e. The commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council, and post on the department’s website, the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision c of this section and the plan developed pursuant to subdivision d of this section. f.

The study would identify potential NORCs and N-NORCs, assess the needs of older adults, evaluate necessary improvements, and collect data on demographic trends and health outcomes. Within two years of completing the study, the Commissioner would be required to develop and implement a plan to support aging in place within these communities. This plan would include recommendations for officially designating identified communities, resource estimates for supportive service programs, training for community-based organizations, infrastructure improvements, and the establishment of a program to provide grant funding and other resources to support the operations of community-based organizations to provide services within such identified communities.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts.

Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood COUNCIL MEMBER JENNIFER GUTIÉRREZ INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO REESTABLISH INTERNET MASTER PLAN & BRING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET TO ALL NEW YORKERS November 14, 2024 NYC hasn’t had comprehensive plan to increase internet access since Mayor Adams killed popular plan in 2022 New York (November 14, 2024) – Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, Chair of the Committee on Technology, will introduce legislation next week at the November 21st, 2024, Stated meeting aimed at reviving the transformative Internet Master Plan, a blueprint to provide universal, affordable, and equitable broadband access to all New Yorkers. Originally launched in 2020, the Internet Master Plan set out to give broadband access to the over 1.5 million New Yorkers who lack reliable internet. Despite initial success and broad support from community and government stakeholders, Mayor Eric Adams discontinued the program in 2022 in favor of the more limited Big Apple Connect initiative. This inaction from Mayor Adams sparked strong criticism from digital equity advocates, community groups, and members of the City Council’s technology committee, who argued that Big Apple Connect does not address the full scope of New York’s digital divide. Council Member Gutierrez’s new bill, co-sponsored by 14 Council Members, directs the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) to resume and implement the core strategies of the Internet Master Plan, which include: Setting measurable goals for providing affordable broadband in underserved neighborhoods; Leveraging city assets and public-private partnerships to expand a shared fiber infrastructure; Prioritizing participation from minority- and women-owned internet providers to ensure equity in digital services; Guaranteeing broadband access in all city-owned facilities, including public housing. “The Internet Master Plan was a bold and visionary approach to closing New York City’s digital divide and make sure 1.5 million more New Yorkers are connected to the services and community they need to thrive,” said Council Member Gutierrez . “Discontinuing it left countless families without access to essential connectivity, and no path forward in site. This legislation will put New York City back on track to achieve true digital equity. After what we went through in 2020, with remote schooling, remote programming from senior centers, and increases in remote work, making sure every single New Yorker has high-speed internet access is a matter of life and death.” The timing of this legislation is particularly crucial following the discontinuation of the federal Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) earlier this year, which provided internet subsidies to over 2 million New York City residents. While the Big Apple Connect program currently serves some NYCHA residents, it lacks a sustainable funding model beyond its initial three-year period and leaves many low-income communities without coverage. ### Posted in Tech | Tagged Committee on Technology , internet , internetmasterplan , nyc , OTI , Tech COUNCIL MEMBER JENNIFER GUTIÉRREZ INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO REESTABLISH INTERNET MASTER PLAN & BRING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET TO ALL NEW YORKERS November 14, 2024 NYC hasn’t had comprehensive plan to increase internet access since Mayor Adams killed popular plan in 2022 New York (November 14, 2024) – Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, Chair of the Committee on Technology, will introduce legislation next week at the November 21st, 2024, Stated meeting aimed at reviving the transformative Internet Master Plan, a blueprint to provide universal, affordable, and equitable broadband access to all New Yorkers.

Last name: Brannan E-mail: AskJB@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/justin-brannan/ Notes: District 47 - Council Member - Democrat - Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach - Council Member Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a record salesman and early childhood educator. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism at Fordham, before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – traveling to over fifty countries across five continents.  While working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor Council Member Gentile and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Education where he helped oversee the expansion of Universal Pre-K.  A longtime believer in the importance of making government work efficiently to create opportunities for working and middle class families, Brannan was elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn’s 43rd Council District. With too many people feeling that government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Council Member Brannan has vowed to always fight for the “little guy.”  The 43rd Council District might be far from the soaring skyscrapers and posh penthouses that many associate with New York City, but Brannan knows that his district is the backbone of the City and deserves the same respect, resources and results as everyone else. As Council Member, he’s made it his mission to make life just a little bit easier for everyone who calls the 43rd District their home.  Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his wife Leigh, an artist, educator, and small business owner.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University. District 45 - Council Member - Democrat - Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, Kensington - Farah N. Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.

Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.  Shahana attended PS 230 in Kensington and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies at Brooklyn College. She lives in Kensington with her cat, Babe.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.  Lincoln grew up in Brooklyn Heights and lives in Greenpoint with his partner. He graduated from Brown University and attended neighborhood schools.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

For more than a decade, she has worked for the well-being of working families, women, seniors, and the youth of New York City Council District 41. Her passion for the people of her district is displayed through her focus on legislation that reflects core community values which include: equality, fairness and non-discrimination in the workplace.  Local Law 33 of 2015, authored by Council Member Mealy, entrusted the NYC Commission on Human Rights with pursuing employment discrimination investigations. This law ensured that constituents seeking jobs across the city truly have a fair shot during the job application process. In conjunction with Local Law 33, Mealy also authored Local Law 29 of 2015, which ensures that the Commission on Human Rights regularly reports its work combating unlawful discriminatory practices.  As the former Chair of the Committee on Contracts, Mealy used her power over the City’s annual multi-billion dollar contracting budget to lift up Minority and Women-owned Businesses (MWBEs). She contributed to the passing of Local Law 1 of 2013, a pivotal MWBE legislation that helped underpin the MWBE program that the city still offers today. Her leadership has been prominent in later New York State and City Council legislation that adjusted procurement rules to allow for MWBEs to have real pathways to secure government contracts. Focusing on the challenges MWBEs has face ensures that small businesses across New York City, and in District 41, realize opportunities to secure the stability and growth that a city contract secures.  Using her expertise in navigating the city’s departments, Council Member Mealy secured a roster of results for her community. From Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of Buildings to the Department for the Aging and the Department of Youth and Community Development, Mealy has worked directly with the alphabet soup of City agencies that make decisions that impact daily lives of local constituents. The number of community resources that include the placements of senior programs, community workshops, funding for community-based organizations have all benefitted from her guidance and experience.  Council Member Mealy is truly BACK and BETTER THAN EVER.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

Amanda is a lifelong Bronxite, born and raised in Soundview as a second-generation Afro-Latina of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent. She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours learning to dance and summers at camp in Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. Soon after graduate school, she started her career by fighting voter suppression and mobilizing Black and Latino communities for President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus and a districtwide Participatory Budgeting process. After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx. Amanda’s programming and partnerships with CUNY, labor unions, and local community-based organizations have allowed her to create new opportunities for young Bronxites to access trade jobs. During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Amanda created a pipeline for more women to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.  During the height of the pandemic Amanda became active in mutual aid and feels most in her element when in community. Hosting food distributions for neighbors has been at the core of her service to continue the fight against food insecurity and The Bronx being the unhealthiest county in NYS.  She was elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021. Amanda currently resides in Parkchester with her dog and cat.

Introduction The New York State Social Services Law and Family Court Act require that when a foster care placement changes, a social services agency or worker must provide the attorney for the child with notice of the change in placement. This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to conduct annual audits of foster care placement notifications. The audit would include a review of instances in which a notice was not provided as required, the time elapsed between a change in foster care placement and when the placement notice was provided, whether each notice included the information required by law, and a summary of the information that was missing from the notice. ACS would be required to report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and post on the ACS website, a report with the results of its audit from the preceding year.

Introduction This bill would require the Department of Correction (DOC) to establish and operate an online scheduling system to facilitate visits to incarcerated individuals, provided that DOC shall not require the use of the online scheduling system to visit an incarcerated individual. At minimum, this online scheduling system must be accessible by mobile devices and computers, give the public the ability to request dates and times for jail visits, allow DOC to notify individuals if a scheduled visit needs to be canceled, and provide individuals with a reason if their request to schedule a visit is not approved. If an individual misses their scheduled appointment, they may complete the visit at a later time on that date where practicable. Starting January 30, 2028, the bill requires annual reporting on the number of people who used the online scheduling system to schedule a visit and were approved by DOC, the number of people who used the online system and were not approved by DOC, the number of people who visited an incarcerated individual and did not use the online scheduling system, and the number of complaints the department received regarding the online scheduling system for visits.

Among other things, information in these reports would include the number of people in custody who have been ordered to undergo a forensic psychiatric examination, the housing area type where these individuals are being detained, and the average length of time a person deemed unfit to stand trial spends in custody before being discharged to an appropriate institution for competency restoration.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother. For nearly a decade, Sandy has been working in Bushwick and supporting projects in East New York that empower women and young people of color. Most of her work has been dedicated to ending white supremacy, fighting for a transition away from the fossil fuel economy, and demanding our public agencies and servants are accountable to the people, not corporations.  Through years of strong community partnerships and collaborations, Sandy has built neighborhood institutions that directly strengthen grassroots movements in Bushwick and East New York. She has committed her life to addressing issues through direct interventions and solutions including building farms in our food deserts, creating jobs where we have high unemployment, and helping develop community space where it was scarce.  As the new City Council Member, she will fight to keep people in their homes, create protections for our immigrant neighbors, and help to build a healthy, sustainable future.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood Biography Jennifer Gutiérrez is an organizer, activist, and ally. For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families that she now represents. Born and raised in Queens, to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one-bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science. An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education. As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events. Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all. Follow her on Twitter and Instagram. Biography Jennifer Gutiérrez is an organizer, activist, and ally.

Real estate speculation, rising rents, loss of rent-stabilized housing, and new developments with out-of-reach “affordable housing” have left families that have called Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Ridgewood home for decades with no other option than to pack up and relocate. The district is also home to a historic industrial business zone, with long-standing manufacturing businesses that provide good-paying and local jobs to thousands of New Yorkers, which are being pushed out by nonindustrial uses such as nightlife venues, tech office developments, last mile warehouses, and self-storage facilities. Small businesses that have been central to the community are priced out by rising rents, only to be replaced by vacant storefronts. As your City Council Member, I am working to ensure that future development in the district is inclusive and balanced, with truly affordable housing, preservation of our industrial sector, community-serving uses, and opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship that are open to all. This document serves as a guide for any future rezoning and construction in District 34, grounded in an understanding that we will only consider equitable developments that strengthen the existing community. We expect developers and city agencies to work collaboratively with us and the local community to craft proposals that are reflective of these values and principles prior to commencing the formal ULURP review process.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood Manufacturing Coalition In January of 2023, the “M-Zone Coalition” was formed by a collection of Council Members, Borough Presidents, business advocates, and community leaders who recognized the importance of New York’s industrial sector. Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, who represents the third-largest industrial business zone (IBZ) in the city, organized and led this coalition in response to the Adams Administration’s announcement of introducing the text amendment Zoning for Economic Opportunity (ZEO) as part of his City of Yes initiatives . He aimed to enhance economic activity by removing outdated zoning restrictions and improving conditions for local businesses and commercial districts in NYC. It was the M-Zone coalition who recognized the need to address New York’s industrial sector, crucial for daily functions in our city. They organized efforts to persuade the Department of City Planning to include provisions on manufacturing zoning and infrastructure that would promote renovation and advancement. Replacing existing 1961 “M” districts with new “M” districts is instrumental in safeguarding and fostering core industrial sectors, as it establishes a new framework for land use in industrial areas. On June 6th, 2024, the M-Zone coalition succeeded. The City Council approved the text amendment, creating three new zoning areas for manufacturing, one of which is a core industrial area that prohibits non-industrial uses. Additionally, the city agreed to work on a text amendment to establish a special permit requirement for Last Mile warehouses, aimed at regulating the over-concentration and community impacts of large warehouses operated by e-commerce giants like Amazon within city limits. These efforts were led by Council Member Alea Aviles. The text amendments are a positive starting point for developing land-use tools that address the challenges of the changing industrial landscape, foster green energy initiatives, and support a thriving, equitable city. These hard fought wins are supported by the Industrial Development Strategic Plan that the city council passed in 2023, signaling a comprehensive commitment to revitalizing the manufacturing sector. Local Law 172 of 2023 will require a citywide Industrial Development Strategic Plan to support industrial development, expand and retain industrial businesses and jobs, and ensure coordinated planning for city infrastructure and green energy needs and the efficiency and resiliency of chains for essential goods and services. This plan is required to be completed in 2025 and will also help inform future neighborhood planning and land use actions to apply the new “M” zoning districts created by this text amendment. New York City is also currently working on the Industrial Development Strategic Plan , which was approved by the City Council last year. Take the survey today: https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/nyc-industrial-plan/nyc-industrial-plan-overview.page NEW “M” DISTRICT FRAMEWORK: Three types of zoning areas specifically tailored to manufacturing needs. Core Industrial District: Prioritizes the preservation of essential industrial businesses and restricts non-industrial uses. There is currently no appropriate zoning tool to facilitate expansion of heavy industrial uses in IBZs. A new zoning tool should: Allow for increased density where appropriate to support industrial activities (3 or 4 FAR). Ensure the availability of essential industrial land for core industrial uses: Limit retail and office uses to small sizes/ accessory to industrial. Restrict entertainment and night-life. Right-size parking and loading requirements. Mixed/Transition District: Supports an active and sustained mix of industrial and commercial uses. Office and retail uses have lower overhead (and lower wages!) and can often pay higher rent than industrial uses, which generate greater economic value. New zoning tools can foster a dynamic mix of industrial and commercial activity: Allow for increased density, with a dedicated industrial set-aside. Monitor and expand incentives for industrial space like the Industrial Business Incentive Area (IBIA) special permit. Require ground floor industrial uses in certain conditions. Right-size parking and loading requirements. Growth District: Encourages the development of new loft-style buildings in areas closest to transit and residential communities. Allow for flexible growth of industrial and commercial businesses (including office, retail, and nightlife/entertainment), right-size parking and loading requirements, and encourage development of new loft-style buildings in IBZ areas closest to transit and residential uses. Currently, the ZEO text amendment would create ONLY this district – the most flexible district with the fewest protections for industrial uses. We support the creation of this district ONLY if the Core Industrial and Mixed/ Transition districts are also created. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? New York City’s industrial sector impacts our economy and the people who contribute to and benefit from it — which is all of us.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard. What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 34 Jennifer Gutiérrez Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bushwick (West), Bushwick (East), Ridgewood Universal Child Care Universal Childcare has been one of the key priorities for Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez since she took office. She is the prime sponsor with Council Member Kevin Riley of the Universal Childcare bill in the New York City Council. The journey to create universal child care infrastructure began with extensive research in 2022, involving discussions with over 20 organizations and 5+ municipalities worldwide. This laid the groundwork for the drafting phase from September 2022 to February 2023, during which multiple drafts were developed with central staff and feedback from various groups. By March 2023, the legislation was introduced with significant press coverage and a rally. The momentum continued from April to June 2023 as the UCC coalition focused on specific childcare-related wins in the FY24 budget. The summer of 2023 was dedicated to building coalition and preparing for a September hearing, which served as a platform to highlight the key concerns facing parents and caregivers. The legislation was reintroduced in early 2024 – and we successfully used the coalition to secure meaningful budget wins in the face of cuts to the childcare industry from Mayor Adams. During those budget fights, over 15 major labor organizations signed onto a letter urging the mayor to invest in childcare funding. We are continuing to build out coalition but hosting more roundtables across the city with different industries. Get involved: Fill out this form to stay in the loop!

The journey to create universal child care infrastructure began with extensive research in 2022, involving discussions with over 20 organizations and 5+ municipalities worldwide. This laid the groundwork for the drafting phase from September 2022 to February 2023, during which multiple drafts were developed with central staff and feedback from various groups. By March 2023, the legislation was introduced with significant press coverage and a rally. The momentum continued from April to June 2023 as the UCC coalition focused on specific childcare-related wins in the FY24 budget. The summer of 2023 was dedicated to building coalition and preparing for a September hearing, which served as a platform to highlight the key concerns facing parents and caregivers. The legislation was reintroduced in early 2024 – and we successfully used the coalition to secure meaningful budget wins in the face of cuts to the childcare industry from Mayor Adams. During those budget fights, over 15 major labor organizations signed onto a letter urging the mayor to invest in childcare funding. We are continuing to build out coalition but hosting more roundtables across the city with different industries. Get involved: Fill out this form to stay in the loop!

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

Oversight Not available Not available Int 0408-2024 * Public Advocate Jumaane Williams Creating a division within the department of small business services to assist street vendors and requiring the commissioner of small business services to update the department’s programs to facilitate street vendor access. Introduction This bill would create a Division of Street Vendor Assistance within the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to assist street vendors. The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors. Further, the Commissioner would be required to annually submit to the Speaker and the Mayor, and publish on the SBS website, a report on the updating of SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations and a report on the Division’s assistance of street vendors. Not available Not available Int 0431-2024 * Pierina Ana Sanchez Ensuring business licensing and regulatory compliance of all mobile food and general vendors. Introduction This bill would increase the number of food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses available each year for five years, and then it would lift the cap on food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses. This bill would also expand training to include information related to the particular vending restrictions of the license holder. Not available Not available Int 1164-2025 * Joann Ariola Requiring an interagency portal to track street vending enforcement. Introduction This bill would require the Office of Street Vendor Enforcement (OSVE) to create a portal that would allow all agencies enforcing street vending laws and regulations to share enforcement-related information. OSVE would also ensure that each enforcing agency has the capability to verify the authenticity of vendor licenses. Not available Not available Int 1251-2025 * Amanda Farías Issuing supervisory licenses to mobile food vendors. Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The report would recommend a design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with city requirements. The agency would also post a comprehensive online map of all public bathrooms in the City.

Last name: Bottcher E-mail: District3@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/erik-bottcher/ Notes: District 3 - Council Member  - Democrat ~ Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Greenwich Village, West SoHo, Hudson Square, Times Square, Garment District, Flatiron, Upper West Side - Erik Bottcher is a dedicated public servant and activist who has devoted his life to progressive causes and to the betterment of the community he loves. In 2021, he was elected to represent City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Flatiron, Hudson Square, Times Square, the Theater District, the Garment District and Columbus Circle.  Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality.  Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaision in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage.  In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Erik has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more.  When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik built an expansive volunteer network in his community that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors, and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments, and organized weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.  Erik believes that our government should be effective, innovative, inclusive, and that it must work for the people, not special interests. Erik knows that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead.

Prior to his election to the Council in November 2021, Carr served as Chief of Staff to Minority Leader Matteo for the previous eight years. As a focal point of the Mid-Island Council office, Carr managed a broad range of issues from constituent and community matters, to moving legislation in City Hall. In less than seven years, he helped negotiate the passage of 27 of Matteo’s bills, which is a record for a Staten Island Council Member. He also worked closely with many community organizations and city agencies to help the Council member allocate funding and capital resources.  Carr has had a lifelong passion for government and politics and began getting involved in campaigns at the age of 10, stuffing mailings and doing literature drops for Guy Molinari’s final run for Borough President. He continued to be involved in races over the years and decided to dedicate his professional life to bettering his community through political action. After being staff on campaigns for two years, Carr began working in government doing constituent services in the United States House of Representatives. He eventually became the Chief of Staff to then-newly elected state Assemblyman, and current City Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli before taking that role for Matteo in 2014.  Carr has also been an active member of the Staten Island Republican Party’s County Committee (SIGOP) since 2009 and its Executive Committee since 2012. He is a former President of the Richmond County Young Republicans and First Vice-Chair of the SIGOP.  A lifelong resident of Grasmere, Carr attended St. Christopher’s Preschool, P.S. 48 in Concord, and the former St. John Villa Academy for elementary and middle school and Monsignor Farrell High School. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Government from Georgetown University.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Last name: Riley E-mail: District12@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-12/ Notes: District 12 - Council Member - Democrat  - Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Co-op City - New York City - Kevin Christopher Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York.  While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal.  Prior to being elected to represent the New York City Council’s 12th district, Kevin worked for the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Carl E. Heastie.  For over a decade, he worked directly with community groups and organizations as well as pertinent leaders across New York City. This is where his passion was born, this is where he gained the courage to run for City Council.  Kevin has been no stranger to hard work or mentorship. Not only has he had mentors throughout his career, he has also dedicated his down time to generating positive relationships with the youth. Working for the New York Foundling as a Skills Coach is where he witnessed how much mentorship can impact your growth and overall confidence. As a skills coach, he mentored young men, educating them on life skills and making them cognizant of their social surroundings. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s, My Brother’s Keeper initiative.  In 2019, he founded a non-profit organization, Music Over Violence, which seeks to address violence and social injustice within his community. Another endeavor undertaken by Kevin, in conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers, is the founding of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives.

Last name: Last name: Riley Riley E-mail: E-mail: District12@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-12/ Notes: Notes: District 12 - Council Member - Democrat  - Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Co-op City - New York City - Kevin Christopher Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York.  While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal.  Prior to being elected to represent the New York City Council’s 12th district, Kevin worked for the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Carl E. Heastie.  For over a decade, he worked directly with community groups and organizations as well as pertinent leaders across New York City. This is where his passion was born, this is where he gained the courage to run for City Council.  Kevin has been no stranger to hard work or mentorship. Not only has he had mentors throughout his career, he has also dedicated his down time to generating positive relationships with the youth. Working for the New York Foundling as a Skills Coach is where he witnessed how much mentorship can impact your growth and overall confidence. As a skills coach, he mentored young men, educating them on life skills and making them cognizant of their social surroundings. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s, My Brother’s Keeper initiative.  In 2019, he founded a non-profit organization, Music Over Violence, which seeks to address violence and social injustice within his community. Another endeavor undertaken by Kevin, in conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers, is the founding of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson.

Rita C.  Last name: Last name: Joseph Joseph E-mail: E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene.

She organized voting rights information sessions, led strategy workshops to address gang policing and created annual youth forums and community celebrations to bridge relationships between residents and neighborhood partners. Each step of the way, Althea’s natural leadership and organizing skills were honed while advocating for families, seniors, young adults and students on important issues, while identifying and allocating much needed resources to neighborhoods of the Bronx.  Althea will continue her life’s work – of motivating and inspiring, leading with passion and advocating for the community – as a proud member of the City Council representing the great residents of City Council District 16.

She is a passionate community activist, connector, and advocate for crucial issues such as public safety, equitable education, housing and senior services.  Raised in Baipu, a town in Eastern China, Susan was born into a family that ran a small business and was raised by her grandparents who were school teachers. She later came to the United States in 2008 as an international student with nothing but two suitcases in pursuit of the American Dream. Susan earned her bacholer degree in Finance from the State Universty of New York at Oswego and later an MBA from University of Southern Indiana.  Upon graduating SUNY Oswego, Susan moved to New York City to work in the private sector for few years. During that time, she volunteered at the Office of New York State Assemblyman William Colton and leveraged her background in finance to help senior citizens and small businesses file tax returns. It is this first-hand experience that provided her with the unique perspective and understanding of issues concerning seniors and small business owners.  Driven by her passion for public service, Susan joined Assemblyman Colton’s Office as Chief of Staff in 2014. Since then, Susan has worked tirelessly on many pressing issues facing the diverse communities of Bensonhurst, Gravesend, Dyker Heights, and Sunset Park. From fighting for public safety, advocating for social justice, and protecting small businesses – to defending fair access to public education and social services – Susan puts under-represented families at the forefront of her advocacy.  In addition to her formal public service experiences, Susan has organized numerous community protests, meetings, and hearings as an activist and volunteer. Susan is also an active member of Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association and has dedicated herself to voter education efforts, youth leadership development, and civic engagement activities.  As a first-generation immigrant, an Asian-American, a working wife, a mother of two young children, and a proud New Yorker, Susan is committed to continuing her journey of working side-by-side with her neighbors to solve their problems and create positive change in this post-pandemic era. In her capacity as a Council Member representing the newly-formed 43rd District, Susan will focus on pressing community issues such as:  Public Safety. Susan is determined to do whatever it takes to fight against hatred and racism to ensure a safe and secure Southern Brooklyn for all residents.  Quality Education. Susan aspires to promote a public education system that benefits those who value education and strive to pursue it.  Affordable Housing. Susan is committed to developing more affordable housing for Southern Brooklyn residents and their families.?
Support for Small Business. Susan strives to help small businesses by cutting through the red tape and providing regulatory support and compliance assistance.  Senior Services. Susan aims to support the senior community by mobilizing more resources and connecting them with the youth in Southern Brooklyn.

She is a passionate community activist, connector, and advocate for crucial issues such as public safety, equitable education, housing and senior services.  Raised in Baipu, a town in Eastern China, Susan was born into a family that ran a small business and was raised by her grandparents who were school teachers. She later came to the United States in 2008 as an international student with nothing but two suitcases in pursuit of the American Dream. Susan earned her bacholer degree in Finance from the State Universty of New York at Oswego and later an MBA from University of Southern Indiana.  Upon graduating SUNY Oswego, Susan moved to New York City to work in the private sector for few years. During that time, she volunteered at the Office of New York State Assemblyman William Colton and leveraged her background in finance to help senior citizens and small businesses file tax returns. It is this first-hand experience that provided her with the unique perspective and understanding of issues concerning seniors and small business owners.  Driven by her passion for public service, Susan joined Assemblyman Colton’s Office as Chief of Staff in 2014. Since then, Susan has worked tirelessly on many pressing issues facing the diverse communities of Bensonhurst, Gravesend, Dyker Heights, and Sunset Park. From fighting for public safety, advocating for social justice, and protecting small businesses – to defending fair access to public education and social services – Susan puts under-represented families at the forefront of her advocacy.  In addition to her formal public service experiences, Susan has organized numerous community protests, meetings, and hearings as an activist and volunteer. Susan is also an active member of Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association and has dedicated herself to voter education efforts, youth leadership development, and civic engagement activities.  As a first-generation immigrant, an Asian-American, a working wife, a mother of two young children, and a proud New Yorker, Susan is committed to continuing her journey of working side-by-side with her neighbors to solve their problems and create positive change in this post-pandemic era. In her capacity as a Council Member representing the newly-formed 43rd District, Susan will focus on pressing community issues such as:  Public Safety. Susan is determined to do whatever it takes to fight against hatred and racism to ensure a safe and secure Southern Brooklyn for all residents.  Quality Education.

He represented tenants and neighborhood coalitions in fair housing litigation and anti-displacement advocacy in some of the most gentrified neighborhoods in NYC. Shekar began his legal career with the landmark Broadway Triangle fair housing struggle against the City of New York, a successful case challenging a rezoning under the Fair Housing Act.

Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two small children, who can often be seen biking or scooting up and down the open 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

Mercedes’ commitment to family and community is based on a strong set of values passed on to her by her immigrant parents. Uniquely qualified and specially prepared, Mercedes has sought to bring all people – regardless of class, racial background, economic status, sexual orientation or social position into what she calls “the Family of People.”  As an advocate for her community, Mercedes has tirelessly worked to empower her neighborhood holistically. In order to excel on all levels, Mercedes works to support all families in our community, helping them understand how local government can work for them, and what they can do together to improve the quality of lives of all.  For decades, much of Mercedes focus has been connecting with different groups of young people, encouraging them to get involves by giving back to her community as young leaders in various aspects. Most recently she has partnered with young people at marches for social justice, census outreach, and food and facemask giveaways during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, Mercedes has fiercely worked to improve the quality of healthcare and its delivery, not only in Brooklyn, but overseas as well. Most recently, Mercedes is worked as a re-entry nurse at Paul J. Cooper Center for Human Services, Inc. where she provides, and addresses outpatient chemical dependency treatment for adult alcohol & drug abusers. She has also served as the general administrator of two different private clinics, MJC & Brooklyn Gastro.  Mercedes is a consensus builder and has worked and partnered with a number of local elected leaders to bring much-needed resources to the district. Mercedes well-rounded personality lends itself to community leadership, and public service.  Mercedes Narcisse has been recognized and honored by many organizations and associations for her long record and history of outstanding community service. In 2008, she was the sole recipient of the “Corporate Award” presented by the New York State Association of Black & Puerto Rican Legislators, Inc. This award recognized her vast contributions to the growth and development of minority and women-owned businesses in New York State. Mercedes has demonstrated that a focused combination of hard-work, honesty, integrity and a sense of community buy-in is the formula for achieving success.  On November 2, 2021, Mercedes was victorious in the General Election and is now the Council Member for the 46th Council District in Brooklyn.

Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.

As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.

Introduction This bill would require the Commissioner for the Aging to conduct a three-year study on Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) and Neighborhood Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (N-NORCs) in New York City. The study would identify potential NORCs and N-NORCs, assess the needs of older adults, evaluate necessary improvements, and collect data on demographic trends and health outcomes. Within two years of completing the study, the Commissioner would be required to develop and implement a plan to support aging in place within these communities. This plan would include recommendations for officially designating identified communities, resource estimates for supportive service programs, training for community-based organizations, infrastructure improvements, and the establishment of a program to provide grant funding and other resources to support the operations of community-based organizations to provide services within such identified communities. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 1054-2024 A Crystal Hudson Amended and Coupled on GO 10-year plan to support aging in place. Introduction This bill would require the Commissioner for the Aging (“the Commissioner”), in consultation with coordinating agencies, to submit a 10-year aging in place plan to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and to post the plan on the Department for the Aging’s (“the Department”) website. The aging in place plan would focus on assisting older adults with aging in place throughout New York City, including in naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities, and would include proposed projects and recommendations. The Commissioner would be required to submit the aging in place plan no later than 2 years after the effective date of the local law that enacted the plan. Two years after the publication of the aging in place plan and every two years until the plan’s completion, or until January 30, 2037, the Commissioner would be required to post on the Department’s website and to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a progress report detailing the status of projects and recommendations included in the 10-year plan.

Additionally, the plan would be expanded to include the identification of areas with a significant number of notices of claims filed with the Comptroller alleging losses due to sewer backups. Further, this bill would require DEP to provide timely notice of unconfirmed sewer backups to impacted residents and to sewer backup complainants. Such notice would include a determination from DEP that the backup complaint was not associated with a condition in the city-owned sewer system, a statement that the backup may be related to an adverse condition in a privately-owned sewer, and an informational pamphlet detailing potential causes of backups in privately-owned sewers. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 0815-2024 A James F. Gennaro Amended and Coupled on GO Creation of a flood risk area map showing both the rainfall risk area and the coastal flood risk area. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in consultation with the Department of Buildings and Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, to promulgate a rule to adopt an interim flood risk area map, showing the 10-year rainfall risk area, which includes locations in the city where there is a 10 percent chance or greater of rainfall-induced flooding in any year, incorporating the impacts of the projected 2050 sea level rise on sewer outfalls and storm drains as projected by the New York City Panel on Climate Change, and the coastal flood risk area, which includes locations in the city where there is a 1 percent chance or greater of flooding in any year, incorporating the impacts of sea level rise as projected for the year 2080 by the New York City Panel on Climate Change. The bill would require such interim map to be posted to the city’s website for at least 1 year after adoption. Additionally, the bill would require DEP to update the 10-year rainfall risk area no later than January 1, 2028, and require DEP to update both the 10-year rainfall risk area and coastal risk area within 1 year of the issuance of a new effective flood insurance rate maps for the City by the Federal Emergency Management Administration. DEP may further update such risk areas in the future. Finally, the bill would require such updated maps to be posted to the department’s website, and to include the location of the special flood hazard area, as defined by Appendix G of the New York City Building Code, the bounds of the 10-year rainfall flood risk area at either a block or individual property level, and general elevation or topography indicators for both the 10-year rainfall flood risk area and coastal flood risk area.

Eligible buildings are: condos and coops where the average assessed valuation is under $45,000 per dwelling unit, and rental buildings (i) where more than half the units are affordable, (ii) that are operated by limited-profit housing companies, or (iii) that receive substantial governmental assistance. The owners of these buildings would be able to recover up to 70% of the cost of the work at 8 1/3% per year for up to 20 years. HPD would establish the work and costs that qualify for this program in a certified reasonable cost schedule, to be updated considering factors such as local law requirements and the effects of inflation.

The Department of Buildings would inspect such units prior to issuing an authorization and, if issued, the building owner would be permitted to do any necessary construction on the unit to legalize the unit and apply for an amended or partial certificate of occupancy. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to provide technical assistance and outreach to owners of eligible basement or cellar residences. Tenants who resided in the basement or cellar unit on April 20, 2024 would have a right of first refusal to return to such unit upon its first occupancy following any necessary alterations.
