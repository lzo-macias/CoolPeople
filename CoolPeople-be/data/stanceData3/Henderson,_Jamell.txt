Jamell Henderson’s Vision: A Strong, Safe & Well-Funded District The Role of a NYC Council Member The Councilmember’s roles and responsibilities are a dual-layered leadership style, where I will be your chief representative advocating for all neighborhoods in our district while passing FUNDING, implementing POLICIES, and providing RESOURCES to help our great city move forward in the right direction. A Bold Vision for A Strong, Safe & Well-Funded District Welcome to a plan designed by and for the people of Bed-Stuy, Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, and Ocean Hill. As your candidate for City Council District 41, I will unite our diverse community through no-red-tape funding, deeply affordable housing, youth and senior initiatives, and so much more. Affordable Housing Truly Affordable for District Residents: My housing plan focuses on keeping the Area Median Income (AMI) at or below 40% and prioritizing Section 8 families for every vacant unit. This ensures our neighbors can stay where they’ve always lived, instead of being pushed out by skyrocketing rents. Standing Up for Seniors A Focus on Care & Safety: From a 24-hour senior wellness center to revamping the “Old Timers Day” celebration, I’m dedicated to protecting and uplifting older adults. By providing safe spaces, funding critical programs, and penalizing organizations that harm seniors, we honor the legacy of those who built our community. Extended After-School Hours We’ll expand programs to run until 8 PM—and even later for older youth—so students stay engaged in a safe, supportive environment year-round. This benefits working families who need reliable options and gives our young people more opportunities for learning, recreation, and skill-building well into the evening. Public School Investment No More Charter Expansions: Our public schools deserve the full support they’ve been promised. Under my leadership, new charter expansions won’t take priority over existing public schools. Instead, funding will be directed toward reducing class sizes, modernizing facilities, improving technology, reviving vocational training programs, and enhancing educational outcomes for every child. Celebrating Community Culture Carnival, Jouver’t & More: As a proud masquerader, I understand the cultural value these festivals bring to our neighborhoods—both financially and socially. By investing in events like Carnival and Jouver’t, we can safely rebuild excitement and local revenue while honoring our district’s vibrant heritage. Smart Traffic & Parking Simplified Rules & Accountability: Efficient traffic flow and clear parking regulations help everyone get around more safely. I will push for legislation that simplifies street parking signs and enforces responsible behavior from moped and bicycle delivery drivers, making our roads safer for all. No-Red-Tape Funding Faster Support for Local Organizations: I will streamline the funding process so nonprofits and community groups can access funding resources without endless delays or bureaucracy ensuring essential services—such as food pantries, youth programs, health, and senior centers —can operate effectively. Support for Business Owners $41,000 Grants & Mentorship: Small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs are the backbone of our local economy. My plan is to offer 100 residents with promising business ideas up to $41,000 each, along with mentorship from experienced professionals who reflect the cultural diversity of District 41. Union & Grassroots Partnerships Building Community Power Together: I am committed to passing legislation that directly reflects community needs by collaborating with unions and grassroots organizations. I’ll also fill empty seats on local boards with the everyday voices of District 41 so the people who live here decide how we invest and grow. Mental Health & Wellness Partnerships with Local Nonprofits: I will work closely with nonprofits already providing vital mental health services, ensuring they have the funding and resources they need. By training and deploying mental health professionals across District 41, we can address issues before they become crises. Summer Fun for Everyone Free & Affordable Group Trips: From shopping outlets to theme parks, waterparks, and local beaches, my “Summer of Soul y Sol” plan encourages free or low-cost bus trips for families. Strengthening community bonds should be as fun as it is impactful. Art & Tech Innovation I envision a 24-hour hub for digital recording, production, gaming, journalism, and entrepreneurship—giving youth and adults alike a safe place to learn, collaborate, and unleash their creative potential. If you support this vision chip in $10 today Turning This Vision into Action I’ve spent years working hand-in-hand with community leaders, current council members, and grassroots organizations—people who know law, policy, and our neighborhoods inside and out. Together, we’ve taken on challenges like housing insecurity and underfunded schools, and we’ve made real progress for our communities. As your council member, I’ll use these relationships to mobilize resources quickly, cut through red tape, and deliver the bold changes we deserve. No gimmicks—just a committed team ready to get to work and bring our district’s vision to life. Join Our Movement Together, we can build a District 41 that truly works for every resident. Whether it’s ensuring deeply affordable housing, supporting our local businesses, or bringing life back to our schools and community events, I stand ready to serve—without delay and without leaving anyone behind.
