Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. Related Companies and Other Services We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our Affiliates , including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services 1.3 Service Use We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps. We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more . You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here . 1.5 Your Device and Location We receive data through cookies and similar technologies When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy. Key Terms Affiliates Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation. 1.

Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our European Regional Privacy Notice . We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings , if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings can be found here . For Visitors, the setting is here . Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to researchers to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use your data to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.

This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2.

To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services.

However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.

Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.

Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services.

You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.

As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.

We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license . You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy. You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings). By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful. You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries. 3.2 Service Availability We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service. We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).

These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.

If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section.

If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. 6.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.  What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services? Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services. For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit LinkedIn’s Help Center . Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services. Your Choices You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to set cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. Opt out of targeted advertising As described in Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy , you have choices regarding the personalized ads you may see. LinkedIn Members can adjust their settings here . Visitor controls can be found here . Some mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile advertising IDs for targeted advertising. Browser Controls Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides. What is Do Not Track (DNT)? DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Stay Connected Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings , when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have choices about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others.

You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers.

How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Change or Correct Data : You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). Right to Access and/or Take Your Data : You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form. Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests here . You may also contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. Residents in the Designated Countries and the UK , and other regions , may have additional rights under their laws. 4.3 Account Closure We keep some of your data even after you close your account. If you choose to close your LinkedIn account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 4.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news .

Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni.

We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.

If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Stay Connected Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings , when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have choices about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones.

Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 4.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. Related Companies and Other Services We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our Affiliates , including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services 1.3 Service Use We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps. We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more . You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.

Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our European Regional Privacy Notice . We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings , if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings can be found here . For Visitors, the setting is here . Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to researchers to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use your data to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license . You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy. You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings). By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful. You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries. 3.2 Service Availability We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service. We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services.

These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section. If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. 6.

However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2.

However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.

If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.

As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.

Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our European Regional Privacy Notice . We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings , if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings can be found here . For Visitors, the setting is here . Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.

We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies.

Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

We don't yet have any member controls to generate your own MITN entries. An algorithm determines whether a news item mentioning a common name like John Smith is about your friend John Smith or a different John Smith. While this algorithm is good, it's not perfect. It's a good idea to check that the person or organization in an article is the same person or organization you're following. If you see any news item associated with the wrong person or organization (or any offensive or inappropriate content in a news item), please report it by clicking the Wrong Person or Wrong Organization flag. News stories about you When our algorithm identifies a news story that mentions you, you'll receive a You Made the News email. This email includes the news stories about you that are shared with your LinkedIn connections and followers, should your privacy settings allow such sharing. If there's an article that's incorrectly associated with you or that you'd like to remove, click Remove Article . If you'd like to share a news article that mentions you more widely, click Share . We can't guarantee that every article about you or a person or organization you follow is picked up. This could be because the name is too common for our system to be confident in the match, the article content is considered objectionable, or the publication (i.e. New York Times) doesn't allow us to pull articles from its site, among other reasons. If you don't want your connections and followers to know when you're mentioned in the news, you can opt out of this feature in your privacy settings . Please note that this option is not available to organizations, and generally we are not able to remove accurate associations to companies or other organizations upon request.

You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy . 1.2 Members and Visitors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.” 1.3 Changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account . Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others.

You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful. You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries. 3.2 Service Availability We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service. We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).

You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature . Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products. You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.

Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others.

For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license .

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section. If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. 6.

The easiest way to control how your data is processed if you are a Member is via your account settings and if you are a Visitor via your Guest settings . If you are a Visitor and you would like to contact LinkedIn about processing of your data or exercising the rights outlined in this section, you can reach out using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this form . Members can also object, correct inaccurate data, delete data, port data and in some cases restrict the use of their data as set out in this section: Accessing your data Members can access and download their data at any time. We will provide your data in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your Member Settings . You can learn more about how to download your data here. Correct and rectify your data When Members are signed in to our platform you can always review and update your profile information. You can also ask us to change, rectify or not use your data if it is not accurate. You can edit or correct most of your personal data at any time directly in your account settings. If there is any personal data not listed in your account settings that you would like to correct or update you can complete a data rectification form. You can learn more about how you can change or correct your personal data here . Deleting your data You can request that we delete your personal data. Most of your profile data can be deleted through your account settings. You can learn more about deleting your data here. For any data that cannot be deleted in your settings, you can submit a Data Deletion request form . If you would like to delete all your personal data from LinkedIn, you can always choose to close your account. Restricting the use of your data One of the ways you can restrict how your data is used is in your Data Privacy settings and your Advertising Data settings . You can also request that processing of your data is restricted if the data is inaccurate or if you believe that the processing is unlawful by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this form . Objecting to the use of your data You also have the right to object to processing your data where legitimate interest or public interest is the legal basis for processing that data. To exercise your right to object you can contact us by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or complete our Data Processing Objection form . Where you raise an objection, we will consider your request, our legal obligations, and whether we have a compelling interest in continuing to process your data. In certain cases, consistent with your legal rights and our obligations, we may not be able to fulfil your request—for example, we cannot stop processing your IP address when it is used to authenticate your login details, as this is a security measure that is essential to protect our site. In contrast, you can remove information about your education or work experience from your profile (although as a result, the job recommendations you receive may not be relevant to you) so that we don’t process it. Where we use your data for direct marketing (e.g. to send you marketing emails) or profiling for the purposes of direct marketing, you always have the right to object and we will stop using your data for this purpose. Portability If we use your personal data to perform a contract with you, or with your consent, you have the right to receive your data and port it to another controller. You can download your data anytime in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your Member Settings and can learn more about how to download your data here. LinkedIn also provides an API program to enable third parties to build integrations with LinkedIn to port data on a Member’s consent in the EEA, EU and Switzerland only. You can find more details in the Member Portability APIs help centre article. Withdrawing your consent When you give us consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent via Member settings for certain processing, or by contacting us here . When you withdraw your consent, this won’t affect our use of your data up to that point. Joint Controller Relationship We share insights with entities who have LinkedIn Business Pages on our platform, which include certain Member profile information and interaction data. We are a joint controller with the organisation or legal entity who administers the Business Page for this purpose, and Members can find out more information about LinkedIn’s responsibilities here . Data Retention We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalised or aggregated form. You can delete data from your profile or your activity on LinkedIn. If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn. Search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo! may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about how your profile shows up in search engine results . Where we share your data with other third parties, as set out in our Privacy Policy , e.g. via the LinkedIn Developer Program, they may retain data in accordance with their own retention policies, or in line with our contractual agreements with them. For data that LinkedIn collects using cookies, you can see how long LinkedIn processes it for by checking the expiration periods in our Cookie table . LinkedIn may also collect information about you from cookies on third party websites. For data collected from third party websites where a LinkedIn customer has installed LinkedIn’s tag, LinkedIn de-identifies your personal data after 7 days and permanently deletes it after 180 days. There are a number of reasons why we might need to retain some of your data for longer than usual. These may include: Where LinkedIn has suspended your account for inappropriate, harmful or illegal activity that breaches our Professional Community Guidelines and/or we need to resolve complaints relating to your account. Where there is ongoing or potential legal or regulatory proceedings related to your account. Where we are required by law to retain your data. For more information on when we may be required to retain your data for these purposes, see the “ Compliance with Legal Obligations ” section above. Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law. LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework here . LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses here .

Members engage with LinkedIn in different ways: connecting with members they know, following companies and members, searching for people and information, sharing and engaging with content, or looking for new career opportunities, to name a few. We use the information and engagement data that we have about our members and content on our services to make recommendations for connections, content, and features that may be useful to you.  We present that information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, we use algorithms to learn about your interests and to help organize engaging content on your Feed, in addition to recommending relevant jobs and member connections. These algorithms also filter out or taper distribution of low-quality and unsafe content to enhance the value of what you see on your Feed. You can find more information about how we personalize your experience below. Feed A member’s feed includes content from a variety of sources, such as their connections, people or companies they follow, and the groups they belong to. This content could be a followed member’s post, a connection’s comment on someone else’s post, or a post from a group to which the member belongs. A member’s feed may also include content from outside of a member’s network that we think may be relevant to the member. By using machine learning algorithms, LinkedIn is able to assess many signals that help us understand a member’s preferences, and it enables us to provide a diverse, professional, high-quality, and personalized feed experience to each member. The main signals that we assess fall into three categories: Identity : We seek to contextualize content based on who a member is by looking at their profile, for example: Who are you? Where do you work? What are your skills? Where is your profile location? Content : We aim to match appropriate content to each member by evaluating, for example: How many times was the feed update viewed? How many times was it reacted to ? What is the content about? How old is it? Is the update sharing knowledge or professional advice? Is the update from someone you are connected to or follow? What language is it written in? Is the conversation constructive and professional? Will engagement on the update lead to future high quality content? What companies, people, or topics are mentioned in the update? Member Activity : Finally, we look at how a member engages with content and examine, for example: What have you reacted to and shared in the past? Who do you interact with most frequently or recently? Where do you spend the most time in your feed? Which hashtags, people or companies do you follow? Who are your connections? What types of topics are you interested in? What other members follow you? What actions have other members taken on your posts? How long has it been since the foregoing actions took place? Other than sponsored content, which is clearly labeled as such, our feed distribution is not influenced by payments from third parties to LinkedIn. Your choices for how information is presented to you: As described in more detail below, a member can control and refine the content of their feed by taking actions, such as by following or unfollowing members, companies, or hashtags, by hiding or reporting content, or by opting to sort feed content by when it was posted. Here are some best practices and controls we provide to you to customize your feed: Control menu - You can tell us what you want to see more and less of by clicking the three dots (...) on a post. This will open a toolbox of options available , including: Unfollow or mute people, companies, and hashtags - You can unfollow or mute people, companies and hashtags if you no longer want to see their posts. Tell us what you dislike - If you see content in your feed that you don't believe to be high-quality or relevant to you, you can choose “I don’t want to see this post”. You can let us know why you aren’t interested in seeing the content anymore. Flag inappropriate content - We encourage you to report inappropriate or offensive content to help us keep LinkedIn constructive. Add new perspectives to your feed - If you want to get updates from a member or company on your feed, you can choose to follow them. You can also subscribe to Newsletters and you can also leverage hashtags to follow topics on LinkedIn. You can navigate directly to the My Network page which displays recommended sources to follow and members with whom to connect. Sort updates - At the top of your LinkedIn homepage, you can control if your feed shows recent updates or organizes updates by relevancy. This feature is only available on the desktop experience. Some of your feed updates may be delivered as push notifications and/or emails. You can control these by customizing your email settings and push notification settings. Search LinkedIn users (including members and guests) can conduct a search at the top of any LinkedIn page. A user has the option to “See all results” for a keyword(s) search or to narrow a search by categories such as jobs, services, people or groups. Our predictive text feature will help predict related search terms as a user types keywords into the search bar; of course, the predictive text feature can be bypassed by typing in keyword(s). The most frequently used search filters will be located at the top of the search results page, and all additional search filters are located in the “All filters” section. The LinkedIn search algorithms are designed to return personalized and relevant search results for each member. While search algorithms may evaluate different pieces of information for each search category, all of our search algorithms are built to return meaningful search results. For example: Our People search algorithm generates unique search results for each member. Search results order is determined, in part, by a member’s profile, activity, and connections, along with considerations such as search activity on LinkedIn, the relative public prominence of certain profiles, and other members who have run similar searches and their engagement with the results. Our Pages search algorithm returns the most active and relevant results based on a search query. The algorithm takes into consideration: Page name Number of Page followers Number of connections a member has that are connected to a Page Volume of discussions and comments on a Page Quality of updates, comments, and reactions on a Page Relative public prominence of certain Pages Maximum ratio of matching search terms to the Jobs We personalize job recommendations to you in the Jobs home tab, on job posts, in your feed, and via notifications. Learn more about how LinkedIn personalizes Job recommendations for you. You can control the jobs you are recommended by updating your profile, using search alerts, turning notifications on or off, searching for jobs, or expressing your preferences when you use the “Open to work” feature. Members in the EEA (European Economic Area) may opt-out of personalized Job recommendations. If you are not in the EEA, you can control your job recommendations as described above.

Privacy Privacy Settings Privacy FAQs Regional info EU Notice U.S. State Laws LGPD Republic of Korea China Japan Quebec EU Notice U.S. State Laws LGPD Republic of Korea China Japan Quebec Privacy Policy Privacy Settings Privacy FAQs Regional info EU Notice U.S. State Laws LGPD Republic of Korea China Japan Quebec EU Notice U.S. State Laws LGPD Republic of Korea China Japan Quebec Privacy Policy Learn more about U.S. State Privacy Laws  Several U.S. states have enacted privacy laws to grant new privacy rights to their residents. These laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act ) (CCPA) and comprehensive consumer privacy laws enacted in Virginia , Colorado , Connecticut , Utah , Oregon , Texas , Florida, Montana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Delaware, and New Jersey, among others. Depending on the state, these laws, as applicable, provide individuals with rights to: Access their information Correct their inaccurate information Opt out if a business “sells” their information, uses or shares it for certain advertising purposes, or profiles them to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects Be notified about a business’s data practices Nondiscrimination for exercising their privacy rights Delete their personal information Appeal if a business refuses to delete, correct, or provide their information (if LinkedIn denies such a request, you will be able to appeal by responding to the message we send to inform you of our decision) The goals and key requirements of these laws are consistent with LinkedIn's longstanding commitment to data protection and transparency. This commitment is reflected in our focus on building privacy into our products, providing our members with control over their data and being transparent about how we use member data. Our Privacy Policy contains more information about the types of information we collect, how we use it, the circumstances under which we share it with others, how you can exercise your rights, and how to contact us. You can learn more about how we comply with the CCPA in our California Consumer Privacy Act Notice , which supplements our Privacy Policy . For purposes of the Colorado Privacy Act and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, we do not sell your data, engage in targeted advertising (i.e. select ads based on activities outside our own websites or applications), or profile you to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects. However, we offer members many choices to control their experience with ads. You may also find additional useful information on managing your LinkedIn profile in our Privacy FAQs . Commitment regarding deidentified data Under some laws, “deidentified” information is not considered personal information where a company commits that it will not attempt to reidentify it. Where we process information that we regard as deidentified, we will maintain and use it in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify it.

We are committed to keeping our platform safe and professional for all users. In some areas, laws require us to restrict access to our services for users who are not yet adults ("Minors”). The LinkedIn experience and access to our services may not be available to Minors depending on where they live. How old do I have to be to use LinkedIn? You must be at least 16 years old to use LinkedIn. In regions where the law requires you to be older than 16 to use our services without parental consent, the minimum age is the age at which such parental consent is not required. How does LinkedIn determine my age? How we determine the age of members varies regionally, depending on applicable laws. For example, we may ask for your date of birth because laws require us to ask all users for that information when they sign up. If you believe we incorrectly identify you as a Minor and have limited your LinkedIn experience accordingly, you can contest this by submitting an Age Correction Form . When I try to sign up for LinkedIn, I get a notice saying I’m too young to join. Why can’t I create a LinkedIn account? We love seeing ambitious people like you, but we can’t allow anyone under 16 or those who are considered Minors in certain regions to create an account. We look forward to welcoming you when you reach the minimum age! If you’re an adult and received a message that you are too young to join LinkedIn, you can submit an Age Correction Form to contest your age. I have an account, but I got a notice saying I’m too young to use LinkedIn in my location. What can I do? We cannot offer our services to Minors in some regions due to applicable laws. If you are in one of these regions, this notice means that we’ve learned that you are a Minor and/or received a request to restrict your account. If you’re an adult and see this notice, you can submit an Age Correction Form to contest your age. When I tried to sign up for or log in to LinkedIn, I got a notice that some of my LinkedIn features are limited because I’m a Minor. What is different about my LinkedIn experience? Some regions require LinkedIn to limit certain features for Minors, such as the ads you’re served, the notifications we send to you, and the messages you receive from other members on our platform. When you become an adult, you will have access to these features and settings that control them. Learn more about how your experience will change when you become an adult. If you’re an adult and believe some of your features are limited, you may submit an Age Correction Form to contest your age. What happens when I become an adult? If your access is restricted while you are a Minor, you can join LinkedIn once you reach the minimum age in your region. If your access to certain LinkedIn features has been limited while you are a Minor, you will be eligible to access those additional features when you become an adult. Learn more about how your experience will change when you become an adult. If you're now an adult and can't access LinkedIn or certain LinkedIn features, submit an Age Correction Form to contest your age. How can I report that my Minor child is on LinkedIn? If your child has a LinkedIn account and you want to remove it from our platform, please submit a request through our Age Correction Form . If you live in a region where your child cannot use LinkedIn’s services without your consent at their current age, we will restrict their account until they reach the required minimum age. How can I make choices about my privacy on LinkedIn? Your settings are a great resource for you to make choices about your privacy on LinkedIn.

Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, LinkedIn provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow. Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, LinkedIn may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that LinkedIn has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests).

Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.

As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.

We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s).

You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).

Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Change or Correct Data : You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 4.

Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2.

However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.

Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.

We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.

You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests).

Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site.

Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to researchers to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use your data to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Change or Correct Data : You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). Right to Access and/or Take Your Data : You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form. Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests here . You may also contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. Residents in the Designated Countries and the UK , and other regions , may have additional rights under their laws. 4.3 Account Closure We keep some of your data even after you close your account. If you choose to close your LinkedIn account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 4.

I've been speaking and coaching full time since 1992.

My leadership, sales and employee development programs feature my Moore’s Law of Achievement and Moore’s Path to Peak Performance that enable my clients to attract, hire, retain and develop people who become extraordinary.

I am a lifelong learner with over 40 years’ experience in Leadership, Coaching, Sales Training and Employee Development, I created Moore Leadership & Peak Performance which includes workshops and coaching sessions that address the specific challenges faced by everyone in the Homebuilding, Building Supply, Floor Covering, Design Center and Retail Industries.

The CCPA requires businesses like us to provide certain information to California consumers. We fully describe our practices to all our members and visitors in our Privacy Policy , but use this separate notice to ensure that we meet the CCPA’s requirements. This notice contains the following four parts: You Can Opt Out of Our Sharing Your Personal Information. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information.

Your Rights Under the CCPA The CCPA provides Californians with the following rights: 2.1 Requests for Information Like all of our members, you (or your authorized agent) can request a copy of your personal information . Under the CCPA, you can also request that we disclose how we have collected, used, and disclosed your personal information over the past 12 months, including the categories of personal information we collected and our purposes for doing so; the categories of sources for that information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared it or disclosed it for a business purpose and our purposes for doing so. Companies that sell personal information (we do not) must make additional disclosures.

We only use sensitive personal information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out. 2.5 Your Right to Notification Under the CCPA, a business like LinkedIn cannot collect new categories of personal information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you. 2.6 Nondiscrimination for Exercising Your CCPA Rights The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights. 2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information Like all of our members, you can edit much of your personal information through your LinkedIn account (such as your profile information). You can also request that we correct inaccurate personal information . 2.8 Your Right to Delete Personal Information Like all of our members, you can request that we delete your personal information by closing your LinkedIn account or by requesting that we delete specific information about you. We honor such requests unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or contract for which it was collected or when information is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, identify and repair bugs, or ensure another consumer’s ability to exercise their free speech rights or other rights provided by law. 2.9 LinkedIn Annual CCPA Metrics Please visit LinkedIn's CCPA Annual Metrics page to view metrics required by CCPA regulations for the past calendar year. 2.10 Statement Regarding Selling or Sharing the Personal Information of Consumers Under Age 16 CCPA regulations require us to state whether we have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.

Program Details Areas and topics Analytics: Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of actionable insights from big data. At LinkedIn, our mission is to drive understanding and impactful decision-making through rigorous use of data.

LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We will achieve this through the creation of the Economic Graph , a digital mapping of the global economy, which will provide all the necessary elements to connect talent with opportunity at massive scale.  What is the Economic Graph Research program? The Economic Graph Research Program is an initiative in which LinkedIn works with academic researchers to conduct research that relates to creating economic opportunity for members of the global workforce and helping them be more productive and successful. Together, we believe we can effectively remove barriers to economic growth and create opportunity for every member of the global workforce.  What’s the history of the Economic Graph Research Program? Two years ago, we launched an ambitious project called the Economic Graph Challenge (EGC). The idea was simple: There are approximately 3 billion people in the global workforce, and LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every one of them. By mapping economic relationships and developing the world's first Economic Graph, we can make that vision a reality. We asked ourselves a question: How might LinkedIn’s vast dataset be used to help researchers develop studies that have the potential to create greater economic opportunity? Early on, we found that working with outside researchers has helped us better understand the impact that LinkedIn’s data can have when it comes to describing the world economy. These perspectives help us build better member experiences and give others new insights into the world around them. In April 2017, we launched the LinkedIn Economic Graph Research program to encourage researchers, academics and data-driven thinkers to solve some of the most challenging economic problems of our times.  How many teams of researchers are involved in the Economic Graph Research Program? The “Economic Graph Challenge” on-boarded a total of 11 teams. One team from the original EGC group has had their contract extended to continue their research, while the other teams no longer have access. Currently, we are in process of negotiating with a second round of teams to join the program.  What is the selection process for including new research teams in the Economic Graph Research program? Researchers must submit a proposal that is vetted by LinkedIn’s legal and security teams for privacy and security concerns before their proposal is selected. When a researcher is selected, either their organization (generally a university) or in some cases the individual themselves must enter into an agreement with LinkedIn. EGR teams are limited to a total of 5 team members. As of June 15, 2017 the Economic Graph Research (EGR) program call for proposals has closed.  What is the timeline for the selection process? LinkedIn’s EGR team will review submitted proposals and notify selected proposals within 3 months of the end of the submission period. LinkedIn’s EGR team will review submitted proposals and notify selected proposals within 3 months of the end of the submission period. We might ask for supplemental materials such as an endorsement letter from the higher-level management of the organization We might ask for supplemental materials such as an endorsement letter from the higher-level management of the organization Proposals will be evaluated on a combination of three factors: Novelty: the thoughtfulness and originality of the entry, including its unique approach to taking advantage of data from the Economic Graph. Impact: the potential benefits to the region, country and the world, as well as the extensibility of the proposal. Feasibility: the practicality of the submission, measuring the likelihood it can be researched and implemented within a reasonable time period and the types of data from LinkedIn that will be necessary for the proposed research.

These clauses are contractual commitments between companies transferring personal data (for example, from LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company to its suppliers or to LinkedIn Corporation), binding them to protect the privacy and security of the data. LinkedIn companies adopted Standard Contractual Clauses so that the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services take place legally. If you are in the Designated Countries or the UK, you can contact LinkedIn to request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual Clauses. LinkedIn’s Data Privacy Framework Statement On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework thereby designating the United States as a country that ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU/EEA. LinkedIn Corporation and its controlled U.S. subsidiaries (“LinkedIn”) comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.

For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.

If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services.

For example, public profiles can be found through search engines. In addition, users of certain mail or other communication or networking services may also see in those services "mini" profiles of members they interact with. You may prefer to limit the visibility of your profile information outside of LinkedIn. Below are two settings that enable you to do that. Public profile Anyone can see your public profile in search engines, as well as in apps and other services as described above. Learn how to hide or show your public profile . Other services (formerly "third party applications"), excluding search engines Through our partnerships and developer program, we enable certain affiliates, partners, customers, and other permitted developers to display to their users information from the profiles of members they meet, write to or about, manage or consider for talent or other opportunities, take social actions (e.g. follow their company), etc. Some examples include Outlook and Yahoo Mail , Calendar or Contacts, Apple and Samsung native mail, contacts and calendar phone apps, Cortana , Evernote , social media aggregators (e.g. tools for company brand administrators to consolidate interactions with followers across social media), talent and lead managers. You can opt out using this setting (formerly known as "sharing data with third parties"). To manage your Profile visibility off LinkedIn settings: Click the ﻿﻿﻿ Me icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage. Click Settings & Privacy . In the Visibility section, click Profile discovery and visibility off LinkedIn . Switch the toggle to On to show information from your profile to users of permitted services. Switch the toggle to Off to opt out of this setting. Note: Changing the above setting doesn’t limit visibility on search engines, which is controlled by the public profile setting. It also doesn’t limit the ability for Page owners to export your profile data and individual interactions with their Page, if you permit such access via the Page owners exporting your data setting. Many of the users of these services are LinkedIn members who opt in to link their LinkedIn account with their account on the other service. Depending on the nature of the specific integration, these users could see up to the same profile information (including connections data ) seen on LinkedIn. This may be more than the public profile of members who haven’t disabled profile visibility off LinkedIn in their settings . Other users of these services may not be members or are members who did not link their accounts yet. They can see the public profiles of members who didn't opt out as noted above. The visibility of profiles to such users is controlled by both the opt out above, and by the public profile settings noted below. Learn more about public and private profiles .

You can control what appears on your profile, notifications to your network, and your profile privacy preferences under the Profile privacy section of the Settings & Privacy page. Check out some of the exceptions and learn how to manage your information: Contact and personal information that you’ve provided in the Contact Info section of your profile is only visible to your 1st-degree connections. People you've emailed before and who've added you to their LinkedIn contacts can see your email address. Other information that could be used to contact you, such as your webpage, blog URL or Twitter handle, may be visible to all members. If your 1st-degree connections have chosen to not show their email address, this won’t be visible under Contact Info section. Learn more about visibility of your email address . Unless you make your connections only visible to you, your 1st-degree connections can see who you're connected to on LinkedIn. Also, all members who have connections in common with you can see those shared connections. Learn more about controlling who can see your connections . You can limit the visibility of your posts and shares , profile photo , last name and birth date . If any member searches by your first or last name, they can see your full profile unless you've blocked them. Learn more about blocking . Note that our predictive, type-ahead functionality allows for a name search to be performed with a few letters of a name, even if it includes typos. The number and result of profile searches can be limited depending on the type of account the searcher has, the type of search involved (e.g. by name or keyword / category), and the commercial use limit on search. We do not require members to include sensitive data (e.g., race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, sexual life or criminal record) in their LinkedIn profile. If you choose to post any such data to your profile, understand that it is visible to others as noted above. Note: Depending on your settings, a version of your profile may also be visible to users who aren't signed in to LinkedIn and are searching for your profile on search engines like Bing, Google, Duck Duck Go, etc. Subject to your off-LinkedIn visibility settings , some of all of this version of your profile may also be displayed to users of mail and calendar applications that show them a "mini" LinkedIn profile of the person they're meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers, and other permitted services. It can also be printed to PDF. You can change your public profile settings to limit the visibility of specific sections or turn-off your public profile.

If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn.

Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law. LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework here . LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses here .

We respect the laws that apply to our business operations, but we put our members first by requiring that such requests follow established legal procedures and by notifying members of requests for their data unless prohibited by statute or court order. We also believe in being transparent about the number and type of requests we receive, and we issue a Transparency Report twice a year. How our process works: Follow the Law . Except in limited emergency situations, law enforcement agents seeking information about member accounts must be made through formal U.S. legal procedures, such as subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. Please note that certain types of member data, including messages, invitations and connections, have a high bar for disclosure and can only be disclosed pursuant to a valid search warrant from an entity with proper jurisdiction. Data requests from outside of the United States and the EU generally must be made through an official Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) or, letter rogatory. How Can Law Enforcement Officials Ask for Data? All requests must include the agent's Badge/ID number, contact information, and must specify the member account by providing either (1) the full name of the member and email address associated with the account; or (2) the LinkedIn public profile URL. Data requests may be served by submitting the request via this link: https://app.kodex.us/linkedin/signin by certified mail, express courier, or in person at one of the following two locations below: For all non-EU -based requests (includes U.S. requests): LinkedIn Corporation ATTN: Legal Department 1000 West Maude Avenue Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA For all EU based requests: LinkedIn Ireland U.C. ATTN: Legal Department Wilton Plaza Wilton Place, Dublin 2 Ireland What if it's an emergency? In very rare circumstances involving imminent serious bodily harm or death, we will consider responding to an emergency request for data. These requests must be submitted using the Emergency Disclosure Request Form included in LinkedIn's Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines, and must be signed under penalty of perjury by a law enforcement agent. More details are provided in LinkedIn's Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines (PDF) . Tagged in Data and Privacy Data and Privacy  LinkedIn LinkedIn Contact us Select a language.

These patterns help us make your professional communications more efficient and informed. For example, our systems do the following: Look for specific strings of characters that indicate an emoji to render it as an image. Look for text that indicates a web link (e.g. ends with ".com" or similar) to render a preview of the linked page. When you start typing a name in the addressee field, attempt to anticipate who the recipient may be and provide auto-complete options. Look for mentions of member or company names to add links to their profiles and LinkedIn Pages, respectively. Check links shared in messages for malicious sites and look for blacklisted keywords to detect spam. Suggest potentially relevant responses (e.g., messaging suggestions). Look for viruses or other harmful code among attachments. Look for certain characters (e.g. question mark at the end of a message) and context-specific keywords to propose relevant responses (smart replies). Look for mentions of video chats, weekdays, or dates to see if our software can help you set up a meeting. Detect and prevent likely harmful content. Our systems sometimes use these insights together with contextual information. For instance: If the sender is a recruiter, it's more likely that a message containing certain characters or words is about a job opportunity. Our systems may then propose messaging suggestions accordingly. When a newly opened LinkedIn account sends frequent messages with certain words and links previously seen in other messages flagged as spam by members, our systems may detect these messages as spam. Although recognizing text patterns in a message is often done at a very basic level (e.g. recognizing a string of characters that make an emoji), our systems sometimes use machine learning to develop and provide more complex functionality. This essentially means that our analytical models and algorithms are improved over time based on members' usage. For instance, whether and how members use messaging suggestions or our messaging assistant helps refine the suggestions or other assistance and when they are presented. The refinement of our spam detection models as described above is another example of machine learning based on user feedback. You can opt out of our automated scanning of your incoming private messages for content that violates our Professional Community Policies . Members in the European Union are opted-out by default due to privacy laws, and all other countries are opted-in by default. However, our automated systems will always provide basic defenses against spam, money fraud, viruses, malware, and malicious sites. The opt-out setting for harmful messages does not impact basic defenses. Please note that with respect to our messaging assistant and similar bots, you have the choice to opt-in or not by adding, mentioning, or responding to such bots in a conversation.

You can use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and learn aggregate insights about categories of members interacting with your ads. What is needed to install the LinkedIn Insight Tag and how long does it take? The process takes only a few minutes. Add the JavaScript code (unique to your LinkedIn account) to your website. There is no maintenance necessary once the code is in place. Related tasks ﻿ Add the LinkedIn Insight Tag to your website Will this piece of code slow down my website? The LinkedIn Insight Tag was designed to manage speed and complexity. It loads asynchronously with the current website and shouldn't slow down the performance of your website. What data does my website send through this tag and how is it used? The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to your website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. The IP addresses are truncated or hashed (when used for reaching members across devices ), and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days. Regarding the Website Actions feature, learn more about the button layout and engagement data involved. If you enable enhanced matching, you can also send emails associated to the respective visits. Those emails are hashed on the website before being sent to LinkedIn, to protect members’ privacy – we only match information we already have, the rest remains unreadable. Learn more about enhanced matching for your website . We don't share the personal data of members with you; we only provide reports and alerts (which do not identify members) about the professional makeup of your website audience and ad performance. We also provide retargeting for website visitors, enabling you to show personalized ads off your website by using this data, but without identifying the member. We also use data that doesn't identify members to improve ad relevance and reach members across devices . LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings . Does LinkedIn support image pixels? We recommend using our JavaScript tag. If you need a pixel-based solution for conversion tracking, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event to generate a code that can be added to a page or button on your website. Can I track conversions with on-click action (like on a button or in an iframe)? Yes, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event. A code is generated that can be added to a page or button on your website. Please note, buttons that appear on iframes won’t appear on the Website Actions list. Important to know Consistent with our terms , the Insight Tag should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data. This can include pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers. For example, depending on the content of the pages, the Insight Tag may be included on a generic homepage for a pharmacy or a bank, or business-to-business pages directed only to organizations and financial or healthcare professionals, but should not be included on consumer pages for certain types of medications or pages where users manage their financial accounts and transactions or medical appointments, since it could lead to the inadvertent collection and sharing of sensitive information regarding the health or finances of individuals who visited that page. This does not constitute legal advice. Please consult with your webmaster and legal counsel to determine which pages may or may not collect sensitive data.

While we work to fix the issue, there are steps you can take to access your LinkedIn content and settings after completing your two-step verification and clicking, Yes, it’s me. On your iOS device, go to your browser to access LinkedIn.com. Alternatively, you can access your content and settings from a browser on desktop computer Two-step verification (2FA) is a type of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) that requires a person to use more than one form of verification to access an account, usually by "knowing something" such as a password and by "having something" such as a mobile device. Two-step verification can greatly reduce unauthorized access to most accounts by identifying new or unknown computers or devices. LinkedIn encourages all members to turn on two-step verification. Two methods of verification are available: Text (SMS) verification. Authenticator app verification (like Microsoft Authenticator). LinkedIn recommends the authenticator app as the preferred two-step verification method. How does two-step verification work? When LinkedIn does not recognize the device that you're attempting to sign in from, you'll be asked to enter your account password as the first layer of verification and a pin code as the second layer of verification. The pin code will be sent to your phone via SMS or authenticator app, depending on the two-step verification method you selected. If you are logged into LinkedIn on a mobile device and have push notifications enabled, you will receive a push notification on your mobile device with a sign-in security prompt instead of one of the 2FA methods. Learn more about the sign-in security prompt here. Important : LinkedIn requires all Recruiter , Campaign Manager , and Sales Navigator users to turn on two-step verification through their LinkedIn.com accounts in order to access their Recruiter, Campaign Manager, and Sales Navigator accounts.

However, if you were previously verified, your educational institution verification will remain on your profile. At LinkedIn, we know that authenticity is key to creating meaningful interactions. A verification badge on your profile shows that you were able to confirm specific information about your account, such as your: Identity Workplace Educational institution A verification badge helps you signal authenticity and build trust, giving others more confidence to reach out. Our data shows that verified members organically see higher profile views and engagement. When you are logged in to LinkedIn, a verified member will have the verified badge displayed next to the member's name on their profile: Currently, LinkedIn supports several forms of verification. Each form of verification has its own eligibility and availability criteria, which you can learn more about below. Identity verification An identity verification means that a member’s government-issued ID was verified by one of LinkedIn’s verification partners. Currently, identity verification is limited to select geographies. We may expand identity verification globally and add more verification partners in the future. In the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, the identity verification is performed by CLEAR, a third-party identity verification service. It's available for those with a valid government-issued ID and a personal phone number registered in either the U.S., Canada, or Mexico. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out Identity verification via CLEAR . A free CLEAR account will be created for you during the process if you don’t have one already. This is separate from the paid CLEAR Plus membership for airport security access. If you already have a CLEAR account, you can continue the verification using your CLEAR identity. In India, identity verification is available to members with DigiLocker credentials that meet certain other requirements. In many additional countries, the identity verification is performed by Persona, a third-party identity verification service. It’s available for those with a valid NFC-enabled passport. To learn more about the availability, how this verification works, and the steps to verify, check out Identity verification via Persona . LinkedIn members have the option to verify their identity by uploading a government ID and/or taking a live selfie using services provided by the above trusted partners. These trusted partners (and their authorized processors) have sole access to such data and it is deleted according to the applicable trusted partner’s privacy policy. LinkedIn does not receive any biometric data about LinkedIn members from these partners. Workplace verification A workplace verification means that a member has confirmed their association with the specific company using their work email, Microsoft Entra Verified ID, a LinkedIn Learning license provided by their company, or an active LinkedIn Recruiter license provided by their company. Via work email: You can verify your workplace by providing your current company email address and confirming it through a code sent to that email. Currently, this method of verification is eligible to limited companies. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out Workplace verification using your work email . Via Microsoft Entra Verified ID: If your company uses Microsoft Entra Verified ID and has taken specific steps to enable workplace verification, you’ll be able to verify and display a verification on your LinkedIn profile. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out Workplace verification via Microsoft Entra Verified ID . Via LinkedIn Learning license: If your company has provided you with a LinkedIn Learning license and has been included in workplace verification, you can display a workplace verification on your LinkedIn profile. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out Workplace verification via LinkedIn Learning . Via active LinkedIn Recruiter license: At this time, workplace verification is not available to all companies. However, if your company provides its employees with the LinkedIn Recruiter corporate subscription product, and you are assigned a Recruiter User role, Recruiter Admin role or a custom role featuring a Hiring Project Creator license with Recruiter Search permissions, you may be able to add and display a Verified Recruiter label workplace verification on your LinkedIn profile. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out workplace verification with a LinkedIn Recruiter license . Educational institution verification with a LinkedIn Learning License An education verification means the individual's association with an educational institution has been verified using a supported LinkedIn Learning license provided by that institution. If your educational institution has provided you with a LinkedIn Learning license and has been included in educational institution verification, you can display a verification on your LinkedIn profile. To learn more about how this verification works and the steps to verify, check out Educational institution verification via LinkedIn Learning . Verification details Adding verifications is optional. It’s not a required step to complete your profile. There is no additional cost to verify your information and to add verifications to your LinkedIn profile. Verifications are visible, but you can remove them anytime. A verification indicating that your identity, workplace, or educational institution is confirmed will be visible on your profile when you complete the verification process. The information used for verification (i.e. the email address, information on your ID card, or the workplace credential) will not be visible. The issuing country of your ID may be visible on your profile. You can remove verifications anytime in settings . Learn more about our practices in our Privacy Policy . Verifications on your profile may change. For example: The location and the placement of the badge may change as the feature evolves. A verification may be removed if your organization changes the approved email domains for workplace verification with work email or if you haven’t renewed your verification. If you change your name, you may have to re-verify to keep your verification visible on your profile. When you verify your identity, workplace, or educational institution, the name you use must match the name on your LinkedIn profile. Your verification may be shown on other features on the LinkedIn platform. For example, if you’re a customer with access to Job Slots and you actively post jobs, your verifications may show up on the jobs you post. These verifications are meant to help you build trust with job seekers and potential candidates. We continue to expand eligibility and availability, and new types of verifications may become available in the future.

Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our European Regional Privacy Notice . We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings , if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings can be found here . For Visitors, the setting is here . Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them. 2.5 Marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to researchers to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Except as described in our Privacy Policy, LinkedIn doesn't authorize the collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from our members on LinkedIn for third party use through advertising technologies without separate member consent. To learn more about DNT and LinkedIn's DNT practices, please read on: On September 27, 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law A.B. 370, amending the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) to require website operators like LinkedIn to disclose how LinkedIn responds to DNT Signals; and whether third parties collect personally identifiable information (PII) about users when they visit LinkedIn. Note on CCPA : In addition to complying with CalOPPA, LinkedIn also complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020) (“CCPA”). Learn more by reviewing LinkedIn’s CCPA Notice . Do Not Track (DNT) What is DNT? DNT is the concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. What is a DNT signal? Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. Is there a DNT technology standard? The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made on this issue, it has been slow, and to date no standard has been adopted. Without an industry standard for DNT, users cannot know how any given company abides by a DNT signal they receive from browser headers. LinkedIn is committed to remaining apprised of the W3C efforts to develop a DNT standard. How does LinkedIn respond to the signal? LinkedIn takes privacy and security very seriously and strives to put our members first in all aspects of our business. With regard to DNT, LinkedIn currently doesn't respond to DNT signals in browsers because no DNT standard has been adopted, as noted above. What about JavaScript buttons like Share on LinkedIn? When someone visits websites that contain JavaScript buttons ("plugins"), like LinkedIn's Share button, we receive plugin passive impression data that we depersonalize immediately. When members actively interact with our plugins (for example, sharing articles on LinkedIn), we keep this information to provide respective functionality and improve their, and others' LinkedIn experience. Learn more about how we use and protect plugin data . Does LinkedIn share members' personally identifiable information with third parties (like advertisers and ad networks)? As the world's largest professional network, our hundreds of millions of members come to LinkedIn to connect with other members, find jobs, and be found by other members for any number of professional reasons. LinkedIn is, inherently, a public place, and there is a lot of PII on LinkedIn that is viewable by any visitor. In other words, third parties can find out about you from the info you share on our services. In the DNT context, however, LinkedIn doesn't authorize the identification of LinkedIn members by third parties through advertising technologies deployed in ads that may appear on LinkedIn without separate consent. Please note, that our Privacy Policy uses the definition of "direct marketing" provided by the California Civil Code §1798.83, to include marketing directly to individuals by means of mail, phone, or e-mail for personal purposes. Thank you. A Do Not Track (DNT) standard has not been adopted to this day, and therefore LinkedIn doesn't use DNT signals.

Advertisers may collect and use third-party data to better reach their target audiences on and off LinkedIn. This third-party data may be contact information that you share with third parties or collected when you visit third-party websites. Once collected, advertisers can include this information in their ad campaigns to define and reach a targeted, high-quality audience that is relevant to their business. Please note that LinkedIn does not tell these advertisers who you are. Third-Party data from your interactions with businesses Contact Targeting Contact targeting is a LinkedIn Marketing Solutions feature that allows advertisers to upload lists of contacts to include as part of their target audience for ad campaigns. If you have already interacted with a company and provided them with your name or contact information (e.g. to sign-up for a newsletter or webinar), they may include you in a target audience for a LinkedIn ad campaign using contact targeting. Data Integration Another way advertisers can include contacts in a LinkedIn ad campaign is through data integration with a third-party contact management platform. If an advertiser uses a contact management platform, they may integrate the data collected there with their LinkedIn ad campaign. Please note that with both contact targeting lists and data integrations, LinkedIn only receives hashed contact information from third parties. By applying hashing algorithms to the email addresses or other contacts, the text is rendered unreadable (in other words, LinkedIn does not keep new contact information about its members or anyone else), but it can be used to map advertisers' lists of users to LinkedIn members in order to serve them relevant ads. LinkedIn doesn't disclose to the advertiser the members who see the ads. LinkedIn only provides aggregated data regarding the ad performance. Third-party data from your interactions with websites Website Retargeting Advertisers can also use third-party data from their own company websites for LinkedIn ad campaigns if they enable the LinkedIn Insight Tag on their website. The Insight Tag is JavaScript code that tracks visits of LinkedIn members on third-party sites where the tag is enabled. Advertisers can then use this information about their website visitors to understand their site professional demographics, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns, and they can include their website visitors in audiences for their ad campaigns. Just like with contact targeting, LinkedIn does not identify individual members to advertisers using website retargeting and only reports site professional demographics and ad performance in the aggregate. Also, LinkedIn itself removes members’ direct identifiers within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days. What controls do I have as a LinkedIn member regarding the use of my data? You can opt out from advertisers using third-party data to target you on LinkedIn by changing your LinkedIn advertising settings . In the Third-party data section of the advertising section of LinkedIn settings, you can change your preferences for the use of third-party data to target you: Go to the Advertising data section of your LinkedIn settings. Click the arrow icon to the right of Data from advertisers . Click the toggle to Off . Please note that preventing the use of third-party data will not opt you out of receiving advertising. If you opt out of the use of third-party data, the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.

From time to time, we may enable access to member data and content for research purposes either through supervised programs such as Economic Graph Research or for other projects conducted by independent researchers. In addition, we may be legally required to grant access to member data and content to third party researchers for research purposes authorized under law. (1) LinkedIn Granted Access to Independent Researchers: When granting access to member data to researchers, we seek to work with bona fide researchers who have no commercial interests in the use of the data and the outcome of their research. We also look to implement the following protections: We require researchers to demonstrate that their research has a goal of enabling economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and/or promoting the interests of society (e.g., online safety). We do not provide access to “private” data or content that may have been provided to LinkedIn (such as payment methods) or shared to a limited audience (such as private messages). In most cases, we will look to limit the data and content that we provide to researchers to public data (data our members choose to make widely available, such as a post to “Anyone”, public profile or comment to a post to “Anyone”). Even then, we may take additional steps to limit the personal data we provide (e.g., by removing direct identifiers such as names or links to actual member profiles associated with public content). We seek to only provide the data and content that is reasonably needed for a given research project. We require a commitment from researchers not to retain data and content any longer than is reasonably necessary and not to disclose the personal data of any individual members. We do not allow outside researchers to experiment or run tests on our members (e.g., engage with you directly on our platform to study your reaction). (2) Legally Required Independent Research Access Under some laws, we may be legally required to grant independent researchers access to member data and/or content. For example, the EU’s Digital Services Act Art. 40 includes a requirement to enable research to public data and content, and in some cases (after authorized by the appropriate EU regulator) “private” data and content.

We don't yet have any member controls to generate your own MITN entries. An algorithm determines whether a news item mentioning a common name like John Smith is about your friend John Smith or a different John Smith. While this algorithm is good, it's not perfect. It's a good idea to check that the person or organization in an article is the same person or organization you're following. If you see any news item associated with the wrong person or organization (or any offensive or inappropriate content in a news item), please report it by clicking the Wrong Person or Wrong Organization flag. News stories about you When our algorithm identifies a news story that mentions you, you'll receive a You Made the News email. This email includes the news stories about you that are shared with your LinkedIn connections and followers, should your privacy settings allow such sharing. If there's an article that's incorrectly associated with you or that you'd like to remove, click Remove Article . If you'd like to share a news article that mentions you more widely, click Share . We can't guarantee that every article about you or a person or organization you follow is picked up. This could be because the name is too common for our system to be confident in the match, the article content is considered objectionable, or the publication (i.e. New York Times) doesn't allow us to pull articles from its site, among other reasons. If you don't want your connections and followers to know when you're mentioned in the news, you can opt out of this feature in your privacy settings . Please note that this option is not available to organizations, and generally we are not able to remove accurate associations to companies or other organizations upon request.

If your ad settings allow, LinkedIn tries to serve you ads off LinkedIn and then provide our advertisers some insights about their ad performance. LinkedIn also seeks to protect the privacy of our members who may have seen or taken an action on an ad served by LinkedIn. LinkedIn can act as an intermediary (known in the industry as “demand side platform” or “DSP”) to help advertisers show ads on a network of other websites and apps. When publishers in this network have space to sell, they send a signal out to bidders, like LinkedIn, and we compare that signal with information we have about members to find a match. Sometimes we use a model graph to estimate whether the signal likely belongs to a LinkedIn member. We also refer to this as a probabilistic (high likelihood) as opposed to deterministic (practically certain) match. In the Designated Countries , we do not collect site or app visit data from third parties (other than, subject to consent, customer sites that installed our Insight Tag) to inform this probabilistic matching model. The signals used to determine matches and inform the model can include: Cookies on a mobile or desktop browser Google Ad ID on Android Operating system, device make and model (User Agent) IP address Time of access (Time Stamp) Page URL or application name, as applicable Hashed emails In addition to using these signals and models to serve you ads off LinkedIn, we also use them to match audiences (e.g. retarget visitors to another site) and provide aggregated ad performance reporting to advertisers without identifying you. Important to know Our technology does not seek to infer interests from data collected off-LinkedIn for any individual we can identify. LinkedIn only personalizes ads for our members. We do not seek to profile non-members, and we also do not create or enhance behavioral profiles of members with off-LinkedIn data (data from advertisers or any third parties), such as by inferring their interests or traits. How long do you retain the collected data? The observation data collected (as described above) is retained for a maximum of 90 days. Data protection policies Data collected by LinkedIn is immediately pseudonymized. Due to our pseudonymization, the model's algorithms can at best learn which devices (and identifiers) likely belong to the same person (or device) or group and not who the individual is. Within LinkedIn, this pseudonymized data in the graph processing line is highly confidential and strict access control policies are enforced. How do I opt out? As a member, you can control our use of data through your ad settings: Measure Ad Success ( attribution (conversion tracking)), Advertiser Data to Show Ads ( retargeting ), and Ads off LinkedIn (to control whether LinkedIn can show you off-LinkedIn ads). In addition, both members and non-members can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page and check the LinkedIn opt-out box.

We’re members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and adhere to the DAA self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising (OBA). Our ad services do not engage in “the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time and across non-affiliate Websites for the purpose of using such data to predict user preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from such Web viewing behaviors.” (OBA, as defined by the DAA Principles) LinkedIn participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies when processing requests to serve ads off-LinkedIn, on the LinkedIn Audience Network. LinkedIn’s identification number within the framework is 804. Use your mobile device settings to opt out of advertising for third parties based on your mobile ad identifier If you’re seeing ads served by LinkedIn for third parties on a non-LinkedIn mobile application, you may use your mobile device settings to opt out of certain types of advertising that use your mobile ad identifier.

Best Practices for Sponsored Content We recommend that LinkedIn Page posts be relevant, short, and authentic. The better your content, the greater the chance that it can go viral through likes, shares, and comments when you sponsor the post. Posts that are perceived as spam will not get shared and could result in your business losing followers. Below are a few things to keep in mind: Sponsored Content with images and video tends to perform better. Keep the headline under 60 characters. Start with a question or quote to hook the reader and use "You" to speak to your audience.

Official Blog Product updates Member stories Creators Trust & safety Product updates Member stories Creators Trust & safety Advance your career Introducing the LinkedIn Workforce Report Authored by Director of Economic Research February 3, 2017      It’s difficult to navigate your career if you aren’t aware of the opportunities and obstacles that lay ahead of you. That’s why we developed the LinkedIn Workforce Report . It’s a new report we’ll publish on a monthly basis that shows you how much hiring is increasing or decreasing across the U.S., cities, and industries; which skills cities need most; and where workers are moving to and from. So for example, hiring across the U.S. in January was 11.4% higher than January 2016. And oil and energy is the industry that had the biggest spike in hiring in January - 23.3% more than January 2016. That means new jobs are opening up. So if your New Year’s resolution is finding a new job, check out LinkedIn Jobs . Plus, lots of people are moving to Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, and Charlotte. Why? All of those cities share two things in common: they’re cheaper to live in than say New York or San Francisco, and they’re a stone’s throw from the great outdoors. These are just a few of the valuable insights the LinkedIn Workforce Report offers that you can use to better navigate your career path. To see all the insights, check out the LinkedIn Jobs Blog .

Official Blog Product updates Member stories Creators Trust & safety Product updates Member stories Creators Trust & safety Trust and safety Sharing LinkedIn’s Responsible AI Principles Authored by SVP and General Counsel at LinkedIn February 22, 2023    Co-authors - Blake Lawit and Ya Xu LinkedIn was founded with a clear vision to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. In 2023, we are seeing transformative advances in AI that have the potential to help us accelerate our progress toward that vision. AI is not new to LinkedIn. LinkedIn has long used AI to enhance our members’ professional experiences. By leveraging the power of AI, we help our members connect, increase productivity and achieve success in their careers. While AI has enormous potential to expand access to opportunity and ultimately transform the world of work in positive ways, the stakes are high. The use of AI comes with risks and potential for harm. That’s why, consistent with our commitment to build a trustworthy platform, we must continue to use AI responsibly. Inspired by, and aligned with, Microsoft’s leadership in Responsible AI, we are sharing the Responsible AI Principles that we use at LinkedIn to guide our work: Advance Economic Opportunity: People are at the center of what we do. AI is a tool to further our vision, empowering our members and augmenting their success and productivity. Uphold Trust: Our commitments to privacy, security and safety guide our use of AI. We take meaningful steps to reduce the potential risks of AI. Promote Fairness and Inclusion: We work to ensure that our use of AI benefits all members fairly, without causing or amplifying unfair bias. Provide Transparency: Understanding of AI starts with transparency. We seek to explain in clear and simple ways how our use of AI impacts people. Embrace Accountability: We deploy robust AI governance, including assessing and addressing potential harms and fitness for purpose, and ensuring human oversight and accountability. We are committed to learning from, and helping, others as AI best practices, norms and laws evolve. Underlying these principles is our commitment to listen and learn about how AI can continue to be a tool to accelerate progress towards economic opportunity for all.

As with most features on LinkedIn, we collect and use (or process) data about your use of the platform, including personal data. This could include your use of the generative AI (AI models used to create content) or other AI features, your posts and articles, how frequently you use LinkedIn, your language preference, and any feedback you may have provided to our teams. We use this data, consistent with our Privacy Policy , to improve or develop the LinkedIn services (see Section 2). Note that we do not currently train content-generating AI models from members located in Canada, the EU, EEA, UK, Switzerland, Hong Kong, or Mainland China. Providing a service to members and customers: Members or customers may provide personal data as an input to a generative AI powered feature, which could result in personal data being provided as an output. For example, if a member used our generative AI ”Writing Suggestions” feature to help write an article about the best advice they got from their mentors, they may include the names of those mentors in the input. The resulting output from the generative AI ”Writing Suggestions” feature may include those names, which that member can edit or revise before deciding to post. Inputs by LinkedIn: Where LinkedIn controls the input for a generative AI powered feature, depending on the feature, we may process your personal data. For example, if you choose to use “Profile Writing Suggestions,” we will use (or process) the relevant data on your profile to generate the suggested text, which you then can review, edit and decide whether to add it to your profile. Another example is when we recommend “Suggested Posts,” we may summarize your post content including any personal data you included in the post. Feedback and Improvement: When you choose to provide feedback for a generative AI powered feature, we may associate your feedback with you and use it to improve or modify our platform and products. Safety, Security and Compliance: We leverage a variety of automated techniques, including generative AI powered tools, as part of our effort to keep our services safe, secure and compliant with our user terms, policies and applicable law. In connection with this important work, we may process personal data, including personal data sourced from our services. Does LinkedIn use (or process) my personal data to train generative AI (GAI)? The artificial intelligence models that LinkedIn uses to power generative AI features may be trained by LinkedIn or another provider. For example, some of our models are provided by Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service . Where LinkedIn trains generative AI models, we seek to minimize personal data in the data sets used to train the models. We also do not currently train content-generating AI models on data from members located in Canada, the EU, EEA, UK, Switzerland, Hong Kong, or Mainland China. Can I opt out of the use of my personal data and the content I create to train LinkedIn’s or its affiliates GAI models? Yes. In regions where LinkedIn or its affiliates use member data to train generative AI models for content creation, you can choose to opt-out of having your personal data and content you create on LinkedIn used for training (including fine-tuning). To opt out, use the Data for Generative AI Improvement member setting . Opting out means that LinkedIn and its affiliates won’t use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train models going forward, but does not affect training that has already taken place. We are initially making this setting available to members whose profile location is outside of Canada, the EU, EEA, UK, Switzerland, Hong Kong, or Mainland China. If you live in these regions, we and our affiliates will not use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train or fine-tune generative AI models for content creation without further notice. In addition to the setting set forth above, members can also object to the use of their personal data for training non-content generating GAI models using the LinkedIn Data Processing Objection Form, accessible here . What personal data is used (or processed) when I use generative AI powered features? Your personal data may be used (or processed) for certain generative AI features on LinkedIn. For example, we process the data that you provide to the generative AI powered feature (e.g. writing suggestions ), or that LinkedIn might create if you use a generative AI powered feature (e.g. profile writing suggestions ). We also use your data in AI features that help you find a job . Like other features on LinkedIn, when you engage with generative AI powered features we process your interactions with the feature, which may include personal data (e.g., your inputs and resulting outputs, your usage information, your language preference, and any feedback you provide). See our Privacy Policy for more information about how we use and process personal data. How long do you store my generative AI (GAI) conversations? When you engage with a generative AI powered feature on LinkedIn, the information you provide and any content that’s generated in response will be stored by LinkedIn until you delete it. If you are looking for past sessions or just want to discover the personal data LinkedIn has about you, you can use our data access tool to review the data we have about your activities on LinkedIn and, should you choose, you can delete or request deletion. Learn more Manage your personal data How can I review my generative AI (GAI) conversations? Depending on the generative AI powered feature, you may be able to view your actions during your session.

Clear Search Input Cancel Clear Search Input  XLNT Platform: Driving A/B Testing at LinkedIn  Ya Xu August 22, 2014   Share Share A/B testing is an indispensable driver behind LinkedIn’s data culture. We run more than 200 experiments in parallel daily and that number is growing quickly. We realized early on that ad hoc testing would only take us so far. We needed to change our approach to allow us to quickly quantify the impact of any A/B test in a scientific and controlled manner across LinkedIn.com and our apps. All of the A/B tests we conduct have a clear end goal of improving our products for the benefit of our members. Like most Internet-based companies, we run experiments that range from small UI tweaks to backend relevance algorithm changes to full redesigns of our homepage. We also have very clear guidelines about what we will not test, which include experiments that are intended to deliver a negative member experience, have a goal of altering members’ moods or emotions, or override existing members’ settings or choices. To take our A/B testing to the next level, we built XLNT, an internal end-to-end A/B testing platform. XLNT allows for easy design and deployment of experiments, but it also provides automatic analysis that is crucial in popularizing A/B tests. The platform is generic and extensible, covering almost all domains including mobile and email. This month, XLNT turns one year old and hits a major milestone: more than 2,800 experiments have run on it. XLNT is a key component of LinkedIn’s Continuous Deployment infrastructure. It allows us to ramp A/B tests totally independently from code releases and can be easily managed through a centralized configuration UI. It also lets us isolate the real impact of the experiment from the noise. The XLNT platform automatically generates analysis reports, including both the percentage delta and the statistical significance information on many metrics, on a daily basis for every A/B test run across LinkedIn.  We continue to build new features into XLNT to enable everyone at LinkedIn to embed A/B testing in their product development and decision-making process. We recognize that not only are our products diverse, each one of our members is special and unique. With that in mind, many of our experiments focus on how we can provide the most improved member experience possible to specific member segments. Now XLNT not only makes such customization simple, but also automatically focuses analysis to isolate the real impact from the noise. In addition, to get accurate assessment of the overall impact of an experiment that is comparable across different experiments with different trigger conditions, XLNT also provides a “site wide impact” estimate to measure how the numbers would move if an experiment were to be launched to 100% of our members. To keep A/B testing scalable as LinkedIn grows, XLNT now lets each team own the logic of their metrics while the experimentation team reviews the metrics definitions, manages the metrics onboarding process and operates daily computations. We’ve made many changes to our products and launched new features after putting them through A/B tests on the XLNT platform. These changes have measurably improved the member experience on LinkedIn. Recently, we ran an A/B test on the small module on members profile pages that guides them to complete their profile. This test focused on the impact of adding the value statement, for example, adding the sentence "Add more color to your professional identity by showing what you care about" with a goal of helping our members understand why they should complete their volunteer experience. This small change turned out to be extremely successful. The A/B test showed a 14% increase in edits of volunteer experience in member profiles! The XLNT platform makes it feasible to quickly test such small changes at low cost to the team, so we can continue to identify features with high Return-On-Investment (ROI) and moreover, quantify the impact in a scientific and controlled manner.  XLNT also makes it extremely easy to test ways we can improve the member experience for customized groups of professionals. Clearly, a job recommendation that works for a CEO is very different from one that works for students. Even for the same member, the need is different when visiting from their computer than from their smartphone. XLNT keeps many targeting attributes in a Voldemort store to query real time for any experiments and, in addition, XLNT is able to process any other attributes that are passed along in the request, e.g. browser, device etc.  The deployment in the application code is as simple as one line. For example, to determine the right color to show to a member in a “buttonColor” experiment, we just need to make one call to the client as shown below. String color = client.getTreatment(memberID, "buttonColor"). Setting up a Multi-variate Test (MVT) simply means creating one call per factor, and the XLNT infrastructure fully supports either full or fractional factorial designs. To enable follow-on analysis, an event is logged during the “getTreatment” call. Logging only when the code is called not only reduces the logs footprint, but also allows us to do triggered analysis where we focus only on users who are actually affected by the experiment. Automated analytics not only saves teams from time-consuming, ad hoc analysis, but also ensures that the methodology behind the reports is solid, consistent and scientifically founded. To paint with a broad brush, the XLNT analytics pipeline runs in Hadoop to compute member engagement metrics such as page-views and clicks, and joins them with the experiment assignment information we collect from online logging. This data is then aggregated to produce summary statistics that are sufficient to compute the impact on any metrics and the statistical significance information such as p-values and confidence intervals. In addition, to provide more insights into why a metric is moved, XLNT supports multiple-level drill down into various member and product segments. The drill-down feature is customized for different product areas to keep the data from exploding and save us from crunching unnecessary data that no one looks at. When we launched XLNT a year ago the platform only supported about 50 tests per day. Today, that number has increased to more than 200 tests. The number of metrics supported has also grown from 60 to more than 700. The XLNT platform now crunches billions of experiment events daily to produce more than 30 million summary records. The team that built and now supports XLNT has a clear mission of enabling “accurate decisions made faster @ scale” and continues to strive to ensure that the best innovations are delivered to our members.

Advertisers may collect and use third-party data to better reach their target audiences on and off LinkedIn. This third-party data may be contact information that you share with third parties or collected when you visit third-party websites. Once collected, advertisers can include this information in their ad campaigns to define and reach a targeted, high-quality audience that is relevant to their business. Please note that LinkedIn does not tell these advertisers who you are. Third-Party data from your interactions with businesses Contact Targeting Contact targeting is a LinkedIn Marketing Solutions feature that allows advertisers to upload lists of contacts to include as part of their target audience for ad campaigns. If you have already interacted with a company and provided them with your name or contact information (e.g. to sign-up for a newsletter or webinar), they may include you in a target audience for a LinkedIn ad campaign using contact targeting. Data Integration Another way advertisers can include contacts in a LinkedIn ad campaign is through data integration with a third-party contact management platform. If an advertiser uses a contact management platform, they may integrate the data collected there with their LinkedIn ad campaign. Please note that with both contact targeting lists and data integrations, LinkedIn only receives hashed contact information from third parties. By applying hashing algorithms to the email addresses or other contacts, the text is rendered unreadable (in other words, LinkedIn does not keep new contact information about its members or anyone else), but it can be used to map advertisers' lists of users to LinkedIn members in order to serve them relevant ads. LinkedIn doesn't disclose to the advertiser the members who see the ads. LinkedIn only provides aggregated data regarding the ad performance. Third-party data from your interactions with websites Website Retargeting Advertisers can also use third-party data from their own company websites for LinkedIn ad campaigns if they enable the LinkedIn Insight Tag on their website. The Insight Tag is JavaScript code that tracks visits of LinkedIn members on third-party sites where the tag is enabled. Advertisers can then use this information about their website visitors to understand their site professional demographics, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns, and they can include their website visitors in audiences for their ad campaigns. Just like with contact targeting, LinkedIn does not identify individual members to advertisers using website retargeting and only reports site professional demographics and ad performance in the aggregate. Also, LinkedIn itself removes members’ direct identifiers within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days. What controls do I have as a LinkedIn member regarding the use of my data? You can opt out from advertisers using third-party data to target you on LinkedIn by changing your LinkedIn advertising settings . In the Third-party data section of the advertising section of LinkedIn settings, you can change your preferences for the use of third-party data to target you: Go to the Advertising data section of your LinkedIn settings. Click the arrow icon to the right of Data from advertisers . Click the toggle to Off . Please note that preventing the use of third-party data will not opt you out of receiving advertising. If you opt out of the use of third-party data, the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.

You can use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and learn aggregate insights about categories of members interacting with your ads. What is needed to install the LinkedIn Insight Tag and how long does it take? The process takes only a few minutes. Add the JavaScript code (unique to your LinkedIn account) to your website. There is no maintenance necessary once the code is in place. Related tasks ﻿ Add the LinkedIn Insight Tag to your website Will this piece of code slow down my website? The LinkedIn Insight Tag was designed to manage speed and complexity. It loads asynchronously with the current website and shouldn't slow down the performance of your website. What data does my website send through this tag and how is it used? The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to your website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. The IP addresses are truncated or hashed (when used for reaching members across devices ), and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days. Regarding the Website Actions feature, learn more about the button layout and engagement data involved. If you enable enhanced matching, you can also send emails associated to the respective visits. Those emails are hashed on the website before being sent to LinkedIn, to protect members’ privacy – we only match information we already have, the rest remains unreadable. Learn more about enhanced matching for your website . We don't share the personal data of members with you; we only provide reports and alerts (which do not identify members) about the professional makeup of your website audience and ad performance. We also provide retargeting for website visitors, enabling you to show personalized ads off your website by using this data, but without identifying the member. We also use data that doesn't identify members to improve ad relevance and reach members across devices . LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings . Does LinkedIn support image pixels? We recommend using our JavaScript tag. If you need a pixel-based solution for conversion tracking, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event to generate a code that can be added to a page or button on your website. Can I track conversions with on-click action (like on a button or in an iframe)? Yes, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event. A code is generated that can be added to a page or button on your website. Please note, buttons that appear on iframes won’t appear on the Website Actions list. Important to know Consistent with our terms , the Insight Tag should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data. This can include pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers. For example, depending on the content of the pages, the Insight Tag may be included on a generic homepage for a pharmacy or a bank, or business-to-business pages directed only to organizations and financial or healthcare professionals, but should not be included on consumer pages for certain types of medications or pages where users manage their financial accounts and transactions or medical appointments, since it could lead to the inadvertent collection and sharing of sensitive information regarding the health or finances of individuals who visited that page. This does not constitute legal advice. Please consult with your webmaster and legal counsel to determine which pages may or may not collect sensitive data.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. Related Companies and Other Services We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our Affiliates , including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services 1.3 Service Use We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps. We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts.

Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account.

You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).

We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Stay Connected Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings , when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have choices about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others.

You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers.

Learn more about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising. Learn more about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners.

We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser.

How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Delete Data : You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Change or Correct Data : You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). Right to Access and/or Take Your Data : You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form. Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests here . You may also contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. Residents in the Designated Countries and the UK , and other regions , may have additional rights under their laws. 4.3 Account Closure We keep some of your data even after you close your account. If you choose to close your LinkedIn account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies ), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache. 4.

Join now Sign in CCPA Annual Metrics: Calendar Year 2023 Effective on June 7, 2024 The CCPA Regulations require that certain businesses disclose annual metrics regarding their responses to certain consumer requests under the CCPA. This notice contains LinkedIn’s CCPA-specific metrics for the 2023 calendar year. In particular, these metrics reflect the number of requests LinkedIn received in which the requester specifically invoked the CCPA. Because LinkedIn offers all its members the ability to exercise the data subject rights listed below without the need to identify the law that authorizes their request, these metrics exclude data regarding the majority of successfully completed requests, such as those achieved using LinkedIn’s automated data download feature or by adjusting their settings . In the calendar year 2023, LinkedIn processed the following number of requests that explicitly invoked the CCPA: CCPA Annual Metrics: Calendar Year 2023  Requests received Complied with in whole Complied with in part Denied Mean days to respond Requests to know (data access) 3 2 0 1 6.7 Requests to delete 20 16 0 4 15.3 Requests to correct 0 0 0 0 0 Requests to opt out of sales N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Requests to opt out of sharing 1 1 0 0 19 Requests to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A  Learn more by reviewing LinkedIn's California Privacy Disclosure .

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier).

We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

You can use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and learn aggregate insights about categories of members interacting with your ads. What is needed to install the LinkedIn Insight Tag and how long does it take? The process takes only a few minutes. Add the JavaScript code (unique to your LinkedIn account) to your website. There is no maintenance necessary once the code is in place. Related tasks ﻿ Add the LinkedIn Insight Tag to your website Will this piece of code slow down my website? The LinkedIn Insight Tag was designed to manage speed and complexity. It loads asynchronously with the current website and shouldn't slow down the performance of your website. What data does my website send through this tag and how is it used? The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to your website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. The IP addresses are truncated or hashed (when used for reaching members across devices ), and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days. Regarding the Website Actions feature, learn more about the button layout and engagement data involved. If you enable enhanced matching, you can also send emails associated to the respective visits. Those emails are hashed on the website before being sent to LinkedIn, to protect members’ privacy – we only match information we already have, the rest remains unreadable. Learn more about enhanced matching for your website . We don't share the personal data of members with you; we only provide reports and alerts (which do not identify members) about the professional makeup of your website audience and ad performance. We also provide retargeting for website visitors, enabling you to show personalized ads off your website by using this data, but without identifying the member. We also use data that doesn't identify members to improve ad relevance and reach members across devices . LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings . Does LinkedIn support image pixels? We recommend using our JavaScript tag. If you need a pixel-based solution for conversion tracking, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event to generate a code that can be added to a page or button on your website. Can I track conversions with on-click action (like on a button or in an iframe)? Yes, you can track Insight Tag conversions by event. A code is generated that can be added to a page or button on your website. Please note, buttons that appear on iframes won’t appear on the Website Actions list. Important to know Consistent with our terms , the Insight Tag should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data. This can include pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers. For example, depending on the content of the pages, the Insight Tag may be included on a generic homepage for a pharmacy or a bank, or business-to-business pages directed only to organizations and financial or healthcare professionals, but should not be included on consumer pages for certain types of medications or pages where users manage their financial accounts and transactions or medical appointments, since it could lead to the inadvertent collection and sharing of sensitive information regarding the health or finances of individuals who visited that page. This does not constitute legal advice. Please consult with your webmaster and legal counsel to determine which pages may or may not collect sensitive data.

We support the following ad formats: Text ads Dynamic ads Sponsored Content ads Create LinkedIn ads with macros LinkedIn macros allow you to generate personalized ad content for each recipient. When you use macros like %FIRSTNAME% or %LASTNAME% during ad creation, the member’s personalized information appears in the ad copy when the campaign is live. Macros are supported for Sponsored Messaging (message and conversation ads), dynamic ads, and conversation assets used in click-to-message ads. Macro functionality When using macros, the text must be in all capital letters. For example, %firstname% won't work as a macro, use %FIRSTNAME% instead. There are two instances where macros won’t function as expected: If a member turns off ad personalization in their privacy settings. If a member doesn’t have an active job position listed in their profile. In both instances, the macro will fail to load and will revert to using generic language. The following table illustrates the text that's used when ad personalization is disabled.

These tables list some of the cookies that we and third parties place. In addition to cookies strictly required for providing our services, they include information about the cookies that LinkedIn uses on third party sites including when LinkedIn’s Insight Tag is installed on our customers sites. The tables also provide information about the cookies that third parties may use to help us to provide our Services.

Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us You provide data to create an account with us. Registration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). Profile You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area , endorsements, and optional verifications of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar. Posting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. 1.2 Data From Others Others may post or write about you. Content and News You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news . Others may sync their calendar with our Services Contact and Calendar Information We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. Partners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. Related Companies and Other Services We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our Affiliates , including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services 1.3 Service Use We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps. We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use. 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more . You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here . 1.5 Your Device and Location We receive data through cookies and similar technologies When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. 1.6 Communications If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use automated systems to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies . 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “ LinkedIn Page ” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your settings , for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a post or LinkedIn Page , to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services. 2.9 Security and Investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others. Social Action E.g. like, comment, follow, share Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others 3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Profile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings , it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our Help Center , your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services , access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings ). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a group , posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings . Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. Subject to your settings , we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Enterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings , when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings , other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services . For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your settings ), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn. 3.4 Related Services We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. Where allowed , we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations). 3.6 Legal Disclosures We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report . 3.7 Change in Control or Sale We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. 3.

Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data : You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

To help ensure that LinkedIn remains safe, trusted, and professional, all members must follow our Professional Community Policies , which outline the types of discussions and content that are permitted on LinkedIn. Members posting jobs must also follow our Jobs Policies . When we find content that doesn’t comply with these policies, we may limit its distribution or remove it. Learn more about how we enforce our policies . LinkedIn uses a three-layer, multidimensional approach to moderate content within our Trust ecosystem. First layer of protection – Automatic and proactive prevention: When a member attempts to create a piece of content on LinkedIn, various calls (or signals) are sent to LinkedIn’s machine learning services. These services aim to automatically filter out certain policy violating content within 300 milliseconds of creation, meaning the content is visible only to the author and is not shown to anyone else on the platform. As part of this process, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role in helping LinkedIn proactively filter out potentially harmful content. LinkedIn uses content (like certain key words or images) that has previously been identified as violating its Professional Community Policies to help inform AI models and better identify and restrict similar content from being posted in the future. LinkedIn measures its preventive defense services regularly to improve accuracy in the filtering process. This is done by sending some positive samples for human review to measure the precision of LinkedIn’s automated defense system. This reduces the likelihood that LinkedIn’s auto-filtering process removes content that complies with LinkedIn’s policies. Second layer of protection – Combination of automatic and human-led detection: LinkedIn’s second layer of moderation detects content that’s likely to be violative but for which the algorithm is not sufficiently confident to warrant automatic removal. This content is flagged by our AI systems for further human review. If the human review team determines that the content violates LinkedIn’s policies, they'll take action on it. LinkedIn’s human review team is instrumental in this process and in helping train the platform’s models. Third layer of protection – Human-led detection: If members locate content they believe violates LinkedIn's policies, we encourage them to report it using the in-product reporting mechanism represented by the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the content itself on LinkedIn. Reported content is then sent to LinkedIn’s team of reviewers for further evaluation and is actioned in accordance with LinkedIn’s policies. Learn more about reporting content .

Set weather Set weather  Back To Main Menu  Close Current   - Mostly Sunny Tonight  Low - Mostly Sunny Tomorrow  High - Mostly Sunny View full weather report Politics Oregon secretary of state candidates cite similar goals but different strategies to restore trust in office Updated: Apr. 26, 2024, 11:28 a.m. | Published: Apr. 25, 2024, 1:06 p.m. | Treasurer Tobias Read and state Sen. James Manning, frontrunners to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, are running on broadly similar platforms and will face off in the May 21 Democratic primary. Courtesy of campaigns By Carlos Fuentes | The Oregonian/OregonLive The frontrunners to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, Treasurer Tobias Read and state Sen. James Manning, are running on broadly similar platforms , saying their top priority is to restore voters’ trust in an office whose last elected leader resigned amid scandal. The two Democrats each point to professional experience they say proves they’re right for the job: Read cites his what he says has been steady, reliable leadership of a complex state agency, the treasury, while Manning points to his decades of service in the U.S. Army, where his work as an inspector general aligned with the audit function of the secretary of state. Both candidates said they would work to protect Oregon’s vote by mail system and ensure the office conducts factual and data-driven audits of state agencies. The winner of the May Democratic primary will be heavily favored heading into the fall general election. Oregon voters have only elected a Republican to serve as secretary of state once since 1985, and Democrats currently hold every statewide elected office. The election will take place just over a year after former Secretary of State Shemia Fagan resigned following Willamette Week’s revelation that she had taken a $10,000 a month consulting gig with an affiliate of embattled marijuana company La Mota while her office was auditing the cannabis industry. Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, whom Gov. Tina Kotek appointed to replace Fagan, is not running. The secretary of state oversees elections, serves as the state’s chief auditor and heads the Oregon Corporation Division. They also sit on the Oregon State Land Board and chair the Oregon Sustainability Board. The elected agency head is first in line to become governor should the state’s top officeholder step down or die. In making their cases to voters, Read has stressed his methodical leadership style while Manning has emphasized his commitment to integrity and public trust. Read represented Beaverton in the Oregon House from 2007 until becoming state treasurer in 2017, rising to the powerful positions of speaker pro tempore and co-chair of the budget committee before announcing his candidacy for statewide office. He said his experience overseeing the state treasury qualifies him to take the reins as secretary of state. If elected, Read said he would explore programs to improve voter access and select which programs and agencies to audit based on data, not politics. “A key part of my administration will be bringing the stability and performance that I’ve led as treasurer to the Secretary of State’s Office,” Read wrote in a response to an Oregonian/OregonLive questionnaire. Read said he recognizes that he is not a flashy candidate but said his understated leadership style would be an asset for an office that has been in turmoil. He previously worked for Nike in product development and marketing roles from 2004 until 2012. During his time in the Legislature, he championed a bill that funded full-day kindergarten. In 2022, Read ran for governor but lost to Kotek by a huge margin in the Democratic primary. Manning, a U.S. Army veteran and state senator since his appointment in late 2016, said one of his priorities in office would be to conduct thorough audits of agencies to address equity-related issues, such as the disproportionate hiring of men and a lack of racial diversity. The secretary of state leads the Oregon Audits Division, which performs regular audits of state agencies and programs to measure their performance and effectiveness. “A reporter once asked me, ‘You do know the secretary of state doesn’t pay a lot?’” Manning wrote in response to The Oregonian/OregonLive’s questionnaire. “I reminded them that serving 24 years active duty in the U.S. Army didn’t pay a lot either. I do it for the love of country and because it is public service.” State Sen. James Manning, candidate to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, says his military career and legislative experience has prepared him to take on the statewide office. Courtesy of James Manning campaign Manning said his experience as an assistant inspector general in the Army for three years and as the state Senate’s president pro tempore since 2021 have given him valuable experience. Manning retired from the Army in 2007 and moved to Eugene, where he served on nonprofit boards and school and local commissions, including six years as a member of the Eugene police commission, before joining the Legislature. He also served on Oregon’s Commission on Black Affairs from 2013 to 2017. Read has brought in more than triple the campaign contributions of Manning. Manning has raised just over $200,000 and spent about $190,000. He’s received $13,600 from advocacy organization Imagine Black; and $5,000 apiece from the political arm of the Native American Youth and Family Center, Oregon AFSCME, manufacturing company Greenhill Reload, real estate company ATR Services and political strategist Johnell Bell. He also had received $20,000 from Stuart Barr, the owner of Eugene-based manufacturing company Industrial Finishes who has supported pro-life causes. However, campaign finance records show Manning returned the donation Wednesday. Willamette Week reported that Manning returned the donation after speaking with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon Executive Director Samantha Gladu. Manning did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the returned donation. “Sen. Manning’s campaign for secretary of state is about inclusion and bringing people together. He embraces diverse opinions and people from different walks of life who may not agree on every issue,” wrote Matt Keating, a spokesperson for Manning’s campaign, in an email. “While he welcomes support from a wide array of viewpoints, Sen. Manning’s values are consistent and his support for access to abortion and the full spectrum of reproductive health care services is unwavering.” Read has brought in roughly $635,000 and spent about $234,000. The Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association gave him $26,250. Five other groups or individuals contributed $25,000: an Oregon electricians union; Gideon Yu, co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers and former CFO of Facebook; Eugene-based construction equipment company The Pape Group; Springboard Group, a Lake Oswego-based nonprofit that focuses on Yamhill County economic well-being and gives widely to political candidates; and Avamere Health Services, a senior health care and nursing home provider. Dozens of lawmakers and notable Oregon politicians have endorsed a candidate in the race. Manning has received endorsements from 20 Democratic state lawmakers, the Oregon Sierra Club and the Oregon chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Read has received endorsements from 10 Democratic state lawmakers, former governors Barbara Roberts, Ted Kulongoski and John Kitzhaber, U.S. Reps. Suzanne Bonamici, Val Hoyle and Andrea Salinas, the Oregon Education Association and former Secretaries of State Jeanne Atkins and Phil Keisling. Oregon Planned Parenthood and the Oregon chapter of the Service Employees International Union endorsed both Manning and Read. Former attorney James Crary, retired attorney and former securities analyst Dave Stauffer and retired electrical engineer Paul Wells are also vying for the Democratic nomination. In response to a questionnaire from The Oregonian/OregonLive, Crary said he would focus on data and software audits to minimize agencies’ security risks and establish an electronic candidate forum, which voters could access to directly contact political candidates. If elected, Stauffer said he would work to fight misinformation and take his role of chief auditor seriously. Wells declined to respond to the candidate questionnaire. The three Republicans competing for their party’s bid are state Sen. Dennis Linthicum, who cannot seek reelection to the Senate this year because of his participation in a Republican-led walkout of the Senate in 2023, small business owner Brent Barker and business analyst Tim McCloud. McCloud has not held office and unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022. Barker also has not held office and unsuccessfully ran for labor commissioner in 2022. All Republican candidates said they would attempt to end Oregon’s vote-by-mail system, if elected. Linthicum and McCloud said they believe voter fraud has impacted state and federal election results in recent years. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud at the state or federal level. Plans to oversee audits, fight misinformation If elected, Manning said he would lead the office by example and reduce corruption by setting an office-wide expectation of transparency. He said he would demand audits of state agencies with known problems, such as the Oregon Employment Department, which continues to struggle with long wait times and slow claims processing amid a transition to a new computer system. Read said he would focus on protecting Oregonians’ right to vote and providing sufficient support to staff to ensure that audits are carefully selected and done with the right intentions. He said audits should not be driven “by a particular agenda, but by efficiency and effectiveness.” State Treasurer Tobias Read said his experience overseeing the state treasury qualifies him to take the reins as secretary of state. Courtesy of Tobias Read campaign One major task for the next secretary of state will be implementing historic limits on political contributions that lawmakers approved earlier this year. The new law calls for the Secretary of State’s Office to create a comprehensive dashboard to track campaign contributions and overhaul Orestar, Oregon’s online campaign finance reporting and disclosure system. Griffin-Valade told lawmakers earlier this year that the office will need more staff and money to get the job done. Both Manning and Read said they support the desire of voters to limit political contributions and would ensure the bill is successfully carried out. Manning said he would seek long-term funding to support the overhaul of Orestar and “look to the some 36 states that have implemented [campaign finance reform] and propose best practices in regards to administration and guardrails to ensure bad actors are reigned in.” Read said his experience rolling out complicated laws at the state treasury has prepared him to take on such a major task. Read has overseen the implementation of programs such as retirement-oriented OregonSaves, a system he advocated for while in the Legislature, and Oregon’s unclaimed property program. “I will immediately roll up my sleeves, assess the capacity of the office and develop plans for implementation. My team and I know how to do this,” Read wrote. “I’m confident that with the appropriate budget and staffing, we will ensure the on-time rollout of a new transparent, publicly-accessible way for Oregonians to view campaign finance data.” As the state’s chief elections officer, Manning said he would work to expand voters’ access to the ballot and protect Oregon’s voting system, but he did not outline specific strategies to do so. In the Legislature, he introduced or supported several bills to enhance voter access, such as a bill that died in a legislative committee this year that would have automatically registered college students to vote upon their enrollment. “Oregon boasts the highest turnout in the nation yet we still have thousands of eligible students who remain unregistered as they are slipping through our ... automatic voter registration systems,” Manning said. If elected, Manning said he would conduct listening sessions at county election offices around the state to discuss ways to protect Oregon’s voting system and combat misinformation. To improve Oregon’s voting system, Read said he would explore programs to increase voters’ confidence, such as establishing a statewide program that would text voters when their ballots are received and their votes counted and a program that would allow voters to see ballot-counting firsthand. “Over the past six months, I have met with 24 of Oregon’s 36 county clerks to hear in part about strategies they have used to reach more voters, including satellite voting centers, increased translation services, ballot notification and outreach to rural voters in accessible locations,” Read said. To combat misinformation, both Read and Manning said they would enhance transparency in the state’s voting system and invest in safety protocols for election workers. Read said he would do that “by not being afraid to stand up to misinformation campaigns and proving my commitment to transparency. I would also add that the safety of our election workers are under increasing threats, and I will be aggressive in protecting them.” Manning said he would fight misinformation “through public service announcements and operating transparently in the office of secretary of state. ... I will ensure investments are made in civics and in security, training and information delivery to and from our elections offices across our state.” Oregon’s secretary of state has often taken on the additional task of redrawing the state’s congressional and legislative district boundaries after decennial census results come in. Similar to many other states, Oregon allows lawmakers to decide changes to its district boundaries, which they last redrew in 2021. However, lawmakers have only twice in the last century been able to approve new district boundaries, otherwise leaving the job to the secretary of state. Good government groups have long advocated for an independent redistricting commission, arguing that Democrats as the legislative majority in 2021 redrew congressional districts in a way that gave them an unfair advantage, known as gerrymandering. A proposed ballot measure to create an independent redistricting commission was tabled earlier this year. Read said he is open to the idea of establishing an independent commission, but he pointed out that independent panels of judges have consistently upheld redrawn boundaries decided by the Legislature or former secretary of states. He said, “I am not confident that any one system — an independent commission among them — represents a magic bullet.” Manning said he likes the current system because lawmakers are fully accountable to voters and represent Oregon’s population better than an independent commission would. “An unintended consequence of a so-called ‘independent commission’ appointed by lawmakers or the executive branch may be a way of removing accountability,” Manning said. “In a representative democracy, I find it appropriate that legislators are directly accountable to the people they represent.” — Carlos Fuentes covers state politics and government.

Treasurer Tobias Read and state Sen. James Manning, frontrunners to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, are running on broadly similar platforms and will face off in the May 21 Democratic primary. Courtesy of campaigns Courtesy of campaigns    By Carlos Fuentes | The Oregonian/OregonLive The frontrunners to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, Treasurer Tobias Read and state Sen. James Manning, are running on broadly similar platforms , saying their top priority is to restore voters’ trust in an office whose last elected leader resigned amid scandal. The two Democrats each point to professional experience they say proves they’re right for the job: Read cites his what he says has been steady, reliable leadership of a complex state agency, the treasury, while Manning points to his decades of service in the U.S. Army, where his work as an inspector general aligned with the audit function of the secretary of state. Both candidates said they would work to protect Oregon’s vote by mail system and ensure the office conducts factual and data-driven audits of state agencies. The winner of the May Democratic primary will be heavily favored heading into the fall general election. Oregon voters have only elected a Republican to serve as secretary of state once since 1985, and Democrats currently hold every statewide elected office. The election will take place just over a year after former Secretary of State Shemia Fagan resigned following Willamette Week’s revelation that she had taken a $10,000 a month consulting gig with an affiliate of embattled marijuana company La Mota while her office was auditing the cannabis industry. Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, whom Gov. Tina Kotek appointed to replace Fagan, is not running. The secretary of state oversees elections, serves as the state’s chief auditor and heads the Oregon Corporation Division. They also sit on the Oregon State Land Board and chair the Oregon Sustainability Board. The elected agency head is first in line to become governor should the state’s top officeholder step down or die. In making their cases to voters, Read has stressed his methodical leadership style while Manning has emphasized his commitment to integrity and public trust. Read represented Beaverton in the Oregon House from 2007 until becoming state treasurer in 2017, rising to the powerful positions of speaker pro tempore and co-chair of the budget committee before announcing his candidacy for statewide office. He said his experience overseeing the state treasury qualifies him to take the reins as secretary of state. If elected, Read said he would explore programs to improve voter access and select which programs and agencies to audit based on data, not politics. “A key part of my administration will be bringing the stability and performance that I’ve led as treasurer to the Secretary of State’s Office,” Read wrote in a response to an Oregonian/OregonLive questionnaire. Read said he recognizes that he is not a flashy candidate but said his understated leadership style would be an asset for an office that has been in turmoil. He previously worked for Nike in product development and marketing roles from 2004 until 2012. During his time in the Legislature, he championed a bill that funded full-day kindergarten. In 2022, Read ran for governor but lost to Kotek by a huge margin in the Democratic primary. Manning, a U.S. Army veteran and state senator since his appointment in late 2016, said one of his priorities in office would be to conduct thorough audits of agencies to address equity-related issues, such as the disproportionate hiring of men and a lack of racial diversity. The secretary of state leads the Oregon Audits Division, which performs regular audits of state agencies and programs to measure their performance and effectiveness. “A reporter once asked me, ‘You do know the secretary of state doesn’t pay a lot?’” Manning wrote in response to The Oregonian/OregonLive’s questionnaire. “I reminded them that serving 24 years active duty in the U.S. Army didn’t pay a lot either. I do it for the love of country and because it is public service.” State Sen. James Manning, candidate to become Oregon’s next secretary of state, says his military career and legislative experience has prepared him to take on the statewide office. Courtesy of James Manning campaign Courtesy of James Manning campaign Manning said his experience as an assistant inspector general in the Army for three years and as the state Senate’s president pro tempore since 2021 have given him valuable experience. Manning retired from the Army in 2007 and moved to Eugene, where he served on nonprofit boards and school and local commissions, including six years as a member of the Eugene police commission, before joining the Legislature. He also served on Oregon’s Commission on Black Affairs from 2013 to 2017. Read has brought in more than triple the campaign contributions of Manning. Manning has raised just over $200,000 and spent about $190,000. He’s received $13,600 from advocacy organization Imagine Black; and $5,000 apiece from the political arm of the Native American Youth and Family Center, Oregon AFSCME, manufacturing company Greenhill Reload, real estate company ATR Services and political strategist Johnell Bell. He also had received $20,000 from Stuart Barr, the owner of Eugene-based manufacturing company Industrial Finishes who has supported pro-life causes.
