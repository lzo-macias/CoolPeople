This includes advocating for equitable funding and resources across all schools, especially those in underrepresented communities. Create universal, high quality childcare New York City is losing families because they cannot afford to raise their children in the city. New York City families, on average, spend about a quarter of their income on childcare, and a family would need to make $300,000 per year to have childcare be deemed “affordable” by federal standards. Moreover, childcare workers are currently not paid fair wages, with one in four childcare workers in NYC living in poverty. As a councilmember, Edafe will work with state legislators to create universal access to childcare in New York City. Providing universal childcare is not just the right thing to do - it also will benefit New York, which loses over $23 billion a year from lost economic activity due to parents leaving the city or being forced to take time off of work. Address staffing shortages in special education and raise para pay Paraprofessional pay in New York starts at an abysmal $28,000. This has led to 1,400 paraprofessional vacancies in our school. There are an additional 2,300+ special education teacher vacancies. All of this leads to thousands of students not getting the services they are legally entitled to and costs the city hundreds of millions of dollars when parents make claims against the city. Edafe will fight against education budget cuts–like those in 2022 that led to $300 million less for our students. Edafe will raise pay for paraprofessionals and provide additional compensation for teachers to become dual-certified special education teachers. Work with the community on school relocations and mergers As the population of New York City changes, our district has had many school relocated, shut down, or merged with other schools. These mergers and closures create disruptions for our communities, our families, and our school personnel. But these changes frequently happen without consulting the people they impact.  As a city councilmember, Edafe will support schools in our district to make sure they can sustain enrollment, and he will work with community members to minimize the disruption to students’ lives. Work with state lawmakers to reformulate the foundation aid formula A recent report by the Rockefeller Institute exposed how the state’s Foundation Aid Formula–which determines state aid to public schools–needs drastic overhaul. Edafe will work with state legislators to increase state funding to our public schools by making sure that the state adequately supports students who are experiencing homelessness and poverty.

Edafe Okporo’s platform centers on expanding access to health services, protecting retirees' healthcare, and ensuring New Yorkers receive equitable care, especially in light of climate risks and public health challenges. He recognizes the importance of addressing the city’s growing mental health crisis and advocates for comprehensive mental health services as part of his vision for a healthier and more supportive New York City. Protect retirees’ healthcare Over the past five years, New York City has been trying to move public service retirees onto a cost-cutting Medicare Advantage plan. Nearly one in five older New Yorkers lives in poverty, and cutting their access to healthcare–especially for those who served our city for decades–is unethical. Edafe will co-sponsor Intro-1096-2024, which would prevent the city from diminishing retirees’ benefits once and for all. Edafe will work with union leaders to ensure that future pay increases are not predicated on cuts to healthcare. Increase funding for resources for older adults One in five New Yorkers are 65 or older–but  NYC Aging’s budget only represents 0.5% of the city’s budget. Moreover, NYC Aging is facing an $80 million shortfall in 2026 when federal stimulus funding expires. New York needs to drastically increase its investment in the Department for the Aging, increasing pay for caseworkers and addressing food insecurity; as many as 50% of older adults receiving food from Citymeals on Wheels still face food insecurity. As a city councilmember, Edafe would support Intro 0770-2024 that would provide 365 days per year home-delivered meals and Intro 0237-2024 that would provide grab-and-go meals for older adults. Healthcare and Older Adults Healthcare and Older Adults Healthcare and Older Adults NYC older adults and public service retirees deserve affordable, accessible, and reliable health care—not fear and uncertainty.

As the former director of the first shelter for asylum seekers in New York City, he has seen the impact of housing insecurity and has been at the forefront of advocating for those in need. His commitment to expanding affordable housing isn’t just a campaign promise—it’s a continuation of the work he’s dedicated his life to. Creating housing that is truly affordable While the City of Yes was a good start for creating more housing across New York City, we cannot build our way out of the affordability crisis. District 7 is already one of the densest parts of the city, and in 2023, District 7 only created 87 new units of affordable housing. More luxury developments with limited public housing in our neighborhood–like a recently approved building at 135th street–will not fix our housing crisis. Edafe wants to massively invest in existing social housing programs like Open Doors and Neighborhood Pillars to create more limited equity cooperatives like HDFCs and Mitchell-Lamas and to preserve existing affordable units - thousands of which in our district will expire over the next five years. Make Columbia pay its fair share Columbia and NYU are two of the city’s biggest landowners, at more than 320 properties worth over $4 billion–yet they pay very little in property taxes. As Columbia continues to expand into Harlem, it removes more and more properties from the city’s tax base while driving up the cost of housing. The Community Benefits Agreement offered by Columbia in 2009 ($170 million over 36 years) is just a fraction of the amount of savings it receives from tax exemptions as Manhattan’s largest landlord. Columbia commits less than $5 million annually to the West Harlem Development Corporation, but it receives over $180 million annually in tax exemptions. Edafe will push for a re-negotiation of the Community Benefits Agreement, including a drastic increase in the amount allocated to affordable housing, which currently only sits at $1.5 million per year. In order to bring Columbia to the negotiating table, Edafe will work with state legislators to tax Columbia and NYU’s real estate holdings—which could generate over $300 million in revenue for the city—and end Columbia’s use of eminent domain. Fully invest in NYCHA Over half a million people live in NYCHA, and another 200,000 people are on a waiting list. Despite NYCHA’s importance in providing affordable housing for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, though, it has been underfunded for decades, leading to a $80 billion backlog in needed repairs–including nearly $3 billion in District 7. In order to make substantial progress. Edafe is calling for New York City to increase its investment in capital funding for NYCHA by 50% to $1.5 billion per year. Over the past several years, NYCHA buildings have been increasingly run by private management companies, which evict residents at a significantly higher rate than traditional NYCHA housing. Edafe will fight against the privatization of public housing to ensure that residents can stay in their homes. Strengthen the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) SCRIE–which freezes rent for low and middle income older residents–has been one of the most successful housing programs in the city, with about 70,000 older New Yorkers participating in it every year. But about 45% of eligible residents don’t participate in the program. Because SCRIE freezes rent at the time of application, applying as soon as possible ensures that you can save more money. As a councilmember, Edafe will dedicate a staff member to be a liaison for older residents, helping to advertise SCRIE and make sure those who are eligible sign up promptly. Even under SCRIE, however, many older New Yorkers are paying more than half of the income on rent. Edafe will fight to have SCRIE freeze rents for older New Yorkers at no more than one-third of their income on rent. Let’s build a future where every New Yorker has a place to call home.

Edafe will fight against the privatization of public housing to ensure that residents can stay in their homes. Strengthen the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) SCRIE–which freezes rent for low and middle income older residents–has been one of the most successful housing programs in the city, with about 70,000 older New Yorkers participating in it every year. But about 45% of eligible residents don’t participate in the program. Because SCRIE freezes rent at the time of application, applying as soon as possible ensures that you can save more money. As a councilmember, Edafe will dedicate a staff member to be a liaison for older residents, helping to advertise SCRIE and make sure those who are eligible sign up promptly. Even under SCRIE, however, many older New Yorkers are paying more than half of the income on rent. Edafe will fight to have SCRIE freeze rents for older New Yorkers at no more than one-third of their income on rent.

Drawing from his personal and professional experiences, Edafe knows that addressing the root causes of crime—poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and social inequities—is essential to creating a safer community. But that doesn’t mean we can simply ignore the problem. We must take bold action to end street homelessness, help those in crisis, and invest in solutions that work—while allowing police to focus on violent crime. Invest in proven solutions like Mental Health Courts and Intensive Mobile Treatment units New York City spends over $500,000 per year incarcerating someone at Riker’s Island–yet crime in the city remains stubborn. Half of New York City’s jail population suffers from mental illness, and many of the most severe crimes we have seen in recent years have come from those suffering from severe mental illness–and these people are the most likely to wind up back in jail. Edafe will fight to expand programs like mental health courts, which connect participants with support from mental health providers, employers, and other resources before they are released. The mental health court program has been shown to reduce recidivism by nearly 50%. Using Intensive Mobile Treatment units, the city can also address those living on the street by forming trusting relationships with them to get them the help that they need. But outreach teams supervised by the Adams administration have been riddled with a lack of accountability and oversight, leading to wasted money and low efficacy. Edafe will use his oversight powers and background in working with the homeless to increase accountability for outside organizations that the city contracts with, while increasing resources available to these teams. Housing First Approach 130,000 people in New York City are homeless–including 45,000 children and 4,000 people sleeping on the street. The city’s sweeps of homeless encampments, while well-intentioned, will not address our long-term problems; 0.1% of people who were caught up in the city’s homeless sweeps have found stable housing. We already know that supportive housing–which provides residents access to healthcare, social workers, and other services–is the most effective way to keep people off of the streets. A housing first pilot targeting homeless veterans in New York City has almost eliminated veteran homelessness. And it is more cost-effective: supportive housing costs half as much as a shelter; it is just 5% of the cost of incarcerating someone on Riker’s Island, and it is less than 2% of the cost of hospitalizing someone. Mandatory Co-Responder Model Edafe will help to create a co-responder model for the NYPD, where police officers collaborate with social workers or mental health clinicians to respond jointly to behavioral health crises and other complex situations. Through the co-responder model, New York can both reduce the use of jails while still addressing safety concerns. This approach has been shown to improve outcomes for individuals in crisis in places like Denver and Fairfax County while reducing the strain on law enforcement and healthcare systems.

And in 2023, there were 23 fatal e-bike crashes. One of the largest sources of e-bikes on NYC streets are delivery companies, who pressure deliveristas to make deliveries at breakneck speeds. As a councilmember, Edafe will introduce legislation to require delivery companies to provide and license bikes for their drivers and insure their deliveristas. Under such a plan delivery companies themselves would be fined for reckless driver behavior incentivizing companies to prioritize deliverista and pedestrian safety and preventing deliveristas from being unnecessarily criminalized. Regulate CitiBike’s electric assist bicycles As a city councilmember, Edafe would sign onto Gale Brewer’s Intro 1145-2024, requiring Citibike to install speedometers of e-bikes and limiting electric assistance for new users. Fulfill the city’s commitment to bus lanes and bike lanes Only 3% of city streets have bike lanes. Creating more bike lanes will reduce cyclists on sidewalks and will make bike traffic more predictable. It also reduces New York City’s dependence on cars, helping New York to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The city, however, is behind on its goals: The city only built 32 miles of 50 miles of promised bike lanes in 2023. Improving bus lanes in New York will also help make our city more affordable. Bus riders are predominantly lower income, and 55% of bus riders are immigrants. Our current administration, however, has not been meeting its obligations. As part of the Streets Master Plan, NYC is supposed to be adding 30 new miles of bus lanes every year. Instead, in 2024, NYC is on pace to build just 5.3 miles of bus lanes–the fewest bus lanes the city has built in 6 years. As a councilmember, Edafe will use his oversight power to ensure that the city is meeting its commitments to reliable, clean public transportation. Create self-enforcing streets Currently, only 1% of intersections in New York City have cameras. New York City can generate millions of dollars in revenue while improving safety by expanding the use of red light and speed cameras. The city should also look at creative solutions to making intersections safer through raised crosswalks, which half already made streets in Manhattan safer. Expand fair fares One of the easiest ways the city can help to make New York more affordable is by further subsidizing the Fair Fares program–which provides free and discounted MTA fairs for low-income New Yorkers–and cutting red tape for enrollment. This would also reduce fare evasion and would save the city money (the NYPD spent over $150 million in 2023 to recover $104,000 in evaded fares). Raise the Fair Fares income eligibility threshold to 200% of the poverty level. Automatically enroll people qualifying for other programs, like SNAP. By increasing the number of people who are eligible for fair fares, we can also ensure that NYPD is able to focus on subway safety, rather than fare evasion.

As a councilmember, Edafe will introduce legislation to require delivery companies to provide and license bikes for their drivers and insure their deliveristas. Under such a plan delivery companies themselves would be fined for reckless driver behavior incentivizing companies to prioritize deliverista and pedestrian safety and preventing deliveristas from being unnecessarily criminalized.

Fulfill the city’s commitment to bus lanes and bike lanes Only 3% of city streets have bike lanes. Creating more bike lanes will reduce cyclists on sidewalks and will make bike traffic more predictable. It also reduces New York City’s dependence on cars, helping New York to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The city, however, is behind on its goals: The city only built 32 miles of 50 miles of promised bike lanes in 2023. Improving bus lanes in New York will also help make our city more affordable. Bus riders are predominantly lower income, and 55% of bus riders are immigrants. Our current administration, however, has not been meeting its obligations. As part of the Streets Master Plan, NYC is supposed to be adding 30 new miles of bus lanes every year. Instead, in 2024, NYC is on pace to build just 5.3 miles of bus lanes–the fewest bus lanes the city has built in 6 years. As a councilmember, Edafe will use his oversight power to ensure that the city is meeting its commitments to reliable, clean public transportation.

Create self-enforcing streets Currently, only 1% of intersections in New York City have cameras. New York City can generate millions of dollars in revenue while improving safety by expanding the use of red light and speed cameras. The city should also look at creative solutions to making intersections safer through raised crosswalks, which half already made streets in Manhattan safer.

The city should also look at creative solutions to making intersections safer through raised crosswalks, which half already made streets in Manhattan safer. Expand fair fares One of the easiest ways the city can help to make New York more affordable is by further subsidizing the Fair Fares program–which provides free and discounted MTA fairs for low-income New Yorkers–and cutting red tape for enrollment. This would also reduce fare evasion and would save the city money (the NYPD spent over $150 million in 2023 to recover $104,000 in evaded fares). Raise the Fair Fares income eligibility threshold to 200% of the poverty level. Automatically enroll people qualifying for other programs, like SNAP. By increasing the number of people who are eligible for fair fares, we can also ensure that NYPD is able to focus on subway safety, rather than fare evasion.

Edafe Okporo Welcome to the "Speaking" page of my website! As a gay asylum seeker, I understand the challenges of displacement, marginalization, and xenophobia that many people face in their pursuit of the American dream. However, I have since gone on to build a successful career in Human Resources, focusing on systems in the workplace and society at large. A REFUGEE JOURNEY OF FINDING HOME The Promise of America is that everyone has the opportunity to belong and build a life for themselves and future generations. But to actualize this vision, we must create a society where the most vulnerable among us have a sense of belonging. Through my work, I share the stories of refugees, asylum seekers, and displaced persons who have fled their homes in search of safety. I believe that we can create a society that is a bridge to all, where everyone has a sense of belonging, and a home is a place of joy. As a survivor of trauma, I know the importance of creating psychological safety in the workplace, especially for LGBTQ people, refugees, and minorities. I share tips on coming out in the workplace and creating an environment of inclusivity and acceptance. My ability to combine substance with storytelling has made me a sought-after guest speaker. For example, I was invited to speak at Grindr, where I helped increase their internal competency around app users in countries where homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia make it dangerous to be oneself. I look forward to finding additional ways to work with organizations in creating a more inclusive and equitable society. “ ” “ ” My interview on ABC News Keynote Speaker Request Form Thank you for considering me as a speaker for your event.
