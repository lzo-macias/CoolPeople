Privacy of Information These Terms include our privacy policy , which describes how we use your personal information. By using this Website, you acknowledge that we will receive certain personal information, and that you are voluntarily providing this information to us. We will not rent, sell or otherwise make available to any third party any information that identifies you or contributions you make, other than to the Campaign to which you are contributing, or to process your contribution, or to comply with applicable law, rules or regulations, including the requirement that we post contributor names, employers, occupations, and the amount of their contributions on the CFB website. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Your information will be shared with both the Campaign to which you are contributing and with us, just as it would be if you made a credit or debit card contribution directly to the Campaign at a Campaign event using a credit card reader or similar device or by using the Campaign’s website. Access to Other Information The Website maintains records containing personal information about contributors, or information that can be identified or associated with a particular contributor, for the purposes of providing public disclosure, as part of the CFB’s routine business as an agency of the City of New York, in furtherance of its missions and duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York. Examples of this information include the name of the Campaign receiving the contribution, a contributor’s address, employer, or occupation, and the amount of the contributor’s contribution. To the extent these records contain information that is not considered confidential, such information may be disclosed to the public, posted on the CFB website, or made available to the campaign through Website as part of the contribution information. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Credit card transaction information may be stored by the Campaign’s payment processor. Security To process your contribution securely, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a security protocol that provides data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity for connections to the Internet, to ensure that Account numbers and personal data you provide by using the Website are not transmitted over the Internet unencrypted and cannot be viewed by unauthorized individuals. Using the Website Contribute is an Internet-based service that allows you to make contributions to a Campaign via the Internet using your credit or debit card. By using the Website you instruct Stripe, the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to debit or charge your Account, which allows your contribution to be forwarded to the Campaign, based on the Campaign’s agreement with its payment processor and the contribution instructions you provide on the Website, subject to this Agreement. In order to use the Website, you must provide all requested information. Because federal law prohibits contributions by foreign nationals, you must be a United States citizen or a green card holder. The contribution must be made in U.S. dollars and is not tax-deductible.  The contribution must be made from your own funds and not from funds provided to you by another person or entity. The Account must be your own and must be a personal account, not a business account. You authorize the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to electronically order the Financial Institution to debit (i.e., make a charge against) your Account in the amount you specify and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, to your Account as may be necessary to make the contribution and to correct any error. Your Account will show a separate transaction for the contribution to the Campaign. Once you complete a transaction on the Website, your authorization to debit or charge your Account for this specific contribution shall remain in full force. Your contribution is considered approved when you receive an online confirmation. In Case of Errors or Questions about Your Contribution If you dispute anything related to how your contribution was processed, you must contact the Campaign. You agree to contact the Campaign as soon as possible if you believe that an error has occurred, or if there has been unauthorized use of your Account. Using this system does not guarantee or improve the chances of a Campaign receiving public funds through the Campaign Finance Program. We are not responsible for any Website, vendor, third-party, contributor, or campaign errors that might make a particular contribution ineligible for public matching funds pursuant to the New York City Campaign Finance Program. Limits on Use You must be the person authorized to make a contribution using the credit or debit card information provided to the Campaign on the Website. You agree not to use the Website in an amount that will exceed the funds or available credit line in your Account. If you do, the Campaign has no obligation to complete the transaction and you agree that the Campaign may debit your Account for its payment processor’s returned item fee or other similar fee. Your use of your Account may be limited by your agreement with your Financial Institution and by applicable law. Neither the Campaign nor the CFB is responsible for not completing a transaction as a result of any such limit on your Account and are not responsible if your Financial Institution fails to honor any charge or debit against your Account. At the Campaign’s payment processor’s sole discretion, it may refuse to complete any transaction, which it has reason to believe is not made by you, may violate any law, rule or regulation, or if it has reasonable cause not to honor it. Communications/Verifications Communications to us via the Website or the Contribute email address shall in no way be deemed to constitute legal or official notice to the CFB, or the City of New York, its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents with respect to any existing, pending or future claim or cause of action against the CFB or the City of New York or any of its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents where notice is required by federal, state, or local law.

We ask all Website users to use appropriate names and language in the name spaces, address spaces and other spaces (if any) provided on the Website. Users are prohibited from using false email addresses. Governing Law This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the City and State of New York (notwithstanding New York choice of law or conflict of law principles), and the laws of the United States, where applicable. Jurisdiction You agree that any and all claims asserted by or against the CFB or the City of New York arising under or related to this Agreement or your use of the Website shall solely be heard and determined either in the courts of the United States located in the City or in the courts of the State located in the City and County of New York. You further agree that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement, or your use of the Website, shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York. Amendments We may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time. In such event, we will post the amended Terms and Conditions on the Website. Liability Should you choose to terminate or discontinue your use of the Website, you shall nonetheless remain liable for all amounts you contributed using the Website. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that the Campaign’s payment processor may incur in order to collect any amounts you owe under these Terms and Conditions.

platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (“the Website”) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically

with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New York’s Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFB’s work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFB’s work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

The CFB may choose to stop offering Contribute, or any particular portion of Contribute, or modify or replace any aspect of Contribute, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to Contribute, where, in the CFB's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you.

Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections? Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results? The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day. However, these results will not include any absentee ballot votes. After they receive all absentee ballots, they will finish counting and release certified final results. You can find election results at the NYC Board of Elections website. Visit the Board of Elections website Vote by Mail Back to Top Can I still vote in person if I request or submit an absentee ballot? If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Learn more about voting by mail Can I drop off my absentee ballot at my poll site? Yes! You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any NYC poll site. Ballot boxes will be available at the front desk. You can also drop off your ballot at any Board of Elections office . You do not need postage if you are dropping off your ballot. Learn more about voting by mail Can I track my absentee ballot after I return it? Yes! The Board of Elections’ ballot tracker will let you know the status of your ballot after you submit a request. It will also let you know if they have received your completed ballot and whether it’s valid. Track your ballot Can I fix my absentee ballot if I made a mistake? The Board of Elections is required by law to notify you if there is a curable error on your ballot envelope, such as a missing or incorrect signature. If there is a fixable error on your ballot, they will contact you by mail, email, and phone (if available) within 1 day of discovering the error. You will then have a minimum of 5 days to correct the error by returning a signed affirmation. Learn more about voting by mail Can I vote absentee in person? Sounds strange, but it’s true! You can vote absentee in person at your borough’s Board of Elections office. Offices are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, and on the weekend prior to Election Day. This can be a helpful option if you miss the deadline to request a ballot online or by mail. On Election Day offices are open until 9pm. Find your local Board of Elections office Can I join a permanent absentee ballot list? Yes!

Just like on Election Day, you can visit your early voting site any time polls are open. Find your poll site Election Day Back to Top Where do I vote on Election Day?

Find your poll site Can I vote on Election Day if I requested or submitted an absentee ballot? Yes! If you vote in person after requesting or submitting an absentee ballot, your absentee ballot is automatically disqualified. Only your in person vote will count. You do not need to bring your absentee ballot to your poll site. Learn more about Election Day If I’m in line at my poll site when polls close, can I still vote? Yes! You have the right to vote as long as you are a registered voter in line by 9pm on Election Day. Learn more about Election Day Will I know who won on Election Day? Maybe, but don’t be surprised if we have to wait a few weeks. The Board of Elections can receive absentee ballots until seven days after Election Day, so the results of some races may not be known until all ballots have been received.

Refer to the Contribute Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions for more details. Is my contribution tax deductible? No, contributions to political campaigns are not tax deductible, whether they are made online or in person. Do I need to set up an account to use Contribute? You are not required to create a Contribute account to contribute to campaigns. You can create an account if you would like to save your personal and credit card information to simplify the process of contributing to a campaign in the future. If you would like to create an account, go to contribute.nycvotes.org/signup , and select the “For Contributors” tab. Will my contribution be matched with public funds? If you are a New York City resident and you do not have business dealings with the city , your contribution may be eligible to be matched at an $8-to-$1 rate. That means that a $10 contribution from a NYC resident to a participating candidate could be worth as much as $90 to their campaign. It is the campaign’s responsibility to report your contribution correctly and claim it for matching funds. What happens to my money when I contribute to a campaign? Candidates running for local New York City office have the option of using Contribute as their online fundraising platform. When you donate on Contribute, your contribution is sent directly to the campaign’s bank account via the site’s third-party credit card processor, Stripe. Stripe charges the campaign a nominal and standard fee (2.9% + $0.30) for each contribution. What do you do with my personal information when I contribute to a campaign? In accordance with the Campaign Finance Board Rules, campaigns are required to report each contributor’s full name, residential address, occupation, employer, and business address. The following information will be publicly disclosed in the Campaign Finance Board’s Follow the Money Database : The contributor’s full name. The city, state and zip code of the contributor’s residential address. The contributor’s occupation and employer.

Request a refund directly from the campaign using the campaign’s contact information listed on the Campaign Finance Board website . If you are unable to contact the campaign, email contribute@nyccfb.info . Can I set up a recurring contribution? No. To reduce the risk of campaigns accepting over-the-limit contributions, Contribute does not allow for recurring contributions. Contribute — For Campaigns Back to Top Is Contribute free to use? The CFB does not charge campaigns to use Contribute. Stripe , the credit card processor Contribute uses to direct funds to your bank account, charges a nominal and standard fee (2.9% + $0.30) for each contribution. Stripe will deduct the fee from each contribution prior to funds being deposited into your committee’s bank account. I used Contribute for a previous election cycle. Do I need to create a new account for the current election cycle? If you had a Contribute account in a previous election cycle, you can simply log in using your existing email and password, then you will be prompted to connect to a Stripe account. If you ran in a previous election, you cannot reuse an old Stripe account. After logging into your Contribute account, you must create a new Stripe account by using an email address that is easily accessible by the candidate, treasurer, and anyone else monitoring your Contribute account, as time-sensitive emails may be sent by Stripe to this email address. How do I sign up for Contribute? 1.    Sign up at contribute.nycvotes.org/signup After registering with the CFB, your campaign will have access to Contribute. To create your account, go to contribute.nycvotes.org/signup. 2.    Create your password Click the For Candidates tab and enter the email address listed on your CFB registration and a unique password. Only candidates and treasurers are eligible to have a Contribute account. Best practice: Both the candidate and treasurer should create their own Contribute accounts to receive important communications from Contribute@nyccfb.info. 3.    Agree to the affirmation statement Review the affirmation statement and click I Agree . 4.    Activate your account and connect with Stripe You will receive an email, which will prompt you to activate your Contribute account. You must then connect your Contribute account with Stripe, the credit card processor Contribute uses to direct funds to your bank account. Candidates who have run in the past must create a new Stripe account for each election. After logging into your Contribute account, click the Connect with Stripe button. After clicking Connect with Stripe, you will be directed to a registration form to create a Stripe account. Your Stripe account is separate from your Contribute account and will be used to process contributions made to your campaign on Contribute to your campaign’s bank account. Some of the information you will need to enter in the registration form includes: Business Details: Enter your committee’s information in this section. You will need to complete fields such as: Type of business: Select “Nonprofit Organization” Legal business name: Enter the committee’s name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select “Political Organization” How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select “Within One Day” Executive Details: The campaign’s Stripe account should be created by the candidate (strongly recommended), treasurer, or another campaign representative with significant managerial control. The individual who creates the account will be the Stripe account holder and will need to provide personal identifying information. (For example, home address and the last four digits of Social Security Number.) Credit Card Statement Details: In this section, you will be able to customize how contributions made to your campaign will appear on your contributors’ bank statements. Statement descriptor: This is the “business name” that will appear on your contributors’ bank statement. You should use the committee’s name to avoid disputes over unrecognized transactions. Support phone number: Enter a phone number that can be used to contact you and your campaign. Customer support address: Use the committee’s address. Bank Details: Enter your committee’s bank account number and routing number to set up transfers for contributions received. You must use the same bank account on file with the CFB. Two-Step Authentication: Choose one of Stripe’s security methods to protect your account. Save your Stripe account: Create your login credentials for your Stripe dashboard. Use these credentials to log in directly at www.stripe.com. You can choose to use the same email address linked to your Contribute account, but it is not necessary. Click the Authorize access to this account button to complete the registration form for Stripe. 5. Receive Contribute link After creating your Stripe account, you will receive an email that confirms that your Contribute account has been connected to Stripe, and that contains your unique Contribute link. This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART? After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds. IMPORTANT: Do not manually enter C-SMART contributions received via Contribute. If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.    Sign in to your campaign’s Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.    Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. Contributions received via Fundraising Events will be included in the total number of contributions that appear under this alert. To upload data from Contribute, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Contribute will alert you if you have any contributions that have not been uploaded to C-SMART. You will be able to use the upload function only if there are contributions that have not yet been uploaded to C-SMART. What should I do after uploading contributions to C-SMART? 1.    Review each contribution in C-SMART Review the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to ensure that each contribution was uploaded. For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload.

In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time? Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account.

If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements? Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. How can we help you?

It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases.

You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART?  In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?  A fundraiser is an event that is organized and sponsored by your campaign. For each fundraiser held by your campaign, you must disclose the following information to the CFB: Date of the event Location of the event List of all contributions received at the event Any persons or organization(s) other than the campaign hosting the event Itemized list of all expenditures related to the event, whether the campaign or another host paid for them You can create distinct contribution pages on Contribute for fundraisers organized by your campaign. This will allow you to accept contributions for those fundraisers and simplify the reporting of the event’s name, location, date, and contributions received. 1.    View events and create a new event From the Fundraising Events tab you can create, view, and manage upcoming and past events. 2.    Enter event details Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*); Venue Name and Start and End Time are optional fields. 3.    Share event page with supporters After successfully creating an event, you will be directed to the Share tab found in the event’s administrative page. From here, you will find links to the event page, social media tools to share through different platforms, and HTML codes that can be used to embed the event page on your campaign’s website, emails, and social media pages. The Status of the event will now be Open , meaning contributions can now be collected for this event. IMPORTANT: After an event has occurred, it should be closed to stop new contributions from being made. From the Edit tab in the event’s administrative page, select Close Event . All contributions received via the Fundraising Event feature must be reported to the CFB within the disclosure period in which the event occurred. How do I edit and review fundraising event pages?  1.    Edit event If you would like to make changes to an event, from the event’s administrative page select the Edit tab. From the Edit tab you can update event details and close, open, or delete the event. Deleting an event is only possible if no contributions have been made for that event. This action cannot be undone. You will receive an email for any modifications made to your event. If event details are modified after the event has been uploaded to C-SMART, use the details in this email to make the necessary changes to the event in C-SMART. If you accidentally close an event before it has occurred, the event can be re-opened. Contact your Candidate Services liaison if you need to re-open an event. To customize the contribution amounts for your event page, click on the Tools tab on the event’s administrative page and update the amounts under Custom Amount Tool. Make sure to click Save New Defaults when you’re finished. If you would like to show fewer than five contribution amounts, enter $0 in any of the contribution amount fields. Amounts of $0 will not appear on your fundraising event page. 2.    Manage and view events Return to the Fundraising Events tab to view your events. Events can be sorted by Event Date and Time , Event Name , Status , and Total Contributions by clicking on each header. Click Preview to view the event page that will be shared with contributors. To return to the event’s administrative page, click the hyperlinked event name or click the gear icon and select Edit . 3.    Review fundraising events and contributions From the Contributions tab on the event’s administrative page, individual contributions can be sorted by Date and Time received, Name of contributor, and Amount contributed. From this page, you can also export the list of contributions received through this event page as a CSV file. Like any other contribution received through Contribute, contributions made to events must be reported within the same disclosure period in which they are received and uploaded directly to C-SMART. Contributions made to events must also be claimed for match like any other eligible contribution. Note: As with other contributions received in Contribute, Stripe processing fees are deducted from contributions received through fundraising event pages. Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time?  From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors?  For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer. When refunding a prohibited contribution via Stripe, remember that to be considered resolved, the refund cannot be pending and must have cleared your campaign bank account . From your Stripe Dashboard: Find the contribution to be refunded in the Payments overview page. Click the ••• icon to the right of the charge and select Refund charge. Enter the amount to be refunded. The default is a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a different amount to be refunded. Select a reason for the refund. If you select Other, you must provide an explanatory note that is attached to the refund. Note: the reason entered is for your campaign and Stripe’s records only and is not shared with the CFB. Click Refund . To document the refund in C-SMART, once it has cleared your bank account: While in Stripe, under “Payments - Refunded”, search for your contributor by first name, last name. Identify the specific contribution that was refunded. Click directly on that contribution to open the refund details. Save the entire refund details screen as a PDF by clicking “CTRL+P” and then instead of printing, select “Save as PDF. In C-SMART, add the monetary contribution refund. You can enter “Stripe” as the Check Number. Upload the entire PDF of your Stripe refund details as your refund documentation in C-SMART. For instructions, see Monetary Contribution Refund Documentation in C-SMART Help. How do I embed Contribute on my campaign’s website and customize contribution amounts?  In the Tools tab of your account page, you will be able to set the contribution amounts that appear on your contribution page. You will also find the HTML code to embed your contribution page on your website, in your campaign emails, and on your social media pages. To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each event’s administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time?  Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States?  Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?  Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. Still have questions? Contact us on social media!

Due to term limits and vacancies, 10 of them are wide open. And multiple sitting members who aren’t term-limited are facing serious challenges. In deep blue New York City, there aren’t many swing districts, so most – but not all – of the action will happen in the Democratic primaries, which take place on June 24. We’ve relied on maps from the CUNY Graduate Center’s indispensable Redistricting & You , which uses census and New York City Board of Elections data, for our district demographic and voter information. We haven’t included every City Council candidate in this round-up, just the ones we’ve determined to be viable due to a combination of fundraising, visible campaign presence and notable political support. We’ll update this feature continually throughout this election cycle. In a year when much of the political attention is focused on the mayor and the White House, here are City Council races to watch. This post was last updated March 25. District 1: Lower Manhattan, including the Financial District, Chinatown, City Hall and SoHo TLDR: Incumbent faces YIMBY and NYPD challengers. Incumbent: Chris Marte (Democrat) Challengers: Jess Coleman (Democrat), Elizabeth Lewinsohn (Democrat), Eric Yu (Democrat) District demographics: 45% white, 32% Asian, 13% Hispanic, 5% Black, 1% other/multiple races Voter enrollment: 66% Democratic, 23% unaffiliated, 9% Republican What’s the deal? City Council Member Chris Marte is no stranger to opposition – and spirited opponents – in his lower Manhattan district. He won a crowded primary in 2021 and handily fended off a relatively well-funded and a union-backed challenge in 2023. Marte has been a frequent target of pro-housing advocates for opposing new developments in his district, as well as opposing the City of Yes citywide zoning plan for housing passed last year. (The Elizabeth Street Garden, a small but potent example of one such project Marte opposes, is in this district.) Attorney Jess Coleman is hitting Marte squarely on these kinds of issues – mounting a pro-housing, pro-congestion pricing, pro-outdoor dining campaign. But it’s not just Marte versus Coleman. There’s Elizabeth Lewinsohn , the former policy head at the NYPD’s Counterterrorism Bureau, who has far outraised Coleman and Marte. A member of Community Board 1 alongside Marte, Lewinsohn is less focused on YIMBY-ism than public safety, predicting the latter will be of more importance to residents of the district. Eric Yu , another Community Board 1 member running, shares Marte’s opposition to congestion pricing and wariness of new housing developments. A director at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Yu is far behind in fundraising. The district is reliably blue, but Helen Qiu, who ran as a Republican in 2023, has opened a committee to run again this year. – Annie McDonough Further reading: NYC Council Member Chris Marte likely to face 2025 YIMBY challenge New York City Council challengers are (literally) giving incumbents a run for their money District 2: Lower Manhattan, including Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, the East Village, Gramercy, and Murray Hill-Kips Bay TLDR: This race is more than just Anthony Weiner versus Harvey Epstein. Incumbent: Open seat. Carlina Rivera is term-limited. Candidates: Harvey Epstein (Democrat), Andrea Gordillo (Democrat), Sarah Batchu (Democrat), Anthony Weiner (Democrat), Allison Ryan (Democrat) District demographics: 56% white, 18% Hispanic, 14% Asian, 6% Black, 5% other Voter enrollment: 72% Democrat, 7% Republican, 10% unaffiliated What’s the deal? The race to succeed term-limited City Council Member Carlina Rivera began picking up relatively early last year and has since only grown more competitive going into 2025. Two community board reps have had their hats in the ring since early last year, steadily working to build ground support and bolster their profiles. Sarah Batchu , a former de Blasio administration staffer and nonprofit leader who previously served as vice chair of Community Board 3, has been the race’s top fundraiser, raking in over $82,000 in private donations and $192,500 in public matching funds, according to the latest campaign finance filings. Andrea Gordillo, chair of Community Board 3 and a longtime arts nonprofit worker, is not far behind. Gordillo has received nearly $192,000 in public funds, and nearly $75,000 in private donations. Gordillo also snagged a first-choice endorsement from New Majority NYC, a group that promotes women in the City Council. The group endorsed Batchu as their second choice. Stuy Town and East Village Assembly Member Harvey Epstein announced his plans to run in May and has been endorsed by a long list of elected officials from Reps. Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman to Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Further bolstering his name recognition, Epstein was the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” sketch in November that, well, spoofed his name. Epstein is very well-positioned, with more than $76,500 in private donations and $192,500 in public matching funds. Anthony Weiner , the scandal-scarred former congressman, has been toying with another political comeback attempt and officially jumped into the race in the fall. He’s raised a little over $33,000. With name recognition like his, he could stand a chance – even with his controversial history. Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2017 for sexting a minor. Prior City Council candidate Allison Ryan is also running for the seat again and has raised about $9,500. New Majority NYC endorsed her as their third choice in the race. - Sahalie Donaldson Further reading: City Council candidate proposes WEINER Act to bar sex offenders from elected office New Majority NYC drops slate of City Council 2025 endorsements Anthony Weiner mulls a City Council run in lower Manhattan The 2025 race for Carlina Rivera’s City Council seat is on Epstein to declare run for council District 4: Manhattan neighborhoods of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Murray Hill-Kips Bay, Midtown East, Upper East Side TLDR: A marquee race with massive fundraising befitting the Upper East Side. Incumbent: Open seat. Keith Powers is term-limited. Candidates: Virginia Maloney (Democrat), Rachel Storch (Democrat), Vanessa Aronson (Democrat), Faith Bondy (Democrat), Ben Wetzler (Democrat), Lukas Florczak (Democrat) District demographics: 69% white, 16% Asian, 8% Hispanic, 3% Black, 1% other Voter enrollment: 60% Democratic, 22% unaffiliated, 15% Republican What’s the deal? In the race to replace City Council Member Keith Powers, nearly every candidate running is mounting a serious campaign, built on local civic experience, resources, name recognition or a little bit of each. Unfortunately for the candidates, that makes their competition steep. City Council District 4 stretches up from Stuy Town to the toniest parts of the Upper East Side, and candidates have the fundraising to prove it, with well over a collective half million dollars in private donations raised between them. Responsible for  more than half of that fundraising alone is Rachel Storch , a former Missouri state legislator who moved to the district in 2010 and is now COO at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue. She has raised over $369,000 as of March 17 and is opting out of the city’s public matching system. Also running is Virginia Maloney , daughter of longtime Rep. (and name recognition-booster) Carolyn Maloney. Virginia, who previously worked at Meta and the city’s economic development arm, has an impressive haul herself, outraising several other candidates with more local civic ties. That includes former district leader Ben Wetzler , a policy official at the state agency for affordable housing; Lexington Democratic Club President and former public school teacher Vanessa Aronson ; and Samuel J. Tilden Democratic Club President and attorney Faith Bondy . All four of those candidates have qualified for and received public matching funds. Lucas Florczak , a veterans’ advocate and member of the Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats, is also running but hasn’t raised nearly as much as the other five candidates or qualified for matching funds. How much the six candidates will seek to establish daylight between each other on policy over the course of the campaign remains to be seen. Several name funding the NYPD and affordable housing as top priorities. Powers – a mainstream liberal, like much of the field running to replace him – could also be influential if he chose to endorse in the race, but it doesn’t seem likely that he will. He’s got his own race for Manhattan borough president to focus on. – Annie McDonough Further reading: With a well-funded former Missouri lawmaker in the mix, Upper East Side council race is shaping up to be pricey Carolyn Maloney’s daughter Virginia files to run for City Council District 8: South Bronx and areas of northern Manhattan including East Harlem, Randall’s Island TLDR: Will staffer-to-principal continuity be preserved in East Harlem? Incumbent: Open seat. Diana Ayala is term-limited. Candidates: Elsie Encarnacion (Democrat), Raymond Santana (Democrat), Wilfredo Lopez (Democrat), Clarisa Alayeto (Democrat), Daniel Aulbach-Sidibe (Democrat) Nicholas Reyes (Democrat), Rosa Diaz (Democrat) District demographics: 55% Hispanic, 25% Black, 12% white, 6% Asian, 3% other Voter enrollment: 77% Democrat, 4% Republican, 19% unaffiliated What’s the deal? If it was up to term-limited City Council Member Diana Ayala, who has represented the district since 2018, her successor would be Elsie Encarnacion – her current chief of staff. She’s Latina, born and raised in East Harlem, a former community board member, and a parent coordinator at a local school. With nearly $184,000 raised, including public matching funds, and the backing of the popular deputy City Council speaker, Encarnacion is in a strong position going into the election year. Even some of her potential future colleagues in the City Council have donated to her campaign, including Council Members Rafael Salamanca and Crystal Hudson. Quite a few other candidates are also vying to represent the district and two have qualified for public matching funds. While Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs filed to run for the seat, he’s since decided not to – good news for the other candidates, none of whom have previously held elected office. Wilfredo López , a nonprofit lawyer and the former legislative director and counsel for then-City Council Member Ben Kallos, has raised a little over $33,000 in private donations and $68,000 in public matching funds for his bid so far, though he’ll very likely end up maxing out on donations. A political action committee called Ending Homelessness and Building a Better NYC, backed by financial firm founder Michael Jenkins, plans to support López’s campaign. A different Jenkins-funded PAC also supported his ultimately unsuccessful state Assembly run in 2022, which Gibbs won. After Yusef Salaam’s stunning victory in 2023, Raymond Santana is looking to be the second member of the “Exonerated Five” elected to the New York City Council, entering the race in late February – just as the petitioning process to get on the ballot began. After primarily living in Georgia since 2015, he’s looking to reintroduce himself to his native East Harlem community and the rest of the city more than three decades after he was wrongly blamed in the infamous Central Park Five case as a teenager. He moved to East Harlem full time last year. While Santana has a powerful story to tell, he’ll need to quickly raise money to catch up with the other candidates. Yet to qualify for public matching funds, he’s off to a fairly strong start with roughly $19,500 raised. Bronx Community Board 1 Chair Clarisa Alayeto , who was born in East Harlem and grew up in the NYCHA Patterson Houses in Mott Haven, launched her campaign in December. She’s raised roughly $32,000 in private donations and qualified for nearly $61,000 in public matching funds. Daniel Aulbach-Sidibe , a longtime educator and former UFT chapter leader who lives in the South Bronx, has raised nearly $21,000 in private donations. Also in the running, but with little to no money raised at this point, is community activist Nicholas Reyes and Community Board 11 Secretary Rosa Diaz . – Sahalie Donaldson Further reading: Diana Ayala has a possible successor in mind: her chief of staff Another ‘Exonerated 5’ member eyeing a Manhattan City Council seat District 13: Northeast section of the Bronx, including Morris Park, Pelham Parkway, Pelham Bay, Van Nest, Westchester Square, Throggs Neck and City Island TLDR: A Republican stunned the city by flipping this district in 2023. Democrats are scrambling. Incumbent: Kristy Marmorato (Republican) Democratic primary candidates: Shirley Aldebol (Democrat), David Diaz (Democrat), John Perez (Democrat), Theona Reets-DuPont (Democrat), Jacqueline Torres (Democrat) District demographics: 45% Hispanic, 31% white, 12% Black, 8% Asian, 4% other Voter enrollment: 62% Democrat, 20% unaffiliated, 14% Republican, 4% other What’s the deal? It’s been a little over a year since Republican City Council Member Kristy Marmorato defeated former Democratic City Council Member Marjorie Velázquez in the northeast Bronx, ending a decades-long period in which no Republicans had been elected in the borough. Now Democrats hope to get the seat back. While one of the biggest questions looming over the upcoming Democratic primary has been whether Velázquez, who recently joined the Adams administration as director for tenant protection, will run for her old seat again, sources close to the matter said this isn’t happening. That leaves Shirley Aldebol , a Bronx native with deep union ties, in a strong position to win the primary. She won the support of the Bronx County Democratic Party and raised the most so far, pulling in nearly $38,000. For years, Aldebol has worked with 32BJ SEIU, most recently overseeing the public schools division, which includes over 5,000 members who work as cleaners and handypersons, but she retired in early February to focus full time on her campaign. The powerful union will no doubt be in her corner though and has already been pushing her hard as a candidate. Jacqueline Torres , a veteran and HR professional who lives in Throggs Neck, has raised the next most, pulling in roughly $32,000 despite her lack of institutional support and fairly late entry into the race. David Diaz , a senior executive director at a boutique investment firm with a long history of volunteerism in the district, has raised roughly $9,000. Also in the running is Theona Reets-DuPont , chief of staff and budget director for City Council Member Oswald Feliz, and John Perez , a veteran who has mounted several unsuccessful campaigns in the past. Marmorato herself will no doubt easily win the Republican primary. No other candidates have filed to challenge her yet. For whoever ultimately wins the Democratic primary, winning the November general election will be no small feat. The district grew redder during the most recent presidential election. Observers say name recognition across the district will be everything – something neither Aldebol, Torres and Diaz have a great deal of yet. – Sahalie Donaldson District 14: Bronx neighborhoods of University Heights, Fordham Heights, Kingsbridge Heights, Morris Heights TLDR: Eric Adams-aligned pastor looks for a political comeback against a progressive incumbent. Incumbent: Pierina Sanchez (Democrat) Democratic primary candidates: Fernando Cabrera (Democrat), Bryan Hodge Vasquez (Democrat) District demographics: 72% Hispanic, 20% Black, 3% white, 3% Asian, 1% other Voter enrollment: 76% Democratic, 17% unaffiliated, 5% Republican What’s the deal? Could 2025 be the year of the comeback campaign? The mayor’s race and several City Council races offer a bounty of opportunities, including in the Bronx’s District 14, where former Council Member Fernando Cabrera will be incumbent Council Member Pierina Sanchez ’s strongest competition in her bid for reelection. Sanchez, who was elected in 2021 when Cabrera was term-limited out, is a member of the council’s Progressive Caucus who has made affordable housing a key issue as chair of the Committee on Housing and Buildings. She was elected with support from Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and was considered a part of his alliance of northern Manhattan and Bronx officials dubbed the “Squadriano.” Though Sanchez isn’t known for being far-left, Cabrera is a conservative Democrat who could get pickup in a district that became less deep blue in the last presidential election. Cabrera has his own baggage, though. A longtime Christian pastor, he had to apologize for anti-gay comments he’s made over the years when he was hired as a faith adviser at the outset of Mayor Eric Adams’ administration – a role he left in 2023. Also running (and steadily fundraising) in the Democratic primary is Bryan Hodge Vazquez , a 24-year-old Bronx native who is campaigning to change the status quo of the district getting the short end of the stick – from higher violent crime rates to collapsing buildings. He was previously an intern and fellow for Espaillat and Council Member Shaun Abreu, respectively. All three of those candidates have qualified for and received public matching funds, though Sanchez has the lead in donations. Though Sanchez will likely benefit from incumbent advantages including institutional endorsements, Cabrera shouldn’t be underestimated. In the 2021 Democratic primary for Bronx borough president in which he came in a close second, performing particularly well in University Heights and Kingsbridge Heights. Council Member Darlene Mealy – also a formerly term-limited council member who later ousted her successor for a second tour in the council – is among Cabrera’s donors, as is Assembly Member Al Taylor. John Maynard Harris and Evette Wilson have also opened committees to run in the district. – Annie McDonough Further reading: How Rep. Adriano Espaillat built the Squadriano District 17: Bronx neighborhoods of Melrose, Hunts Point, Longwood, Morrisania, Crotona Park East TLDR: Incumbent Rafael Salamanca is backing an old-school business man to replace him, and an upstart state Senate staffer is giving him a run for his money. Incumbent: Open seat. Salamanca is term-limited, and he’s running for borough president. Candidates: Freddy Perez (Democrat), Justin Sanchez (Democrat), Elvis Santana (Democrat), Antirson Ortiz (Democrat), Jasmine Uribe (Democrat) District demographics: 65% Hispanic, 29% Black, 2% white, 1% Asian Voter enrollment: 77% Democrat, 4% Republican, 16% unaffiliated What’s the deal? Outgoing City Council Member Rafael Salamanca is the council’s powerful Land Use Committee chair, and his tenure has been marked by significant development of affordable housing in the district. Salamanca, who is Puerto Rican, is challenging incumbent Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, the first Black woman to hold the seat. He is backing business owner Freddy Perez in the race to replace him in the council. Perez, who is a district leader and runs a party supply business, is partly distinguished in the race by his age. At 59, he’s the lone Gen X competing against a few younger folks, including state Sen. Nathalia Fernandez’s chief of staff Justin Sanchez . Sanchez was formerly president of the Stonewall Democratic Club, one of the city’s LGBTQ+ political clubs, and he currently leads the pack in fundraising and spending. Plus, he’s clinched the support of the Bronx County Democratic machine. The popular former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. has donated to both Perez and Sanchez. Elvis Santana came up through the Estella B. Diggs Democratic Club and has backing from mayoral candidate and former Assembly Member Michael Blake. Director of Constituent Services at the city comptroller’s office Antirson Ortiz is currently a state committee member and is close with mayoral candidate Scott Stringer. Perez, Sanchez, Santana and Ortiz have all received public matching funds. Entrepreneur Jasmine Uribe is also running, but so far doesn’t seem to have gained much traction. – Holly Pretsky District 21: Queens neighborhoods of East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and Corona TLDR: Everyone in Queens already has a candidate in this race – except the incumbent. Incumbent: Open seat. Francisco Moya is term-limited. Candidates: Sandro Stefano Navarro (Democrat), Erycka Montoya (Democrat), Hiram Monserrate (Democrat), Shanel Thomas-Henry (Democrat), Yanna Henriquez (Democrat) District demographics: 75% Hispanic, 12% Asian, 8% Black, 4% white, 1% other Voter enrollment: 70% Democrat, 23% unaffiliated, 7% Republican What’s the deal? Just about every local political leader in this diverse, heavily immigrant district has their opinion on who they’d like the next City Council member to be – with the exception of term-limited City Council Member Francisco Moya, who has yet to endorse a candidate. That means a competitive Democratic primary. Progressive Assembly Members Catalina Cruz and Jessica González-Rojas are backing Erycka Montoya , who works in intergovernmental affairs with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams’ office. Mayoral candidate state Sen. Jessica Ramos is backing her district director Sandro Stefano Navarro , an Army National Guard veteran. Embattled former lawmaker Hiram Monserrate , a previous representative of the district, and nonprofit worker and district leader Yanna Henriquez are also running, though neither have been endorsed by any local elected officials. LaGuardia Redevelopment Program public information liaison Shanel Thomas-Henry , a member of the local community board, has run a strong campaign so far. Despite only recently entering the race, she’s already raised at least $43,000 in private donations – more than any other candidate – and qualified for roughly $133,000 in public matching funds. Recently-retired Queens Assembly Member Jeffrion Aubry is among those who donated to her campaign. Given that the district is heavily Latino, securing the support of Latino local leaders could be particularly important for Thomas-Henry, who is Black. All of the other leading candidates are Latino. She along with Montoya and Navarro scored a recent endorsement from the Working Families Party. Monserrate, who has been heavily involved in an ongoing campaign to fight crime on the Roosevelt Avenue Corridor, has the second largest fundraising haul with roughly $35,600 raised. While he has the greatest name recognition, he’s also got the most baggage – like being booted from the state Senate in 2010 after he assaulted his then-girlfriend and pleading guilty to felony mail fraud charges. Even though most of Monserrate’s previous comeback attempts have failed, he’s been a district leader since 2018, proving he clearly still has political capital. Montoya has raised just shy of $27,000, Navarro a little over $19,00, and Henriquez roughly $18,000. – Sahalie Donaldson Further reading: In the race to replace Francisco Moya, everyone has a candidate District 28 Queens neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Jamaica, South Jamaica, Baisley Park, Springfield Gardens TLDR: Adrienne Adams’ chief of staff hopes the association is more gift than curse Incumbent: Open seat. New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is term-limited. Candidates: Tyrell Hankerson (Democrat), Romeo Hitlall (Democrat), Latoya LeGrand (Democrat), Japneet Singh (Democrat) District demographics: 45% Black, 16% Asian, 16% Hispanic, 9% other, 3% white Voter enrollment: 75% Democrat, 17% unaffiliated, 5% Republican What’s the deal? The chief of staff to council member pipeline is tried and true . Tyrell “Ty” Hankerson , chief of staff and longtime staffer to Speaker Adrienne Adams, is certainly hoping the pattern follows for him this June, where he and three others are running in the Democratic primary for the seat Adams will vacate due to term limits. Hankerson, born in South Ozone Park, has clear ties to the Southeast Queens district, but working for Adams has provided a direct line and experience working with constituents – a fact his campaign will emphasize. But he’s not the only one with those ties. Latoya LeGrand , a nonprofit founder, education committee chair on Community Board 12, and the constituent services representative for Assembly Member Vivian Cook, is also running. Cook has yet to endorse in the race, and Hankerson has garnered some of the major local endorsements so far including Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and the Queens County Democratic Party. Between the two, Hankerson also has he lead in private donations. But Hankerson and LeGrand have company. Romeo Hitlall , a community board member and respected Lion’s Club leader, and Japneet Singh , a former challenger to Adams who has raised a strong $30,000 in private donations, make the race all the more competitive. Singh, Hitlall, Hankerson and LeGrand have all received public matching funds, though Singh has received the most. Some observers expect the vote to split along ethnic lines; Hankerson and LeGrand are both Black and have ties to the southeastern part of the district, while Hitlall and Singh are expected to mobilize Indo-Caribbean and Sikh communities, respectively, in South Ozone Park and Richmond Hill. All campaigns, however, say they expect to have support in every part of the district. While Hankerson’s work and close alignment with Adams is expected to work in his favor in many ways – her endorsement was a given – some of his challengers will argue that the district needs change, and could stir up dissatisfaction with hot-button votes under Adams, including the City of Yes housing plan and How Many Stops Act. – Annie McDonough Further reading: Adrienne Adams’ staffer wants to succeed her. One of his opponents is attracting GOP support. District 30: Queens neighborhoods of Maspeth, Middle Village and parts of Glendale, Ridgewood, Elmhurst and Rego Park TLDR: Can any of the incumbent’s multipartisan staffers beat a union powerbroker in this very purple district? Incumbent: Open seat. Bob Holden is term-limited. Candidates: Dermot Smyth (Democrat), Phil Wong (Democrat), Paul Pogozelski (Democrat), Alicia Vaichunas (Republican), Jonathan Rinaldi (Republican) District demographics: 45% white, 30% Hispanic, 20% Asian, 2% Black Voter enrollment: 51% Democrat, 18% Republican, 27% unaffiliated What’s the deal? Term-limited Council Member Bob Holden is one of a kind. He’s a registered Democrat, but he’s co-chair of the council’s conservative Common Sense Caucus and has run on the Republican line (and several other party lines) in his elections to the City Council. He’s backing two staffers in two different primaries – Republican Alicia Vaichunas and Democrat Phil Wong – to replace him. Holden’s move underscores a rare truth in this city: The November general election in District 30 will be competitive. In the Democratic primary, United Federation of Teachers operative Dermot Smyth , who has spent years maneuvering the powerful union’s political endorsement process, has virtually unmatched backing from elected officials across the city. Smyth also has a significant fundraising lead, with more than $62,000 in private funds raised as of mid-January. Wong, a vocal education activist who has fought to preserve the city’s gifted and talented programs as well as the specialized high school admission test, joined Holden’s office in 2023 as constituent services and budget director. He hasn’t disclosed fundraising yet. Middle Village roller hockey league leader Paul Pogozelski , who has raised a respectable $11,000 in private donations, is also in the race. Vaichunas has worked with Holden since she ran his first race for council, and she is now his deputy chief of staff. She’s running with county GOP support and has received a donation from neighboring Republican Queens City Council Member Joann Ariola. Along with Smyth and Pogozelski, Vaichunas has received public matching funds. In the Republican primary, she faces MAGA perennial candidate Jonathan Rinaldi , who has not fundraised in any meaningful way. Rinaldi is known for his activism against vaccinations, confronting elected officials and more recently allegedly impersonating a City & State reporter. – Holly Pretsky Further reading: Every politician you know donated to a bloke by the name of Dermot Smyth Republican council candidate harasses Queens elected officials District 38: Brooklyn neighborhoods of Red Hook, South Slope, Sunset Park, Borough Park, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Bath Beach TLDR: A moderate Asian American challenger comes for a socialist Latina incumbent in a district with a large immigrant population. Incumbent: Alexa Avilés (Democrat) Challengers: Ling Ye (Democrat) District demographics: 37% Hispanic, 32% Asian, 25% white, 4% Black Voter enrollment: 63% Democrat, 11% Republican, 23% unaffiliated What’s the deal? This diverse, sprawling district with large Latino and Asian immigrant populations has been redrawn since City Council Member Alexa Avilés first won it in 2021. It now includes areas in southern Brooklyn that voted for Donald Trump in November: Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst. In 2021, Avilés, who was backed by Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party, won her general election with a 60-point margin. In 2023, after redistricting, that margin shrank considerably to 33 points. But before she gets to the general election this year, the DSA- and WFP-endorsed council member, who chairs the Immigration Committee, is facing a serious primary challenge. Ling Ye , a Chinese American moderate Democrat, has worked for Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Nydia Velázquez as well as former District 38 Council Member Carlos Menchaca. Ye is running toward the center, saying Avilés’ left-wing ideology has gotten in the way of her ability to advocate for her constituents. She cited Avilés’ decisions to vote against the New York City budget three years in a row as an example. Avilés has also spoken in support of Palestinian liberation, exposing her to the ire of pro-Israel interests and the conservative New York Post. Ye is already backed by the pro-Israel Solidarity PAC. It’ll be a tough race, but Avilés’ office is known for being active in the district, and her incumbency advantage remains strong. On the Republican side, banking program manager and community yoga teacher Luis Quero is running on a public safety platform, and so far isn’t facing a primary challenge. Quero also wants to roll back bail reforms, block luxury condos from the district and tackle deed theft. – Holly Pretsky District 39: Brooklyn neighborhoods of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and the Columbia Waterfront TLDR: Pro-Israel constituents want to oust a socialist incumbent in one of the city’s most progressive districts. Incumbent: Shahana Hanif (Democrat) Challenger: Maya Kornberg (Democrat) District demographics: 60% white, 15% Hispanic, 13% Asian, 6% Black Voter enrollment: 76% Democrat, 6% Republican, 15% unaffiliated What’s the deal? Both Council Member Shahana Hanif and challenger Maya Kornberg say that their primary election shouldn’t be about Israel or the war in Gaza. The New York City Council has no real power to influence the conflict. But in the Democratic primary in one of the city’s bluest City Council districts, that subject continues to come to the forefront. It’s also drawn some support to Kornberg, a Jewish academic whose work has centered on democratic governance and political violence, and whose most recent post is as a senior research fellow at the Brennan Center. Hanif is a Democratic socialist and the first Muslim woman to be elected to the City Council, where she is a co-chair of the Progressive Caucus. She previously worked for her predecessor in the office – mayoral candidate and City Comptroller Brad Lander. Hanif, along with some of her colleagues in the Progressive Caucus, has been vocal in calling for a ceasefire. Some Jewish members of the district and around the city have harshly criticized Hanif for not condemning Hamas’ attacks soon enough or being responsive enough to antisemitic incidents in the district. And some of those voices are mobilizing to ensure Hanif doesn’t get another term. Solidarity PAC, a pro-Israel committee that endorsed several other candidates around the city, is backing Kornberg. Kornberg, a self-described “pragmatic progressive” who in January notably called for outside groups to stay out of the race, has targeted her criticism on Hanif’s constituent services and her past calls to defund the NYPD. Kornberg has notched support from two Democratic clubs in the district: Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats and Independent Neighborhood Democrats. Hanif carries distinct incumbent advantages, including that many parts of the district are deeply liberal, and endorsements from the Working Families Party and local elected officials including Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. Both Hanif and Kornberg have raised substantial private donations and received public matching funds. Another candidate, Luke Saghir, also opened a committee to run in the district but has not been fundraising. – Annie McDonough Further reading: Amid reelection battle, Shahana Hanif lands a heated rezoning deal Shahana Hanif talks reelection campaign, and why she’s not seeking DSA endorsement Maya Kornberg pitches ‘pragmatic progressivism’ in Brooklyn council race These NYC Council challengers are fundraising aggressively Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of the write up for the District 8 race inaccurately stated that Wilfredo López was backed by the same PAC in 2022 that’s currently supporting his campaign. The PACs were indeed different, though financial firm founder Michael Jenkins was involved in both. In District 30, the name of Paul Pogozelski’s hockey league has been corrected. In District 28, we’ve removed a misleading characterization of endorsements. In DIstrict 13, an editing error mischaracterizing the timeline of Kristy Marmorato's election has been corrected. Share This: NEXT STORY: State Sen.

Due to term limits and vacancies, 10 of them are wide open. And multiple sitting members who aren’t term-limited are facing serious challenges. In deep blue New York City, there aren’t many swing districts, so most – but not all – of the action will happen in the Democratic primaries, which take place on June 24. We’ve relied on maps from the CUNY Graduate Center’s indispensable Redistricting & You , which uses census and New York City Board of Elections data, for our district demographic and voter information. We haven’t included every City Council candidate in this round-up, just the ones we’ve determined to be viable due to a combination of fundraising, visible campaign presence and notable political support. We’ll update this feature continually throughout this election cycle. In a year when much of the political attention is focused on the mayor and the White House, here are City Council races to watch. This post was last updated March 25. District 1: Lower Manhattan, including the Financial District, Chinatown, City Hall and SoHo TLDR: Incumbent faces YIMBY and NYPD challengers. Incumbent: Chris Marte (Democrat) Challengers: Jess Coleman (Democrat), Elizabeth Lewinsohn (Democrat), Eric Yu (Democrat) District demographics: 45% white, 32% Asian, 13% Hispanic, 5% Black, 1% other/multiple races Voter enrollment: 66% Democratic, 23% unaffiliated, 9% Republican What’s the deal? City Council Member Chris Marte is no stranger to opposition – and spirited opponents – in his lower Manhattan district. He won a crowded primary in 2021 and handily fended off a relatively well-funded and a union-backed challenge in 2023. Marte has been a frequent target of pro-housing advocates for opposing new developments in his district, as well as opposing the City of Yes citywide zoning plan for housing passed last year. (The Elizabeth Street Garden, a small but potent example of one such project Marte opposes, is in this district.) Attorney Jess Coleman is hitting Marte squarely on these kinds of issues – mounting a pro-housing, pro-congestion pricing, pro-outdoor dining campaign. But it’s not just Marte versus Coleman. There’s Elizabeth Lewinsohn , the former policy head at the NYPD’s Counterterrorism Bureau, who has far outraised Coleman and Marte. A member of Community Board 1 alongside Marte, Lewinsohn is less focused on YIMBY-ism than public safety, predicting the latter will be of more importance to residents of the district. Eric Yu , another Community Board 1 member running, shares Marte’s opposition to congestion pricing and wariness of new housing developments. A director at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Yu is far behind in fundraising. The district is reliably blue, but Helen Qiu, who ran as a Republican in 2023, has opened a committee to run again this year. – Annie McDonough Further reading: NYC Council Member Chris Marte likely to face 2025 YIMBY challenge New York City Council challengers are (literally) giving incumbents a run for their money District 1: Lower Manhattan, including the Financial District, Chinatown, City Hall and SoHo Incumbent: Chris Marte (Democrat) Challengers: Jess Coleman (Democrat), Elizabeth Lewinsohn (Democrat), Eric Yu (Democrat) District demographics: 45% white, 32% Asian, 13% Hispanic, 5% Black, 1% other/multiple races Voter enrollment: 66% Democratic, 23% unaffiliated, 9% Republican What’s the deal?

Incumbent: Open seat. Carlina Rivera is term-limited. Candidates: Harvey Epstein (Democrat), Andrea Gordillo (Democrat), Sarah Batchu (Democrat), Anthony Weiner (Democrat), Allison Ryan (Democrat) District demographics: 56% white, 18% Hispanic, 14% Asian, 6% Black, 5% other Voter enrollment: 72% Democrat, 7% Republican, 10% unaffiliated What’s the deal? The race to succeed term-limited City Council Member Carlina Rivera began picking up relatively early last year and has since only grown more competitive going into 2025. Two community board reps have had their hats in the ring since early last year, steadily working to build ground support and bolster their profiles. Sarah Batchu , a former de Blasio administration staffer and nonprofit leader who previously served as vice chair of Community Board 3, has been the race’s top fundraiser, raking in over $82,000 in private donations and $192,500 in public matching funds, according to the latest campaign finance filings. Andrea Gordillo, chair of Community Board 3 and a longtime arts nonprofit worker, is not far behind. Gordillo has received nearly $192,000 in public funds, and nearly $75,000 in private donations. Gordillo also snagged a first-choice endorsement from New Majority NYC, a group that promotes women in the City Council. The group endorsed Batchu as their second choice. Stuy Town and East Village Assembly Member Harvey Epstein announced his plans to run in May and has been endorsed by a long list of elected officials from Reps. Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman to Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Further bolstering his name recognition, Epstein was the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” sketch in November that, well, spoofed his name. Epstein is very well-positioned, with more than $76,500 in private donations and $192,500 in public matching funds. Anthony Weiner , the scandal-scarred former congressman, has been toying with another political comeback attempt and officially jumped into the race in the fall. He’s raised a little over $33,000. With name recognition like his, he could stand a chance – even with his controversial history. Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2017 for sexting a minor. Prior City Council candidate Allison Ryan is also running for the seat again and has raised about $9,500. New Majority NYC endorsed her as their third choice in the race. - Sahalie Donaldson Further reading: City Council candidate proposes WEINER Act to bar sex offenders from elected office New Majority NYC drops slate of City Council 2025 endorsements Anthony Weiner mulls a City Council run in lower Manhattan The 2025 race for Carlina Rivera’s City Council seat is on Epstein to declare run for council District 2: Lower Manhattan, including Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, the East Village, Gramercy, and Murray Hill-Kips Bay Incumbent: Open seat.

Incumbent: Open seat. Keith Powers is term-limited. Candidates: Virginia Maloney (Democrat), Rachel Storch (Democrat), Vanessa Aronson (Democrat), Faith Bondy (Democrat), Ben Wetzler (Democrat), Lukas Florczak (Democrat) District demographics: 69% white, 16% Asian, 8% Hispanic, 3% Black, 1% other Voter enrollment: 60% Democratic, 22% unaffiliated, 15% Republican What’s the deal? In the race to replace City Council Member Keith Powers, nearly every candidate running is mounting a serious campaign, built on local civic experience, resources, name recognition or a little bit of each. Unfortunately for the candidates, that makes their competition steep. City Council District 4 stretches up from Stuy Town to the toniest parts of the Upper East Side, and candidates have the fundraising to prove it, with well over a collective half million dollars in private donations raised between them. Responsible for  more than half of that fundraising alone is Rachel Storch , a former Missouri state legislator who moved to the district in 2010 and is now COO at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue. She has raised over $369,000 as of March 17 and is opting out of the city’s public matching system. Also running is Virginia Maloney , daughter of longtime Rep. (and name recognition-booster) Carolyn Maloney. Virginia, who previously worked at Meta and the city’s economic development arm, has an impressive haul herself, outraising several other candidates with more local civic ties. That includes former district leader Ben Wetzler , a policy official at the state agency for affordable housing; Lexington Democratic Club President and former public school teacher Vanessa Aronson ; and Samuel J. Tilden Democratic Club President and attorney Faith Bondy . All four of those candidates have qualified for and received public matching funds. Lucas Florczak , a veterans’ advocate and member of the Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats, is also running but hasn’t raised nearly as much as the other five candidates or qualified for matching funds. How much the six candidates will seek to establish daylight between each other on policy over the course of the campaign remains to be seen. Several name funding the NYPD and affordable housing as top priorities. Powers – a mainstream liberal, like much of the field running to replace him – could also be influential if he chose to endorse in the race, but it doesn’t seem likely that he will. He’s got his own race for Manhattan borough president to focus on. – Annie McDonough Further reading: With a well-funded former Missouri lawmaker in the mix, Upper East Side council race is shaping up to be pricey Carolyn Maloney’s daughter Virginia files to run for City Council District 4: Manhattan neighborhoods of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Murray Hill-Kips Bay, Midtown East, Upper East Side Incumbent: Open seat.

Incumbent: Open seat. Diana Ayala is term-limited. Candidates: Elsie Encarnacion (Democrat), Raymond Santana (Democrat), Wilfredo Lopez (Democrat), Clarisa Alayeto (Democrat), Daniel Aulbach-Sidibe (Democrat) Nicholas Reyes (Democrat), Rosa Diaz (Democrat) District demographics: 55% Hispanic, 25% Black, 12% white, 6% Asian, 3% other Voter enrollment: 77% Democrat, 4% Republican, 19% unaffiliated What’s the deal? If it was up to term-limited City Council Member Diana Ayala, who has represented the district since 2018, her successor would be Elsie Encarnacion – her current chief of staff. She’s Latina, born and raised in East Harlem, a former community board member, and a parent coordinator at a local school. With nearly $184,000 raised, including public matching funds, and the backing of the popular deputy City Council speaker, Encarnacion is in a strong position going into the election year. Even some of her potential future colleagues in the City Council have donated to her campaign, including Council Members Rafael Salamanca and Crystal Hudson. Quite a few other candidates are also vying to represent the district and two have qualified for public matching funds. While Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs filed to run for the seat, he’s since decided not to – good news for the other candidates, none of whom have previously held elected office. Wilfredo López , a nonprofit lawyer and the former legislative director and counsel for then-City Council Member Ben Kallos, has raised a little over $33,000 in private donations and $68,000 in public matching funds for his bid so far, though he’ll very likely end up maxing out on donations. A political action committee called Ending Homelessness and Building a Better NYC, backed by financial firm founder Michael Jenkins, plans to support López’s campaign. A different Jenkins-funded PAC also supported his ultimately unsuccessful state Assembly run in 2022, which Gibbs won. After Yusef Salaam’s stunning victory in 2023, Raymond Santana is looking to be the second member of the “Exonerated Five” elected to the New York City Council, entering the race in late February – just as the petitioning process to get on the ballot began. After primarily living in Georgia since 2015, he’s looking to reintroduce himself to his native East Harlem community and the rest of the city more than three decades after he was wrongly blamed in the infamous Central Park Five case as a teenager. He moved to East Harlem full time last year. While Santana has a powerful story to tell, he’ll need to quickly raise money to catch up with the other candidates. Yet to qualify for public matching funds, he’s off to a fairly strong start with roughly $19,500 raised. Bronx Community Board 1 Chair Clarisa Alayeto , who was born in East Harlem and grew up in the NYCHA Patterson Houses in Mott Haven, launched her campaign in December. She’s raised roughly $32,000 in private donations and qualified for nearly $61,000 in public matching funds. Daniel Aulbach-Sidibe , a longtime educator and former UFT chapter leader who lives in the South Bronx, has raised nearly $21,000 in private donations.

It’s been a little over a year since Republican City Council Member Kristy Marmorato defeated former Democratic City Council Member Marjorie Velázquez in the northeast Bronx, ending a decades-long period in which no Republicans had been elected in the borough. Now Democrats hope to get the seat back. While one of the biggest questions looming over the upcoming Democratic primary has been whether Velázquez, who recently joined the Adams administration as director for tenant protection, will run for her old seat again, sources close to the matter said this isn’t happening. That leaves Shirley Aldebol , a Bronx native with deep union ties, in a strong position to win the primary. She won the support of the Bronx County Democratic Party and raised the most so far, pulling in nearly $38,000. For years, Aldebol has worked with 32BJ SEIU, most recently overseeing the public schools division, which includes over 5,000 members who work as cleaners and handypersons, but she retired in early February to focus full time on her campaign. The powerful union will no doubt be in her corner though and has already been pushing her hard as a candidate. Jacqueline Torres , a veteran and HR professional who lives in Throggs Neck, has raised the next most, pulling in roughly $32,000 despite her lack of institutional support and fairly late entry into the race. David Diaz , a senior executive director at a boutique investment firm with a long history of volunteerism in the district, has raised roughly $9,000. Also in the running is Theona Reets-DuPont , chief of staff and budget director for City Council Member Oswald Feliz, and John Perez , a veteran who has mounted several unsuccessful campaigns in the past. Marmorato herself will no doubt easily win the Republican primary. No other candidates have filed to challenge her yet. For whoever ultimately wins the Democratic primary, winning the November general election will be no small feat. The district grew redder during the most recent presidential election. Observers say name recognition across the district will be everything – something neither Aldebol, Torres and Diaz have a great deal of yet. – Sahalie Donaldson District 13: Northeast section of the Bronx, including Morris Park, Pelham Parkway, Pelham Bay, Van Nest, Westchester Square, Throggs Neck and City Island Incumbent: Kristy Marmorato (Republican) Democratic primary candidates: Shirley Aldebol (Democrat), David Diaz (Democrat), John Perez (Democrat), Theona Reets-DuPont (Democrat), Jacqueline Torres (Democrat) District demographics: 45% Hispanic, 31% white, 12% Black, 8% Asian, 4% other Voter enrollment: 62% Democrat, 20% unaffiliated, 14% Republican, 4% other What’s the deal?

Incumbent: Pierina Sanchez (Democrat) Democratic primary candidates: Fernando Cabrera (Democrat), Bryan Hodge Vasquez (Democrat) District demographics: 72% Hispanic, 20% Black, 3% white, 3% Asian, 1% other Voter enrollment: 76% Democratic, 17% unaffiliated, 5% Republican What’s the deal? Could 2025 be the year of the comeback campaign? The mayor’s race and several City Council races offer a bounty of opportunities, including in the Bronx’s District 14, where former Council Member Fernando Cabrera will be incumbent Council Member Pierina Sanchez ’s strongest competition in her bid for reelection. Sanchez, who was elected in 2021 when Cabrera was term-limited out, is a member of the council’s Progressive Caucus who has made affordable housing a key issue as chair of the Committee on Housing and Buildings. She was elected with support from Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and was considered a part of his alliance of northern Manhattan and Bronx officials dubbed the “Squadriano.” Though Sanchez isn’t known for being far-left, Cabrera is a conservative Democrat who could get pickup in a district that became less deep blue in the last presidential election. Cabrera has his own baggage, though. A longtime Christian pastor, he had to apologize for anti-gay comments he’s made over the years when he was hired as a faith adviser at the outset of Mayor Eric Adams’ administration – a role he left in 2023. Also running (and steadily fundraising) in the Democratic primary is Bryan Hodge Vazquez , a 24-year-old Bronx native who is campaigning to change the status quo of the district getting the short end of the stick – from higher violent crime rates to collapsing buildings. He was previously an intern and fellow for Espaillat and Council Member Shaun Abreu, respectively. All three of those candidates have qualified for and received public matching funds, though Sanchez has the lead in donations. Though Sanchez will likely benefit from incumbent advantages including institutional endorsements, Cabrera shouldn’t be underestimated. In the 2021 Democratic primary for Bronx borough president in which he came in a close second, performing particularly well in University Heights and Kingsbridge Heights. Council Member Darlene Mealy – also a formerly term-limited council member who later ousted her successor for a second tour in the council – is among Cabrera’s donors, as is Assembly Member Al Taylor. John Maynard Harris and Evette Wilson have also opened committees to run in the district. – Annie McDonough Further reading: How Rep.

Incumbent: Open seat. Salamanca is term-limited, and he’s running for borough president. Candidates: Freddy Perez (Democrat), Justin Sanchez (Democrat), Elvis Santana (Democrat), Antirson Ortiz (Democrat), Jasmine Uribe (Democrat) District demographics: 65% Hispanic, 29% Black, 2% white, 1% Asian Voter enrollment: 77% Democrat, 4% Republican, 16% unaffiliated What’s the deal? Outgoing City Council Member Rafael Salamanca is the council’s powerful Land Use Committee chair, and his tenure has been marked by significant development of affordable housing in the district. Salamanca, who is Puerto Rican, is challenging incumbent Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, the first Black woman to hold the seat. He is backing business owner Freddy Perez in the race to replace him in the council. Perez, who is a district leader and runs a party supply business, is partly distinguished in the race by his age. At 59, he’s the lone Gen X competing against a few younger folks, including state Sen. Nathalia Fernandez’s chief of staff Justin Sanchez . Sanchez was formerly president of the Stonewall Democratic Club, one of the city’s LGBTQ+ political clubs, and he currently leads the pack in fundraising and spending. Plus, he’s clinched the support of the Bronx County Democratic machine. The popular former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. has donated to both Perez and Sanchez. Elvis Santana came up through the Estella B. Diggs Democratic Club and has backing from mayoral candidate and former Assembly Member Michael Blake. Director of Constituent Services at the city comptroller’s office Antirson Ortiz is currently a state committee member and is close with mayoral candidate Scott Stringer. Perez, Sanchez, Santana and Ortiz have all received public matching funds. Entrepreneur Jasmine Uribe is also running, but so far doesn’t seem to have gained much traction. – Holly Pretsky District 17: Bronx neighborhoods of Melrose, Hunts Point, Longwood, Morrisania, Crotona Park East Incumbent: Open seat.

Incumbent: Open seat. Francisco Moya is term-limited. Candidates: Sandro Stefano Navarro (Democrat), Erycka Montoya (Democrat), Hiram Monserrate (Democrat), Shanel Thomas-Henry (Democrat), Yanna Henriquez (Democrat) District demographics: 75% Hispanic, 12% Asian, 8% Black, 4% white, 1% other Voter enrollment: 70% Democrat, 23% unaffiliated, 7% Republican What’s the deal? Just about every local political leader in this diverse, heavily immigrant district has their opinion on who they’d like the next City Council member to be – with the exception of term-limited City Council Member Francisco Moya, who has yet to endorse a candidate. That means a competitive Democratic primary. Progressive Assembly Members Catalina Cruz and Jessica González-Rojas are backing Erycka Montoya , who works in intergovernmental affairs with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams’ office. Mayoral candidate state Sen. Jessica Ramos is backing her district director Sandro Stefano Navarro , an Army National Guard veteran. Embattled former lawmaker Hiram Monserrate , a previous representative of the district, and nonprofit worker and district leader Yanna Henriquez are also running, though neither have been endorsed by any local elected officials. LaGuardia Redevelopment Program public information liaison Shanel Thomas-Henry , a member of the local community board, has run a strong campaign so far. Despite only recently entering the race, she’s already raised at least $43,000 in private donations – more than any other candidate – and qualified for roughly $133,000 in public matching funds. Recently-retired Queens Assembly Member Jeffrion Aubry is among those who donated to her campaign. Given that the district is heavily Latino, securing the support of Latino local leaders could be particularly important for Thomas-Henry, who is Black. All of the other leading candidates are Latino. She along with Montoya and Navarro scored a recent endorsement from the Working Families Party. Monserrate, who has been heavily involved in an ongoing campaign to fight crime on the Roosevelt Avenue Corridor, has the second largest fundraising haul with roughly $35,600 raised. While he has the greatest name recognition, he’s also got the most baggage – like being booted from the state Senate in 2010 after he assaulted his then-girlfriend and pleading guilty to felony mail fraud charges. Even though most of Monserrate’s previous comeback attempts have failed, he’s been a district leader since 2018, proving he clearly still has political capital. Montoya has raised just shy of $27,000, Navarro a little over $19,00, and Henriquez roughly $18,000. – Sahalie Donaldson Further reading: In the race to replace Francisco Moya, everyone has a candidate District 21: Queens neighborhoods of East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and Corona Incumbent: Open seat.

The chief of staff to council member pipeline is tried and true . Tyrell “Ty” Hankerson , chief of staff and longtime staffer to Speaker Adrienne Adams, is certainly hoping the pattern follows for him this June, where he and three others are running in the Democratic primary for the seat Adams will vacate due to term limits. Hankerson, born in South Ozone Park, has clear ties to the Southeast Queens district, but working for Adams has provided a direct line and experience working with constituents – a fact his campaign will emphasize. But he’s not the only one with those ties. Latoya LeGrand , a nonprofit founder, education committee chair on Community Board 12, and the constituent services representative for Assembly Member Vivian Cook, is also running. Cook has yet to endorse in the race, and Hankerson has garnered some of the major local endorsements so far including Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and the Queens County Democratic Party. Between the two, Hankerson also has he lead in private donations. But Hankerson and LeGrand have company. Romeo Hitlall , a community board member and respected Lion’s Club leader, and Japneet Singh , a former challenger to Adams who has raised a strong $30,000 in private donations, make the race all the more competitive. Singh, Hitlall, Hankerson and LeGrand have all received public matching funds, though Singh has received the most. Some observers expect the vote to split along ethnic lines; Hankerson and LeGrand are both Black and have ties to the southeastern part of the district, while Hitlall and Singh are expected to mobilize Indo-Caribbean and Sikh communities, respectively, in South Ozone Park and Richmond Hill. All campaigns, however, say they expect to have support in every part of the district. While Hankerson’s work and close alignment with Adams is expected to work in his favor in many ways – her endorsement was a given – some of his challengers will argue that the district needs change, and could stir up dissatisfaction with hot-button votes under Adams, including the City of Yes housing plan and How Many Stops Act. – Annie McDonough Further reading: Adrienne Adams’ staffer wants to succeed her.

He’s a registered Democrat, but he’s co-chair of the council’s conservative Common Sense Caucus and has run on the Republican line (and several other party lines) in his elections to the City Council. He’s backing two staffers in two different primaries – Republican Alicia Vaichunas and Democrat Phil Wong – to replace him. Holden’s move underscores a rare truth in this city: The November general election in District 30 will be competitive. In the Democratic primary, United Federation of Teachers operative Dermot Smyth , who has spent years maneuvering the powerful union’s political endorsement process, has virtually unmatched backing from elected officials across the city. Smyth also has a significant fundraising lead, with more than $62,000 in private funds raised as of mid-January. Wong, a vocal education activist who has fought to preserve the city’s gifted and talented programs as well as the specialized high school admission test, joined Holden’s office in 2023 as constituent services and budget director. He hasn’t disclosed fundraising yet. Middle Village roller hockey league leader Paul Pogozelski , who has raised a respectable $11,000 in private donations, is also in the race. Vaichunas has worked with Holden since she ran his first race for council, and she is now his deputy chief of staff. She’s running with county GOP support and has received a donation from neighboring Republican Queens City Council Member Joann Ariola. Along with Smyth and Pogozelski, Vaichunas has received public matching funds. In the Republican primary, she faces MAGA perennial candidate Jonathan Rinaldi , who has not fundraised in any meaningful way.

This diverse, sprawling district with large Latino and Asian immigrant populations has been redrawn since City Council Member Alexa Avilés first won it in 2021. It now includes areas in southern Brooklyn that voted for Donald Trump in November: Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst. In 2021, Avilés, who was backed by Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party, won her general election with a 60-point margin. In 2023, after redistricting, that margin shrank considerably to 33 points. But before she gets to the general election this year, the DSA- and WFP-endorsed council member, who chairs the Immigration Committee, is facing a serious primary challenge. Ling Ye , a Chinese American moderate Democrat, has worked for Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Nydia Velázquez as well as former District 38 Council Member Carlos Menchaca. Ye is running toward the center, saying Avilés’ left-wing ideology has gotten in the way of her ability to advocate for her constituents. She cited Avilés’ decisions to vote against the New York City budget three years in a row as an example. Avilés has also spoken in support of Palestinian liberation, exposing her to the ire of pro-Israel interests and the conservative New York Post. Ye is already backed by the pro-Israel Solidarity PAC. It’ll be a tough race, but Avilés’ office is known for being active in the district, and her incumbency advantage remains strong. On the Republican side, banking program manager and community yoga teacher Luis Quero is running on a public safety platform, and so far isn’t facing a primary challenge. Quero also wants to roll back bail reforms, block luxury condos from the district and tackle deed theft. – Holly Pretsky District 38: Brooklyn neighborhoods of Red Hook, South Slope, Sunset Park, Borough Park, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Bath Beach Incumbent: Alexa Avilés (Democrat) Challengers: Ling Ye (Democrat) District demographics: 37% Hispanic, 32% Asian, 25% white, 4% Black Voter enrollment: 63% Democrat, 11% Republican, 23% unaffiliated What’s the deal?

Incumbent: Shahana Hanif (Democrat) Challenger: Maya Kornberg (Democrat) District demographics: 60% white, 15% Hispanic, 13% Asian, 6% Black Voter enrollment: 76% Democrat, 6% Republican, 15% unaffiliated What’s the deal? Both Council Member Shahana Hanif and challenger Maya Kornberg say that their primary election shouldn’t be about Israel or the war in Gaza. The New York City Council has no real power to influence the conflict. But in the Democratic primary in one of the city’s bluest City Council districts, that subject continues to come to the forefront. It’s also drawn some support to Kornberg, a Jewish academic whose work has centered on democratic governance and political violence, and whose most recent post is as a senior research fellow at the Brennan Center. Hanif is a Democratic socialist and the first Muslim woman to be elected to the City Council, where she is a co-chair of the Progressive Caucus. She previously worked for her predecessor in the office – mayoral candidate and City Comptroller Brad Lander. Hanif, along with some of her colleagues in the Progressive Caucus, has been vocal in calling for a ceasefire. Some Jewish members of the district and around the city have harshly criticized Hanif for not condemning Hamas’ attacks soon enough or being responsive enough to antisemitic incidents in the district. And some of those voices are mobilizing to ensure Hanif doesn’t get another term. Solidarity PAC, a pro-Israel committee that endorsed several other candidates around the city, is backing Kornberg. Kornberg, a self-described “pragmatic progressive” who in January notably called for outside groups to stay out of the race, has targeted her criticism on Hanif’s constituent services and her past calls to defund the NYPD. Kornberg has notched support from two Democratic clubs in the district: Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats and Independent Neighborhood Democrats. Hanif carries distinct incumbent advantages, including that many parts of the district are deeply liberal, and endorsements from the Working Families Party and local elected officials including Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. Both Hanif and Kornberg have raised substantial private donations and received public matching funds. Another candidate, Luke Saghir, also opened a committee to run in the district but has not been fundraising. – Annie McDonough Further reading: Amid reelection battle, Shahana Hanif lands a heated rezoning deal Shahana Hanif talks reelection campaign, and why she’s not seeking DSA endorsement Maya Kornberg pitches ‘pragmatic progressivism’ in Brooklyn council race These NYC Council challengers are fundraising aggressively District 39: Brooklyn neighborhoods of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and the Columbia Waterfront Incumbent: Shahana Hanif (Democrat) Challenger: Maya Kornberg (Democrat) District demographics: 60% white, 15% Hispanic, 13% Asian, 6% Black Voter enrollment: 76% Democrat, 6% Republican, 15% unaffiliated What’s the deal?

The PACs were indeed different, though financial firm founder Michael Jenkins was involved in both. In District 30, the name of Paul Pogozelski’s hockey league has been corrected. In District 28, we’ve removed a misleading characterization of endorsements. In DIstrict 13, an editing error mischaracterizing the timeline of Kristy Marmorato's election has been corrected. Share This:     NEXT STORY: State Sen.

Lewis | April 16, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 16, 2025 News & Politics Campaigns & Elections Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda New York State Democrats still appear to be riding high on President Donald Trump’s decision to pull Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be United Nations ambassador, with Gov. Kathy Hochul telling party officials that she views Stefanik’s North Country seat as a prime pickup opportunity as Stefanik reportedly considers running for Hochul’s position. Hochul kicked off a closed-door virtual state Democratic Committee meeting Tuesday evening by celebrating Democrats’ successes in last year’s New York congressional races and looking towards the future. “I think we can win, not just the seats we won last year, hold on to all those, but also we're going to have some pickups,” Hochul said. There are a couple of seats that Democrats targeted in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island last year where they came up short that would make sense as renewed targets. Rep. Mike Lawler, who is openly considering a run for governor against Hochul, still represents a swing district that on paper should be favorable to Democrats. And headway made with victories in nearby districts could embolden Democrats to take on Rep. Nick Lalota again. But Hochul mentioned neither of those candidates, nor Staten Island’s Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, another perennial target for Democrats. Instead, she looked north. “If you're living in Elise Stefanik’s district and you're a Republican farmer where someone in a small community is not getting the tourism they used to get from Canada – tourism is such an important part of this state – we're going to win a seat up there,” the governor said. “I know we are, because people, Republicans, have had it with their own party ruining their lives.” A spokesperson for Hochul’s campaign told City & State that the governor sees all Republican-held congressional seats, including Stefanik’s, as potential pick-up opportunities. “The Governor has made it clear that every Republican seat in the state is in play for 2026,” Jen Goodman said. “New York House Republicans are failing their constituents by raising costs for working families, gutting health care, and putting Social Security on the chopping block. Every single one of them is vulnerable because of their reckless decisions in Washington, and voters across New York will hold them accountable in 2026.” Stefanik has represented the 21st Congressional District since 2015, handily winning reelection year after year. Although Democrats have represented the district in the past – Stefanik’s own predecessor was a Democrat – the seat has become increasingly Republican to the point that while she remains in the seat, it has not been viewed as competitive. Stefanik herself has also increased her profile and influence since first getting elected, serving as the fourth-most powerful House Republican between 2021 and 2025 as chair of the House Republican Conference. Last year, her national profile got even bigger thanks to her role in committee hearings on antisemitism on college campuses, where she grilled Ivy League presidents. She was also a prominent Trump surrogate. After winning the election, Trump nominated Stefanik to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but doing so would have left her seat empty for a short period of time and diminished Republicans’ narrow majority in the House. Matters became further complicated as Democrats in Albany quietly considered legislation that would have granted the governor more time before calling a special election to replace Stefanik, thus leaving the seat open for longer. A multi-candidate race was also becoming increasingly likely, with Republicans and the state Conservative Party likely to run different people and an expected independent campaign from business owner Anthony Constantino splitting the right-wing vote. Democrats, on the other hand, had coalesced around farmer Blake Gendebien, who could have benefited from the crowded race. Trump ultimately pulled Stefanik from consideration last month, blowing up the special election political calculus. Now, NBC News reports that Stefanik is considering running for governor next year, which would throw the campaign for her seat into chaos once again. After Hochul spoke, state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs praised upstate county leaders for choosing “a great candidate” – though he did not mention Gendebien by name. “They actually scared Donald Trump off from appointing Elise Stefanik to the position at the United Nations,” Jacobs said. “So the next up will be a general election, of course. And as I said, great candidate, great effort, and that's really the way our team needs to work together.” Stefanik’s team brushed off both Hochul’s and Jacobs’ comments. “Kathy Hochul is the least popular elected official in the North Country by a long shot, so her statements are totally dismissed by North Country voters,” said Alex DeGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik. “This happens every cycle like clockwork, and every cycle, Elise Stefanik mops the floor of every Democrat they’ve ever run against her, often by the largest margin in the Northeast, and Elise consistently put up more votes than any candidate in the history of the North Country.” Stefanik didn’t rule out the potential of running for governor while speaking with the Times Union last week. She has long been considered a strong choice if she ever chose that route, but the prospect has never been seriously considered. Stefanik spoke last night at the annual state GOP gala in Manhattan, where Politico New York reported that the 2026 governor’s race was a hot topic of conversation as rumors about Stefanik’s political future begin to pick up. Gendebien spokesperson Georgia Greenleaf welcomed the comments from the state’s leading Democrats, while taking aim at Stefanik. “After Trump was spooked into canceling the NY-21 special, it looks like Democrats and Republicans are finally in agreement about something: Blake Gendebien is the person to finally deliver real representation for the North Country while Stefanik seems too busy launching her bid for Governor,” Greenleaf said.

Jefferson | March 21, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson March 21, 2025 News & Politics Albany Agenda Donald Trump New York State President Donald Trump has gotten himself and the U.S. in a tangled trade war with Canada while belittling its leaders and sovereignty. He’s focused on the possible return of economic activity his tariffs might bring, but business leaders are gravely concerned with what this might mean, not just for commerce but for the longstanding ties between New York, Ontario and Quebec. What happens if our friendly neighbors to the north stop seeing us as friends? In a fight nominally over border security, Trump has already issued 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods , including aluminum and steel, and 10% tariffs on energy, which have left states like New York, coincidentally under Democratic control and in his crosshairs, to brace for very real economic impacts as the country in general experiences fiscal headwinds. Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have expressed concern about how the trade war with Canada might affect the state’s agricultural industry and ratepayers’ wallets; The governor has directed the state Department of Public Service, Department of State and Energy and Research Development Authority to examine the full effects of the tariffs on New York; those agencies estimated that the cost of electricity could increase by $42 million per year and the cost of heating oil could increase by $57 million per year. New York politicians respond In Congress, members of New York’s delegation with districts bordering Canada have predictably split down party lines when discussing what the tariffs mean for their constituents. Democrats have hammered home both the negative economic impact on New Yorkers and how this will fray the centuries-long relationship between New York and Canada. “All these tariffs will do is destroy centuries of goodwill between our neighbors, create a new consumer tax on Americans who are already struggling to make ends meet, and cost jobs,” Western New York Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy said in a statement. “I am doing everything I can to pressure President Trump to stand down from his trade wars, otherwise hardworking families will pay the price.” Neighboring Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy characterized the tariffs as a necessary evil to compel Canada to take border security more seriously. “When they were going to feel it from the pocket, then they got serious about it,” he said in an interview with WRGZ . North Country Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik has been mum on the issue as she prepares to leave Congress to become U.N. ambassador. Relations between New York and Canada have always been pleasant, and business leaders want it to stay that way. North Country Chamber of Commerce CEO Garry Douglas said he suspects that Republican elected officials are privately communicating to the White House that the tariffs need to be reconsidered. According to Douglas, the North Country gets most of its building materials and farming supplies from Quebec, a large portion of its energy from Canada and all of its natural gas from across the border. He calls it a “post-trade relationship.” “I would equate anything less than a full reconsideration and reversal of these tariffs on Canada as being like the guy who was being hit on the head by a hammer every five minutes, and now he starts being hit on the head by the hammer every 10 minutes instead,” Douglas said. Chris Kirkey, director of the Center for the Study of Canada and Institute on Québec Studies at SUNY Plattsburgh, said it may fall on Hochul to remind the president of the economic realities of the situation. The governor has already met with Trump more than once since he’s taken office. “I would expect that Governor Hochul will in the weeks to come, if these tariffs continue to play out, increasingly voice concern about, is this the way to go?” Kirkey said. Kirkey warned that Canadian business and government interests will look elsewhere if they can no longer trust that New York, and the U.S. more generally, will be reliable trading partners. Newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney just visited the United Kingdom and France, and Kirkey said that trip wasn’t just about policy. “He's in Europe, in part, to sort of not only speak to his government's principal objectives but to talk to trade partners such as France and the UK about deepening trade relations and diversifying greater trade relations so that Canada isn't so overly reliant on the United States,” he said. “Sometimes it may cost you to do that, but if your trade partner is proving to be unreliable, well then you look elsewhere.” Maple Leaf fury Unsurprisingly, Canada hasn’t taken kindly to the tariffs or to Trump’s insistence that they should be annexed by the U.S. and become “the 51st state,” and Canadian politicians, businesses and consumers are struggling to figure out how to react to Trump’s belligerent attacks. The Canadian government has issued its own retaliatory tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American products and threatened to increase them further if need be. Ontario Premier Doug Ford all but declared war on New York, threatening to cut off power provided by his province before eventually walking things back and speaking to Hochul. Quebec Minister of International Relations Martine Biron has taken a more conciliatory approach, telling City & State in a recent interview that the relationship between New York will ultimately endure, even if the current geopolitical situation results in both countries facing temporary hardships. “The exchange with New York is about $11 billion each year,” she said. “So it’s important. It’s an integrated chain of supply, so we need to work together. And if the tariffs are on and we break this chain of supply, it’s going to be difficult on both sides of the border.” But Trump doesn’t see it that way. “With Canada, we don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything from Canada, and yet it costs us $200 billion a year in subsidies to keep Canada afloat,” he told reporters on Friday . “So when I say they should be a state, I mean that. I really mean that.” In fact, Ontario is one of New York’s most important trading partners. Daniel Tisch, director of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, is well aware of the gravity of the situation. “The interdependence is huge,” Tisch said. But he said that Canadian businesses and the public want a way to express their frustration with the U.S. government, and the most straightforward way to do that is with their wallets. Tourism is already seeing an impact from the trade war – and not just because the Canadian dollar is set to take a hit. “You see people saying, I'm not going to travel to the U.S., I'll stay within Ontario or Canada or go somewhere else. You see it growing by Canadian sentiment. You see boycotts,” Tisch said. “And so, you know, while I'm optimistic that at some point there'll be some sort of deal that's done, in some ways, the damage has already been done, and the reputation, the impact on the reputation of American goods and services, that'll take years to repair.” Even with the contingencies being mapped out , though, decoupling from New York isn’t the most immediately attractive solution for many. and although there's a border extending from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain, for some, like Michel Beval, president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Canada’s Quebec chapter, cultures and communities supersede that. “We are neighbors, we are allies. We're partners. We have a history together. Canada was there when there was the 11th of September,” Beval said. “When all those planes stopped in Halifax and different airports, Canadian families received people that were on the plane and they couldn't go to the United States, received them at their house. We fought with each other during World War Two, recently in Afghanistan. So with all of that history, I don't understand why we put tariffs.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Lander nets 504 Democratic Club’s backing Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one News & Politics New York caught in middle of Trump’s trade war with Canada Trump’s tariffs are alienating a key trading partner and driving up energy prices.

He calls it a “post-trade relationship.” “I would equate anything less than a full reconsideration and reversal of these tariffs on Canada as being like the guy who was being hit on the head by a hammer every five minutes, and now he starts being hit on the head by the hammer every 10 minutes instead,” Douglas said. Chris Kirkey, director of the Center for the Study of Canada and Institute on Québec Studies at SUNY Plattsburgh, said it may fall on Hochul to remind the president of the economic realities of the situation. The governor has already met with Trump more than once since he’s taken office. “I would expect that Governor Hochul will in the weeks to come, if these tariffs continue to play out, increasingly voice concern about, is this the way to go?” Kirkey said. Kirkey warned that Canadian business and government interests will look elsewhere if they can no longer trust that New York, and the U.S. more generally, will be reliable trading partners. Newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney just visited the United Kingdom and France, and Kirkey said that trip wasn’t just about policy. “He's in Europe, in part, to sort of not only speak to his government's principal objectives but to talk to trade partners such as France and the UK about deepening trade relations and diversifying greater trade relations so that Canada isn't so overly reliant on the United States,” he said. “Sometimes it may cost you to do that, but if your trade partner is proving to be unreliable, well then you look elsewhere.” Maple Leaf fury Unsurprisingly, Canada hasn’t taken kindly to the tariffs or to Trump’s insistence that they should be annexed by the U.S. and become “the 51st state,” and Canadian politicians, businesses and consumers are struggling to figure out how to react to Trump’s belligerent attacks. The Canadian government has issued its own retaliatory tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American products and threatened to increase them further if need be. Ontario Premier Doug Ford all but declared war on New York, threatening to cut off power provided by his province before eventually walking things back and speaking to Hochul. Quebec Minister of International Relations Martine Biron has taken a more conciliatory approach, telling City & State in a recent interview that the relationship between New York will ultimately endure, even if the current geopolitical situation results in both countries facing temporary hardships. “The exchange with New York is about $11 billion each year,” she said. “So it’s important. It’s an integrated chain of supply, so we need to work together. And if the tariffs are on and we break this chain of supply, it’s going to be difficult on both sides of the border.” But Trump doesn’t see it that way. “With Canada, we don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything from Canada, and yet it costs us $200 billion a year in subsidies to keep Canada afloat,” he told reporters on Friday . “So when I say they should be a state, I mean that. I really mean that.” In fact, Ontario is one of New York’s most important trading partners. Daniel Tisch, director of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, is well aware of the gravity of the situation. “The interdependence is huge,” Tisch said. But he said that Canadian businesses and the public want a way to express their frustration with the U.S. government, and the most straightforward way to do that is with their wallets. Tourism is already seeing an impact from the trade war – and not just because the Canadian dollar is set to take a hit. “You see people saying, I'm not going to travel to the U.S., I'll stay within Ontario or Canada or go somewhere else. You see it growing by Canadian sentiment. You see boycotts,” Tisch said. “And so, you know, while I'm optimistic that at some point there'll be some sort of deal that's done, in some ways, the damage has already been done, and the reputation, the impact on the reputation of American goods and services, that'll take years to repair.” Even with the contingencies being mapped out , though, decoupling from New York isn’t the most immediately attractive solution for many. and although there's a border extending from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain, for some, like Michel Beval, president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Canada’s Quebec chapter, cultures and communities supersede that. “We are neighbors, we are allies. We're partners. We have a history together. Canada was there when there was the 11th of September,” Beval said. “When all those planes stopped in Halifax and different airports, Canadian families received people that were on the plane and they couldn't go to the United States, received them at their house. We fought with each other during World War Two, recently in Afghanistan. So with all of that history, I don't understand why we put tariffs.” Share This:     NEXT STORY: Lander nets 504 Democratic Club’s backing Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one News & Politics Albany Agenda Campaign Confidential New York City New York State Campaigns & Elections Heard Around Town News & Politics Ask the Experts Announcements Policy Budget Criminal Justice Education Energy & Environment Ethics Gambling Healthcare Housing Immigration Infrastructure Labor Policy Publisher's Section Small Business Technology Transportation Personality Interviews & Profiles Personality Winners & Losers Power List Opinion Commentary Editor's Note Opinion NYN Media Nonprofits List Nominations First Read Sign up Featured Announcements Magazine Subscribe Issues Media Podcasts Videos Resource Directory Events Conferences Network Receptions Award Ceremony Past Events Jobs Products Why Post with Us About NY Nonprofit Jobs About Staff Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Use Merchandise Awards, Plaques & Permissions Follow Us     Help us tailor content specifically for you: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Yes, I want to receive occasional updates from partners I agree to the use of my personal data by Government Executive

Lewis | April 22, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 22, 2025 Budget Albany Agenda News & Politics Kathy Hochul New York State Speaking to reporters during the second week of April, Gov. Kathy Hochul suggested that New Yorkers don’t care if the budget is late. At the time, it was a little over a week past the April 1 deadline to pass a new spending plan. Lawmakers have now passed the seventh budget extender, as the budget is more than three weeks late. A new poll from Siena college suggests that average New York voters are in fact worried about the fact that the budget has not yet passed. Luckily for Hochul, though, many also indicated they’re chill with her holding it up over her non-fiscal policy priorities. On April 10, Hochul said that New Yorkers outside the state capital “aren't watching their clocks and their calendars” when it comes to the budget. “I'm not concerned about process, I'm concerned about results,” the governor said as she defended her fourth late budget in a row. It’s how state leaders have often defended late budgets in recent years – outside of the politically plugged in, most people care more about a good budget than one that passes on time. The new poll from Siena College suggests that isn’t necessarily the case. A vast majority – a whopping 72% – of voters surveyed from April 14 through April 16 said they were concerned about the fact that the spending plan had not yet passed. Among that, 31% said they were very concerned about the delay. And only 2% said they had no opinion on the matter. Hochul may have had a point that many New Yorkers are not paying close attention as only half said they knew that leaders had blown past the legal April 1 deadline for the budget. But once informed, they certainly indicated they cared. Still, the poll bolstered Hochul’s assertion that voters want a good budget more than an one that’s on time. Of the four non-fiscal policy priorities the governor has fought strongly, at least a plurality of voters said they agreed with Hochul holding up the budget to ensure they passed. A 61% majority of voters polled said they supported her bid to ban cellphones at schools. Of those, a plurality of 48% said Hochul was right to delay the budget over it. On discovery, a plurality of 43% of New Yorkers surveyed said they supported Hochul’s pitch to “clarify” the law governing evidence sharing in criminal trials. Of those, a majority 55% said that the governor should be delaying the budget to make sure lawmakers approve the changes. When it comes to expanding the state’s involuntary commitment laws, a plurality of 45% voters agreed with the proposal as well as agreeing with Hochul on holding the budget to include it. The only exception is Hochul’s late attempt to include a measure that would make it a crime to hide your identity with a mask while intimidating someone. Although a strong majority support the proposal, a slight plurality said that the governor should not delay the budget over it. And of the three, it is the policy that Hochul has seemed to publicly push for the least. Speaking to reporters over the weekend, she even suggested that the measure may get addressed during the legislative session outside the budget. The governor has made no similar concessions about her other three priorities. Although the poll shows that New Yorkers do care about a late budget, a spokesperson for Hochul still viewed the numbers as vindication for her position. “The numbers are clear: not only do New Yorkers support Governor Hochul’s agenda – they also agree it’s worth holding up the budget to fix our discovery laws, expand mental health care and create distraction-free schools,” said spokesperson Avi Small.

Lewis | April 17, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 17, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State The debate over discovery blessedly appears almost settled (barring a last-minute blowup while finalizing language), which hopefully means that the stalled state budget can finally start moving towards completion again. Legislative leaders and the governor had also managed to come to a tentative agreement earlier about banning cellphones in schools, which means they have two items down and… basically everything else left to go. On the policy side – much to the continued chagrin of Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who would prefer a straightforward spending plan – Gov. Kathy Hochul still has at least two more priority items she wants to get included: expanding the state’s involuntary commitment laws and enacting some version of a mask ban. Both have faced resistance in the state Senate and Assembly, much like the governor’s proposal to roll back parts of the 2019 reforms to the discovery laws. Although Hochul has recently spent much of her and her surrogates’ political capital and public appearances pushing the discovery issue, her team did put together a small press conference to discuss the involuntary commitment issue in Albany last week. It featured Dr. Ann Sullivan, commissioner of the state Office of Mental Health, as well as Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan and Albany County Executive Dan McCoy. “We hear from the mental health professionals that they need more tools… and we have far too many people who are dying on our streets,” Sheehan said. “Because let's put this out there – the alternative to the changes that the governor is proposing is that people will continue to die on our streets.” On the mask side, Hochul kept a potential ban out of her executive budget proposal released in January and only injected it to the conversation after budget negotiations had already begun. Supported by several civil rights and Jewish groups, the measure would reinstate a version of the state’s ban on wearing masks in public that lawmakers repealed during the pandemic. Supporters of the proposed ban charge that people are wearing masks in order to conceal their identities while intimidating others or engaging in hateful acts. They say that the issue has become more prevalent since the surge in pro-Palestine protests, although they are careful to say that the measure is not a response to any particular protest and is not meant to curb free speech. But opponents of the proposed mask ban like the New York Civil Liberties Union say it would have a chilling effect on protests and lead to disproportionate enforcement against people of color. The mask issue has deeply divided Democratic lawmakers in the Legislature, with some vehemently opposed and others advocating for it strongly. State Sen. James Skoufis, who sponsors the legislation that has served as the basis for negotiations so far, told City & State that he is “cautiously optimistic” that some version of the mask bill will make it into the final budget. As the budget talks have dragged on, other potential policy items have wormed their way into the discussion as well. As has happened in the past, opponents of the state’s substantial equivalency standards for private schools have quietly tried to include language to delay the implementation of new rules , or roll them back in other ways. The rules in particular affect yeshivas and have faced strong pushback from the Orthodox Jewish community. Legislators both for and against new changes suggested last week that the matter is not yet settled. Setting aside the rest of the finances of the budget, legislative leaders and the governor also have a $30 billion question to answer when it comes to funding the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s 2025–2029 capital plan. Officials have flitted around the question while making assurances that they’ll find the money and offering few concrete details. But at the very least, Heastie told reporters last week that he and his negotiating partners were close to agreeing on some form of tax hike to fund the plan. He described a menu of options at their disposal without disclosing where they landed, though a payroll tax hike on New York City businesses has emerged as the most likely option.

George Santos is set to get sentenced today for the litany of fraud he was convicted of. Prosecutors have asked for seven years, which unfortunately means that any potential papal candidacy that the famed fabulist might have considered probably goes right out the window. Outlandish, you say? With Santos, there is no such thing. New York’s Cardinal Timothy Dolan was more seriously floated as a longshot contender to be the next pope, which could bring some suicide humor to the Vatican. (No seriously, check out the Catholic Conference’s “13 Reasons Why” reference about Medical Aid in Dying.) Either way, Dolan is headed to Rome to participate in the best viral marketing campaign for a movie in history. But while the world is focused on the conclave in the Italian city, New York’s own Rome made some news this week too. WINNERS: Jeffrey Lanigan - While the world’s eyes will soon gaze towards the Roman sky for white smoke, another Rome is saying “we have yogurt!” Chobani will be opening a new $1.2 billion factory in Oneida County’s Rome . The 1,000 jobs that will be created are certainly music to Rome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan’s ears. An added benefit, the doubling of Chobani’s New York yogurt operation opens a new lucrative market for upstate dairy farmers. Maybe Roberto Gualtieri, mayor of the Italian Rome, should pay Lanigan a visit to talk trade. Adrienne Adams - One Adams is on the rise in New York City’s mayoral race, and it’s not Eric. Sure, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is behind in fundraising, stuck in the single-digit polling swamp and is running out of time to catch up to other candidates. But a major union endorsement from District Council 37 gave her campaign a jolt of energy this week, and Attorney General Letitia James will be hitting the campaign trail with her too. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, still dominates the polls and is swimming in dough. Jennifer Connolly - Preston High School Principal Jennifer Connolly saw her job – and the education of 600 students – saved this week when the philanthropic arm of Bally’s purchased the Bronx site as the Catholic charter faced closure at the end of the year. Think of the kids, right? And also maybe think of the casino license you’re hoping to get at your nearby golf course? That part feels…not as inspiring…but hey, the school is saved! LOSERS: Robin Dalton - What goes around comes around? Several years after texting a police chief during a Black Lives Matter protest to “arrest those fuckers” and to “please please please pretty please arrest someone,” former Saratoga Springs public safety commissioner Robin Dalton was arrested herself after allegedly shoplifting from a Walmart. While the BLM protesters were later vindicated by a report from the state Attorney General’s office deeming Dalton and other officials’ actions to be unconstitutional, stealing $100 of merchandise from the country’s largest retailer seems like far less noble of a cause to get arrested over. Michael Fisher - The Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, led by Bishop Michael Fisher, agreed to a $150 million settlement to resolve more than 800 claims of sexual abuse, with a majority of abuse cases involving clerics . While there are still final approvals remaining, the deal may begin to offer some closure for the victims. Fisher’s not a cardinal, so he won’t be among the 10 U.S. members of the papal conclave, which may or may not feature Ralph Fiennes this year. Sean Duffy - There's putting your cards on the table, and then there's giving the dealer your social security number. Federal attorneys in the lawsuit that will decide congestion pricing’s fate accidentally filed a document listing flaws in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s case. The mistakenly filed letter was eventually removed from the court docket, but it will probably be tricky for Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to make the case against the controversial tolling program when his own peers think it’s built on quicksand.

Jefferson | April 8, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 8, 2025 Budget Albany Agenda Policy New York State According to state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, state budget negotiations have hit a “pause” as policy debates gum up progress, even if they are at the “beginning of the end.” Gov. Kathy Hochul has indicated that her key priorities in the budget don’t have much room for daylight. Between discovery reform, involuntary commitment, a cellphone ban in schools and a mask ban, Hochul is willing to wait as long as it takes for a deal that meets her wishes, even as New York needs to answer pressing fiscal questions like funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s capital plan. She told reporters last week that “summers are nice here too,” referring to a prolonged negotiation in the statehouse. But Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie are essentially in a holding pattern until Hochul presents language they can bring to their members – leaving the state budget, now eight days late, at a standstill. “We want to get it done, but we want to do it the right way,” Stewart-Cousins told reporters Tuesday. “There's a lot of policy, as you know, being discussed, and actually, it seems that every day we have new policies being brought up. Like I say, nature abhors a vacuum. Apparently, budgets abhor vacuums as well.” Even now, new policy ideas are filtering in from the executive chamber. After Hochul and Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado’s very public split saw him leave the 2026 gubernatorial ticket, she put forth a proposal Monday to end the practice of gubernatorial and lieutenant governor candidates running in separate primaries. This is after she reintroduced a mask ban proposal, inspired by pro-Palestinian protests last year, in late March after it wasn’t in her formal budget proposal. “It does add to things that we have to talk about within this context of trying to close the budget,” Stewart-Cousins said. “And so as I said, it seems that the more it stays open, the more policies that emerge. And frankly, we are trying to close down the budget, and less policy would help.” Heastie has been adamant for years that he doesn’t want to see policy in the state budget. According to him, the cellphone ban in schools is a done deal , but discovery reform remains a stumbling block. This week, Hochul has enlisted district attorneys to help stump for her proposed changes to the law. Members of the Black, Hispanic, Puerto Rican and Asian Caucus have opposed the governor’s proposed changes to the law and suggested instead codifying a 2023 court decision , which they say would address prosecutors’ concerns about case dismissals without undoing the 2019 reforms to the law. Like Hochul, they are prepared to stay in Albany for as long as it takes to find a palatable solution – even if that means cancelling the Legislature’s planned two-week break to observe Passover. The job of negotiating the budget has been made even more difficult by the looming threat of federal cuts to the state budget. The state currently receives $91 billion from the federal government, and Stewart–Cousins reiterated on Tuesday that the state isn’t in a position to make up the difference if New York’s Republican delegation can’t persuade federal leadership to hold off on some of the more drastic cost-saving measures. “We as a state, cannot backfill these federal gaps,” she said. “We cannot. So there is no large amount of money that is going to backfill all of these cuts and all of the potential of the cuts. So we really need for our Congress members to do their job.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Lawmakers propose alternative to Hochul's discovery changes as budget negotiations drag on Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Budget State Senate leader: Budget negotiations on ‘pause’ Gov.

Lewis | April 10, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 10, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State Discovery Reform It seems at least one state lawmaker may be starting to get fed up with the budget delays around discovery and the alleged recalcitrance from district attorneys to negotiate over changes to the law. With details of those talks and proposed compromises still shrouded in mystery, state Sen. Cordell Cleare decided to introduce her own language on Wednesday. Just don’t read too much into it. Gov. Kathy Hochul, as part of her executive budget proposal, pitched tweaks to the discovery reforms approved in 2019. Although criminal justice advocates have argued that the changes would effectively allow for a wholesale rollback of the law , Hochul and prosecutors have said the amendments are necessary to address a stark increase in case dismissals in sometimes serious cases for what they call minor discovery infractions. Cleare’s new bill would codify the Court of Appeals decision in the case of People v. Bay . That 2023 decision established factors that a judge can consider when deciding on prosecutors’ compliance with discovery laws, which govern how and when prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense. It interpreted the current law to mean that a judge would not be required to automatically dismiss a case due to a discovery mistake if prosecutors exhibited due diligence and good faith in their efforts. Cleare’s legislation presents a number of factors that a judge can consider pursuant to Bay when deciding on whether a prosecutor exercised due diligence and good faith. Those include the extent of their efforts to comply with the discovery law, the amount of evidence already provided, the amount that is missing and the complexity of the case. “These factors provide a roadmap from which judges may fairly assess the prosecution's diligence,” a sponsor’s memo for the bill reads. The Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus – which Cleare belongs to – has advocated for adopting the Bay standard as a compromise on the debate around discovery. On Monday, caucus members rallied in support of the prospect. Assembly Member Michaelle Solages, the chair of the caucus, indicated at the time that she did not have specific language in mind yet, but she said she trusted legislative leaders to use Bay as “a guiding light” in negotiations. A spokesperson for Cleare referenced the caucus, and said that she consulted with other members about the legislation. “The position enumerated in the bill has been widely discussed for some time and the NYSABPRHAL Caucus (had) a Press Conference on it earlier in the week,” Chris LaBarge, Cleare’s legislative director, said in a statement. “Senator Cleare spoke to members/colleagues, advocates and practicing attorneys before introduction.” Solages did not return a request for comment about whether the caucus supports Cleare’s proposal. A spokesperson for state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said that Cleare introduced the bill independently and her legislation doesn’t represent the Senate Democratic conference’s current position on discovery. On the other side of the debate, district attorneys have said multiple times during recent trips to the state Capitol that while they support codifying Bay, that alone would not be enough. The prosecutors have pushed hard for Hochul’s proposal, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie charged on Tuesday that they haven’t been willing to compromise. The district attorneys want to add prejudice against a defendant as a third factor for a judge to consider on top of due diligence and good faith. It would allow a judge to determine whether the missing evidence has prejudice to the defendant, which they say is necessary to ensure that a case doesn’t get tossed over a minor piece of evidence that doesn’t impact the defense. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz suggested that prosecutors like herself might be willing to accept a codification of Bay, if that were expanded to include prejudice. She said that “Bay requirements plus the prejudice… sounds like the right way to go forward.” But Katz and other district attorneys have also emphasized the need to change the standard for discovery from all material “related” to a case, to all materials “relevant” to it. While the question of prejudice inherently goes hand-in-hand with a change like this, it would theoretically ease some of the burden and stress on prosecutors if the world of evidence they need to turn over gets narrowed. – With reporting from Austin C.

Lewis | April 3, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 3, 2025 Education Budget Policy Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul racked up her first budget win on Thursday after Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie told reporters that her bell-to-bell school cellphone ban was the first piece of policy mostly settled in the spending plan. But the budget is already three days late, and Hochul indicated she’s willing to go even later as she defended her fourth consecutive missed budget deadline. Much of the budget remains in a state of limbo as lawmakers go home for the weekend after approving a second budget extender, which will last through Monday. But Heastie said that, at the very least, the first of Hochul’s four top policy priorities is settled. “I would say cellphones is just about done,” Heastie told reporters Thursday afternoon, adding that he and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins had agreed to the governor’s original proposal “with some tweaks.” A source familiar with the state of negotiations also confirmed that the governor had reached an agreement with legislative leaders on the cellphone ban, one of her marquee policy items for the year. Hochul spokesperson Sam Spokony did not directly address the idea that the issue was settled, but reiterated her commitment to the proposal. “Governor Hochul has championed bell-to-bell policies to create distraction-free schools across New York, and looks forward to working with the Legislature to finalise a budget that meets the needs of all New Yorkers,” Spokony said in a statement. Heastie’s comments were the most concrete update to the state of budget negotiations that any of the three top state leaders have offered in the last few weeks, and certainly since missing the April 1 deadline. Talks have largely stalled as Hochul has dug in on her policy priorities. Aside from the phone ban, the governor is seeking to change the discovery laws that govern when prosecutors must share evidence with defense attorneys, to strengthen the state’s involuntary commitment laws and to enact some version of a mask ban . The discovery debate has sucked much of the oxygen from the negotiating room, and progress on it would greatly propel budget discussions forward. Using the solar system as a metaphor, Heastie said that the Legislature is currently on Neptune – the planet furthest from Earth – in terms of how close a budget deal is. “But I believe if we can resolve discovery… we can be on Mars,” he said. Hochul was much more tight-lipped when she spoke to reporters on Thursday, the first time she has taken questions from the Albany press corps in nearly two weeks. “I’m not going to tell you,” Hochul said when asked about the status of various budget items, “because that’s not how you negotiate.” The governor has often said that she will not negotiate in public, leaving the status of the budget incredibly opaque until she finally announces a deal. But the governor said she is “truly not in any rush” to get the spending plan passed, even though it is already several days late. Since taking office in 2021, Hochul has never had an on-time budget, with the budget being passed as late as May in 2023. On Thursday, the governor wouldn’t even give a rough estimate of when officials might finish this year. “I know that some of the legislators may be anxious to hit certain vacation plans, but I'm not going anywhere,” Hochul said. “I don't make vacations, so I'll be here to see this through.” The fiscal year begins in New York on April 1, giving the governor and lawmakers a statutory deadline to approve a spending plan. But Hochul seems content to treat that deadline more as a suggestion than a requirement, if it means she can get her preferred policy items into the budget. “If I was hung up on the deadline, we would not have the budget that I believe in my heart is the best budget for the people of New York,” she said. Delaying the budget has succeeded in delivering several policy wins in the past few years, including rollbacks to the landmark 2019 reforms to the state’s bail laws and the passage of a major housing package. “April 1 is a great date,” Hochul said. “I'd love to hit it, but I am very successful in overtime.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Bill to limit taxpayer funding of Cuomo’s legal fees worries public sector unions Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Education State leaders agree to school cellphone ban as rest of budget remains in limbo Legislative leaders and Gov.

But the governor said she is “truly not in any rush” to get the spending plan passed, even though it is already several days late. Since taking office in 2021, Hochul has never had an on-time budget, with the budget being passed as late as May in 2023. On Thursday, the governor wouldn’t even give a rough estimate of when officials might finish this year. “I know that some of the legislators may be anxious to hit certain vacation plans, but I'm not going anywhere,” Hochul said. “I don't make vacations, so I'll be here to see this through.” The fiscal year begins in New York on April 1, giving the governor and lawmakers a statutory deadline to approve a spending plan. But Hochul seems content to treat that deadline more as a suggestion than a requirement, if it means she can get her preferred policy items into the budget. “If I was hung up on the deadline, we would not have the budget that I believe in my heart is the best budget for the people of New York,” she said. Delaying the budget has succeeded in delivering several policy wins in the past few years, including rollbacks to the landmark 2019 reforms to the state’s bail laws and the passage of a major housing package. “April 1 is a great date,” Hochul said. “I'd love to hit it, but I am very successful in overtime.” Share This:     NEXT STORY: Bill to limit taxpayer funding of Cuomo’s legal fees worries public sector unions Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one News & Politics Albany Agenda Campaign Confidential New York City New York State Campaigns & Elections Heard Around Town News & Politics Ask the Experts Announcements Policy Budget Criminal Justice Education Energy & Environment Ethics Gambling Healthcare Housing Immigration Infrastructure Labor Policy Publisher's Section Small Business Technology Transportation Personality Interviews & Profiles Personality Winners & Losers Power List Opinion Commentary Editor's Note Opinion NYN Media Nonprofits List Nominations First Read Sign up Featured Announcements Magazine Subscribe Issues Media Podcasts Videos Resource Directory Events Conferences Network Receptions Award Ceremony Past Events Jobs Products Why Post with Us About NY Nonprofit Jobs About Staff Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Use Merchandise Awards, Plaques & Permissions Follow Us     Help us tailor content specifically for you: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Yes, I want to receive occasional updates from partners I agree to the use of my personal data by Government Executive

Kathy Hochul has said that she’s willing to hold up the state budget for as long as it takes to get legislative leaders to agree to her policy proposals – but most City & State readers expect the budget to be wrapped up in the next couple weeks. More than 380 people entered City & State’s 2025 state budget poll, with guesses ranging from April 10 at the earliest to Aug. 8 at the latest. The poll was first made available on April 9, and two sunny-eyed optimists predicted that the budget would be finished the very next day – only to soon be disappointed. The most popular guess was April 30 (with 31 guesses), closely followed by April 25 and April 29 (with 28 guesses each) and April 24 and May 2 (with 22 guesses each). Most readers expect that the budget will be finalized in the last week of April. In fact, more than a third of all guesses were for somewhere between April 24 and April 30. Bizarrely, though, only two people guessed that the budget would be finished specifically on April 27. If budget negotiations drag into May, as City & State has reported they might, readers expect them to be wrapped up relatively quickly in the month. Of the 133 people who guessed that the budget would be finished some time in May, 51 guessed it would be finished between May 1 and May 3.

Kathy Hochul has said that she’s willing to hold up the state budget for as long as it takes to get legislative leaders to agree to her policy proposals – but most City & State readers expect the budget to be wrapped up in the next couple weeks. More than 380 people entered City & State’s 2025 state budget poll, with guesses ranging from April 10 at the earliest to Aug. 8 at the latest. The poll was first made available on April 9, and two sunny-eyed optimists predicted that the budget would be finished the very next day – only to soon be disappointed. The most popular guess was April 30 (with 31 guesses), closely followed by April 25 and April 29 (with 28 guesses each) and April 24 and May 2 (with 22 guesses each). Most readers expect that the budget will be finalized in the last week of April. In fact, more than a third of all guesses were for somewhere between April 24 and April 30. Bizarrely, though, only two people guessed that the budget would be finished specifically on April 27. If budget negotiations drag into May, as City & State has reported they might, readers expect them to be wrapped up relatively quickly in the month. Of the 133 people who guessed that the budget would be finished some time in May, 51 guessed it would be finished between May 1 and May 3. Fortunately, few people seem to think we’re headed back to the bad old days of the Pataki administration, when budgets weren’t finished until the late summer. Only 11 people guessed that the budget would be finalized in June, July or August.

Adrienne!” at a major union endorsement rally on Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James stole some wind from the sails of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s inevitability campaign. Cuomo has been dominant in attracting major endorsements in the race for New York City mayor. Influential unions including 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council have in recent weeks backed the former governor, who’s polling with double-digit leads above any of his competitors. But District Council 37 – New York City’s largest public sector union that represents 150,000 members – broke up that pattern this week, endorsing New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. The nod gave her campaign a much-needed boost and one that offered her endorsers plenty of opportunity to take aim at the former governor. The union endorsed Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani as their second choice and state Sen. Zellnor Myrie as their third. In addition to James, Adams was also endorsed by CWA Local 1180 and Unite Here Local 100. After becoming the last candidate to enter the race , Adams is behind in fundraising and polling in the single digits . That puts her far behind not just Cuomo, but also Mamdani, who has maintained second place in most recent polls. Nearly every mayoral campaign has focused their ire on Cuomo as soon as he entered the race in March, if not earlier. It hasn’t seemed to make a dent in polls so far. Cuomo went before the union’s screening committee for their endorsement, executive director Henry Garrido said. “He made his case for why, in the same day and age as the Trump administration, he should be the solution,” Garrido said. “I think our members in the screening committee remained unconvinced.” Garrido made it clear the union members haven’t forgotten cost-cutting changes to the pension system under then-Gov. Cuomo that reduced benefits for some retirees. “Tier 6 is fresh on the minds of so many city workers,” he said. Asked if he was worried that by not endorsing Cuomo, the union would be at risk of Cuomo making the union’s life “hell” in future contract negotiations if he does become mayor, Garrido suggested that Cuomo’s vindictive reputation is exactly why he wasn’t their pick. “Actually what you just said is the prime example of why he’s not here,” he told a reporter. “I’m not afraid of anybody coming in here. I am here to represent the people who elected me to do what I think is right. This is what’s right.” James, who conducted the sexual misconduct investigation that led to Cuomo’s resignation, made thinly veiled comments that seemed aimed at Cuomo too. (Cuomo has denied the sexual harassment allegations against him.) “(Adams is) stepping up at a time of chaos and confusion. Not out of political motivation – or political revenge or even redemption,” James said. James also said she would be campaigning with Adams at Black churches – something she suggested “certain candidates” do in a bid for votes. “We don’t go to churches just around election time,” James said of herself and Adams. “We go to church every Sunday.” Cuomo has so far performed better than any of his rivals among Black voters in polls, and he’s received endorsements from Black clergy leaders. Some of his first public reappearances after resigning in 2021 were at Black churches. Asked about James’ comment, the Cuomo campaign referred City & State to a statement from Bishop Orlando Findlayter, the pastor at New Hope Christian Fellowship and a Cuomo endorser. Findlayter said that Cuomo “stood with the Black community during our most difficult days. …I hope Speaker Adams, as someone who understands the weight of leadership, will reflect on the importance of honesty and unity as we all work toward a better future for our communities.” Related articles Endorsements in the 2025 New York City mayoral race Myrie and Mamdani weren’t at the Adams-focused rally, but their campaigns told City & State they’re thrilled to have the union’s second and third-choice endorsements. “We look forward to hitting the trail with them in the future,” Myrie spokesperson Olivia Lapeyrolerie said. “We’re honored to have their support.” “Last night at our delegates’ meeting, we announced a whole slate of candidates that we will be supporting. But today we’re here to announce our endorsement for the next mayor of the city of New York: Adrienne Adams,” Garrido said. From fighting for funding for libraries and cultural institutions to helping to stave off layoffs at the Brooklyn Museum, Garrido said, “She was there for us at every single step of the way. We are going to be there for her when she becomes the next mayor of the city of New York.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Endorsements in the 2025 New York City mayoral race Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Politics DC 37, Tish James rebuke Cuomo in backing Adrienne Adams for mayor The endorsements give the City Council speaker’s campaign a much-needed jolt of momentum.

Jefferson | April 14, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 14, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget News & Politics Policy New York State Albany insiders think the state budget might drag into May as legislative leaders appear incapable of coming to a meaningful compromise on policy items after weeks of closed-door negotiations. Gov. Kathy Hochul said she wouldn’t mind spending her summer negotiating in  Albany , but so far it’s been a dreary spring. This wouldn’t be the first time that Hochul has delayed a budget until May; in 2023, the budget was held up due to fierce debates over rolling back bail reform and only passed on May 3. There are a few deadlines, legal and spiritual, that Hochul has to contend with as she holds firm on her budget goals. The first was April 1, the date that the state is supposed to have a budget in place – though it’s more of a suggestion than an actual deadline at this point. Hochul and the Legislature easily blew past that deadline. The next was Passover on April 12, which normally marks the start of a two-week holiday for the Legislature. But without an on-time budget, they’ll now be back in Albany passing temporary extenders for a few more weeks. At this point, the only people truly aware of the lack of progress are Albany politicos and state lawmakers who had to cancel a spring getaway. If there isn’t a budget in place by May 20, though, it will impact school boards in New York and the communities they serve, which will need to vote on their own budgets by then. Without a firm answer on Foundation Aid – the main mechanism to fund state public schools – districts will be in a sticky position and could be left wondering why they can’t get a firm answer on the resources they’ll have to work with. According to legislative leaders like Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, substantive work on the fiscal sections of the state budget has taken a backseat to policy debates, which have yielded little progress as lawmakers prepare to pass a fifth budget extender on Tuesday. There is talk that Hochul’s cheery outlook on protracted negotiations will lead to a budget that comes in noticeably later than last year’s April 20 agreement. Discovery reform is the main sticking point in budget negotiations, although an expansion of involuntary commitment and a mask ban are also gumming up the works. In her executive budget proposal, Hochul included changes to the state’s discovery law meant to address prosecutors’ concerns that too many cases were being dismissed on technicalities. The governor’s proposal would allow judges to impose less severe penalties for prosecutors who fail to turn over evidence on time and would also allow prosecutors to only turn over materials to the defense that they deem “relevant” to the case, rather than all material “related” to the case. Lawmakers and criminal justice reformers are concerned that the changes would create a more unjust legal system and reduce any impetus for prosecutors to act in a timely fashion, and some are prepared to dig in their heels. The dynamic is creating a situation where policies that the average New Yorker might not even know about, let alone fully grasp, are affecting their day-to-day lives and contributing to a sense of Albany’s inherent dysfunction. Blair Horner, senior policy advisor at the New York Public Interest Group, said that a budget so late that it calls back to the Pataki era – when the budget often wasn’t finalized until June or July – could set back public trust. “It is obviously an important component, not only to the schools, but to the communities that these lawmakers are elected from, and there's no getting around it,” Horner told City & State. “It makes Albany look bad. The budget being late makes Albany look bad. And it does throw a sort of body blow to the public's trust in their own government. They're supposed to get the budget done by April 1.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda State budget unlikely to be finished before end of month Will April policy debates bring a May budget deal?

Jefferson | April 18, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 18, 2025 Cannabis Policy Taxes Albany Agenda New York State The state Office of Cannabis Management has taken some lumps for its rollout of the legal cannabis market, raising concerns about its support for dispensaries and ability to enforce regulations in New York. But four years after the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act’s passage, one small town figured out a way to make the adult-use market work for them. Henrietta, a Rochester-area town with two cannabis dispensaries, generated about $750,000 in cannabis tax revenue in 2024 and is putting it back into the community. While decriminalization efforts and access to legal pot often take the forefront in discussions of the MRTA, the law also promised substantial local tax revenue – and New Yorkers are now beginning to see that promise realized. Henrietta Town Supervisor Stephen Schultz used the funds to hire an additional Monroe County sheriff’s deputy to help control speeding in residential areas and also plans to roll back property taxes for Henrietta residents next year. “The revenues from the cannabis tax far exceeded our expectations,” Schultz told City & State. “So now, not only can we fully fund the position, but we can now start to offset some costs that would normally be borne by our residents through property taxes. In fact, due to the high inflation, we had to increase the property tax levy last year. It was not a big increase, but it was our first increase in seven years that wasn’t tied to a ballot referendum, one to build the library and one to build the spray park, albeit six years apart. Had we known the amount of revenue we were to receive from cannabis, we could have eliminated that increase.” Other municipalities in New York that opted into the MRTA, like Kingston, have also discussed how to use cannabis funds once the revenue finally comes in. Over the past few years, issues with cannabis licensing meant that amassing the sort of tax receipts that Henrietta did was more of a pipe dream than reality. But towns like Henrietta, with its two adult-use dispensaries and more on the way, are now figuring out ways to address affordability and public safety concerns with cannabis tax dollars, in ways unthinkable just a decade ago. Schultz streamlined the process for dispensary owners like Martin to do business, and the town is reaping the benefits, even though the town did not opt in to allowing on-site consumption centers, coincidentally, because it could make the roads less safe. He even kept the location of MJ Dispensary and RISE, the town's two dispensaries, in mind. “We decided that, rather than stick these companies in an 'adult use zone' way off the beaten path, we chose a subset of our commercial district where there were no churches, parks, playgrounds or residences, and said they could set up shop there,” Schultzs said. ”I think that good retail visibility is why we have had a lot of shoppers in Henrietta as well as why the shops are doing well, since they are easy to get to and in a safe and well-traveled area.” Ryan Martin, the owner of MJ Dispensary, said that after the rough rollout of the legal market, it’s been heartening to see that the success of his store is having a positive knock-on effect on the community. Martin added his dispensary averages 15,000 customers per month and from the profit generated, 3% goes to the town and 1% to Monroe County. “I couldn't be more proud and blessed to be able to help out and help people see maybe no taxes raised, or even a possible reduction in taxes in the future,” he said. Given the history of the criminalization of marijuana, there’s some irony in the fact that cannabis tax revenue is now funding law enforcement positions, but the benefits for towns like Henrietta are undeniable and could be replicated across the state. “It's almost mind-boggling to me to come from the bottom, and now we're at the top,” Martin said. “We're just very, very thankful to be a part of this cannabis industry and promote the power of this plant, which has had this huge stigma on it for 70 years.” Share This: NEXT STORY: The discovery debate is almost done.

Kathy Hochul’s proposal to expand the eligibility of those eligible for early release from state prisons has prompted criticism from more conservative state lawmakers, but the state prison system proposed an even more sweeping expansion of eligibility for early release last year, City & State has learned. Currently, people who have been convicted of violent felony offenses are not eligible for the “merit time” program, which allows incarcerated people to earn time off of their sentence if they complete certain programs in prison. Since most people in state prison have been convicted of violent crimes, this means that only about 20% of incarcerated people are eligible for the “merit time” program. A “program bill” from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision that was shared with criminal justice reform advocates and lawmakers last year would have dramatically expanded eligibility to include all incarcerated people except for those convicted of sex offenses or Class A felonies (the most serious type of felony). A memo accompanying the program bill lays out why DOCCS believes that the expansion of merit time is necessary. “Expanding the pool of incarcerated individuals eligible for Merit Time will have several benefits: (1) encourage positive institutional adjustment; (2) increase the number of incarcerated individuals in treatment and work programs; (3) reduce idleness among the population; (4) lower violence in DOCCS facilities; and (5) enhance reentry opportunities,” the memo reads. “Sentence reduction is one of, if not the strongest incentive for good behavior and engagement in programs. These programs will not have their intended effect if 80% of the population are not able to access these incentives.” A spokesperson for DOCCS confirmed that the agency had released the program bill last year and stood by its recommendations to expand eligibility for merit time programs. “Governor Hochul has been clear that she will not allow anyone who demonstrates a public safety threat to be released early from prison,” Thomas Mailey, the spokesperson, said in an email. “While we cannot comment on pending legislation or ongoing budget negotiations, the Commissioner supports positive incentives that drive program participation and the reduction of violence within the facilities and ultimately our communities.” As part of this year’s budget negotiations, Hochul has proposed a more modest expansion of merit time eligibility. While the DOCCS proposal would only exclude people convicted of Class A felonies or sex offenses, the governor’s proposal would exclude people convicted of many more offenses, according to someone briefed on the proposal. Even the governor’s pared-back version of the DOCCS proposal has been controversial, though, with moderate Democratic lawmakers telling the New York Post that they do not believe incarcerated people convicted of violent crimes should be able to participate in programs that would allow them to earn an early release. Jess D’Amelia, a spokesperson for the governor, told City & State that Hochul’s proposal would only apply to a small number of incarcerated people. “Governor Hochul will not allow anyone who demonstrates a public safety threat to be released early from prison,” she said. “A proposal was discussed that would have granted near term merit time release to approximately 3% of the prison population – only if they have excellent disciplinary records and a plan to live a crime-free life outside DOCCS facilities. Under no circumstances will this Administration grant any special privileges to individuals convicted of murder, rape or other sex offenses.” Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers are backing the Earned Time Act , which would make all incarcerated people eligible for merit time programs no matter what they have been convicted of. The Earned Time Act, which is sponsored by state Sen. Jeremy Cooney and Assembly Member Anna Kelles, would also increase the amount of time that people can earn off their sentences by participating in programs. Currently, people eligible for merit time programs who are serving a prison sentence of a specific number of years can earn up to 1/7 off of their total sentence by participating in programs. That means that if they were serving a sentence of seven years, they could earn up to one year off. The Earned Time Act would allow people to earn up to 1/4 off their total sentences by participating in merit time programs. This article has been updated with comments from DOCCS and the governor’s office.

State leaders seem close to wrapping up the thorniest issues, including changes to the discovery law and involuntary commitment, which means that they can finally get to the billions of dollars on the table for the budget.

Kathy Hochul in January proposed a record $252 billion budget. The final spending plan will likely be even larger, even if only by a little, as the Legislature generally pushes for more spending than the governor – the state Senate proposed a $259 billion plan and the Assembly a $256.5 billion one. Of that money, roughly $91 billion is expected to come from the federal government. It seems increasingly likely that New York and other states should expect deep cuts to that funding stream – but without any specifics yet, leaders are content to take a wait-and-see approach to how to deal with it. On the executive side, both Hochul and her budget director Blake Washington have said that nothing the state does will be able to backfill federal cuts to crucial services. In New York, Medicaid stands to suffer the most, as that’s where most of the federal dollars go towards. “The only way you can really backfill on the state side is to cut services for other things, and you sort of modify spending across the platform,” Washington told reporters on April 1 , the day the budget was technically due. Legislative leaders have made similar statements. “There is no large amount of money that is going to backfill all of these cuts and all of the potential of the cuts,” state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said earlier this month. “So we really need for our Congress members to do their job.” Heastie has said that he won’t address the potential of federal cuts until they actually materialize – meaning that a special session later in the year to deal with those may be in the cards. “Since we've gotten nothing direct from the feds or the Republicans as to what they would cut, I don't know why I would do a budget that anticipates cuts that – I don't even know if the Republicans can do this,” Heastie said late last month. Even as the governor and legislative leaders continue their wait-and-see approach to both the recession and federal cuts, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli has released reports in the past month that included warnings about the state’s precarious financial future. In his March State Cash Report, DiNapoli said that the state had collected more taxes in the previous fiscal year than predicted in the governor’s January budget proposal. But he warned that economic growth may not last. “Policy decisions at the federal level, such as tariffs and federal aid cuts, are currently causing economic uncertainty,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “While the actual impact of these policies is unknown, the heightened risks they pose should be considered as the enacted budget for SFY 2025-26 is finalized.” The comptroller released another report this week that found that the state still receives slightly more money from the federal government than it receives, thanks to the last of the pandemic aid, but he said that is set to change, too. “Actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congress may cut health care, food assistance, infrastructure and other critical programs to the detriment of all New Yorkers,” DiNapoli said in a statement. “Major cuts in federal funding simply cannot be replaced by state taxpayers, will reduce the services the state provides and will exacerbate the long-standing history of New Yorkers sending more of their hard-earned tax dollars to the federal government than they get back.” Of course, some cuts have already materialized, with the state losing out on over $300 million for health and addiction services that had already been appropriated. New York and other states are fighting the cut in courts. According to the left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, the state has lost a total of at least $900 million already from federal cuts. The think tank earlier this week advised that leaders should proceed with caution when it comes to the state’s finances. “Many have criticized the late budget, but with an incredibly uncertain economic outlook and significant risks to federal funding, state policymakers have every reason to make slow and careful decisions,” Fiscal Policy Institute Director Nathan Gusdorf said in a statement. The group recommended increasing taxes on high earners in anticipation of federal cuts and opposed Hochul’s proposal to send out “inflation rebate” checks to most New Yorkers, arguing that there were better uses for a $3 billion tax surplus. Proceeding with caution is something that both sides of the ideological aisle can agree on, even if different groups disagree on the best path forward. The fiscally conservative Citizens Budget Commission similarly advised lawmakers to reject the governor’s proposed “inflation rebate” checks and to plan for federal cuts and a turbulent fiscal outlook. “The budget should set aside at least $2 billion to mitigate potential federal cuts and not spread $3 billion so thinly among taxpayers that it won’t help affordability,” Citizens Budget Commission President Andrew Rein said in a statement the day on April 1. In an op-ed from this week , the group’s director of state policies Patrick Orecki dinged leaders for allowing nonfiscal issues to take up all the air in the negotiating room. “The critical budget issues are how the State will prepare for potentially massive federal cuts and a possible recession, stabilize its precarious fiscal house of cards, raise and spend over $252 billion of taxpayer money, and improve New York’s affordability,” he wrote. But this is the easy stuff, apparently. “Like I said, we could probably knock out numbers in just a matter of hours,” Heastie told reporters last month.

Lewis | April 11, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 11, 2025 Budget Kathy Hochul Albany Agenda News & Politics New York State The king is dead, long live the queen. Gov. Kathy Hochul seemed to escalate the public rhetoric around budget talks on Thursday, taking barely-veiled jabs at her partners in the state Legislature and insisting that legislators needed a “strong individual” like her to get tricky policy done. Her new comments came after legislative leaders have similarly begun hinting at their frustrations more publicly than usual and as the delayed budget rolls into its 11th day past the deadline. At a testy press conference in her Albany office, Hochul reaffirmed her commitment to relaxing the state’s discovery laws and then highlighted policy achievements from her first three budgets to justify her fourth late budget in a row. It was proof, according to her, that a delayed spending plan was worth it if it meant forcing lawmakers to approve her agenda. “These are things that I have to put in my budget because they were not going to happen in the normal course of events, or at least the majority of them,” Hochul said. A governor has incredible control over the budget process, and both Hochul and her predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, took advantage of that fact to insert non-budgetary policy priorities in the spending document. It gives the executive leverage in ways usually not possible during the typical legislative process. On Thursday, Hochul characterized this as a necessity, asserting that she had to flex her power in order to compel the Legislature to get tricky or significant policy done. “They don't have an aggressive individual driving results, and that's me,” she said in reference to the Legislature. “I changed the culture.” And while New York voters elected their local officials to represent their interests, Hochul seemed to offer herself as the sole arbiter of the needs of New Yorkers. The governor said she has “respect” for individual lawmakers who represent their local districts, but she needs to “look at what 20 million New Yorkers want and what's important to them.” Hochul is certainly no stranger to contentious budget negotiations or fights with the Legislature. The state budget in 2023 got approved a little over a month past the April 1 deadline as the governor stood firm on making changes to bail reform, much like how she’s digging in on discovery now. That followed the state Senate’s historic rejection of her pick for the state’s top judge – a fight that grew so contentious that the governor at one point threatened to sue the Senate. But Albany observers agreed that her Thursday comments represented a notable shift in rhetoric, which has traditionally remained civil in public. One Albany insider called the governor’s tone “horrible” and predicted that her apparent disrespect for a coequal branch of government would come back to “nip her in the butt.” Another source noted that the governor has on some occasions spoken in a similar manner to legislative leadership during closed-door meetings, but she has never before used that tone in her public remarks. A different Albany observer said her comments were “a really unnecessarily provocative thing to say in the middle of a delicate negotiation.” And a fourth quipped that based on the comments, they believed the budget negotiations would drag on until May – of next year. A spokesperson for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie did not take too kindly to the governor’s words. “In 2024, nearly 800 bills passed both houses outside of the budget process addressing wide ranging issues affecting New Yorkers,” Mike Whyland, the spokesperson, said in a statement to City & State. “Clearly our members know their districts and they also know how to pass bills and get things done.” He added that Heastie has made it clear that his chamber is open to reviewing the discovery laws and doesn’t need to be “cajoled” into considering changes by putting them in the budget. A spokesperson for state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins did not offer comment. Heastie himself has been fairly direct and blunt with his budget commentary this year. He has never made a secret of his disdain for including policy in the spending plan, but earlier this week, he introduced legislation that would require legislators to be  paid during a budget delay if unrelated policy is included in the budget proposal. Right now, lawmakers don’t get paychecks until the budget passes, while the governor does. It was the first bill of its kind in recent memory and drew an icy response from Hochul’s office. The speaker has also openly expressed a degree of frustration over the negotiations over discovery, telling reporters this week that the Legislature had offered several compromises to Hochul and district attorneys, but that “at some point, we need them to compromise as well.” But Heastie has still made a point to broadcast that the legislative leaders and the governor were still working cooperatively towards a common goal and shared the same interests. “We are not trying to go to war with Gov. Hochul,” he told Spectrum News in an interview on Wednesday, also calling the governor “a good friend.” Hochul’s point about getting tricky policy done in the budget is not entirely without merit. For a long time, measures that may not have the votes to pass as standalone bills have gotten wrapped up into larger bills, whether the budget or an omnibus “big ugly” at the end of session. That provides some political cover to lawmakers who don’t want to be on the record voting in favor of a bill if their support is needed for passage, since another part of the bill usually contains something more favorable. But that is hardly the case all the time. For example, Cuomo tried multiple times to approve marijuana legalization in the state budget, which would give him the control to shape the program how he wanted. After it fell out of the budget more than once, the ex-governor all but dared lawmakers to pass the tricky legislation themselves. They did so as a standalone bill in 2021. Something similar happened when lawmakers approved sweeping rent laws at the end of the 2019 legislative session, another thorny issue that went unaddressed for much of that year. Since Hochul has taken office, lawmakers have also managed to approve long-stalled bills that for years had failed to gain traction. Three years in a row, lawmakers approved the 30-year-old Grieving Families Act to update the state’s ancient wrongful death laws. Hochul vetoed it each time. She did, however, sign the Climate Change Superfund Act last year, which lawmakers passed after several years and which was lauded as a major environmental victory by advocates. Hochul also signed the Clean Slate Act, which had been a major point of contention in Albany for several years and ultimately passed as a standalone bill in the Legislature in 2023.

Lewis | April 4, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 4, 2025 Albany Agenda News & Politics New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul has made a lot of political hay over her leadership of the state Democratic Party, emerging triumphant from victories at the congressional level and in other races across the state, and revitalizing the nascent party apparatus in the state. Just don’t ask her to weigh in on the decision of New York City Mayor Eric Adams – a one-time ally once seen as a potential standard bearer for the party on the national stage – to abandon the Democratic line in favor of running as an independent. After a federal judge officially dismissed the corruption case against him earlier this week, Adams announced that he would not run in the Democratic primary and would instead petition to appear on the November ballot as an independent. He made a point to say he’s not changing his registration and would remain a Democrat in the voter rolls, but he also was quickly seen alongside conservative influencers after his announcement. Asked about Adams’ change of heart – a decision made as he lagged far behind in primary polling, allies abandoned him for other candidates and amid stagnant fundraising – Hochul first tried to brush off the significance of New York’s second most prominent Democrat ditching the party. “One thing I love about my party, we have a lot of different opinions and voices and individuals, and I have to respect all of them,” the governor said in relation to her role as the head of the state Democratic Party. When City & State pointed out that Adams was no longer running as a member of her party, Hochul deflected. “People do what they need to do,” she said. “I will always run as a Democrat if anybody’s wondering.” The apparently flippant attitude belies her role as leader of the state Democratic Party, one that she takes great pride in during election season. She dedicated significant time, money and resources to help the party win back several House seats in 2024 after a disastrous 2022 for which national leaders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi blamed Hochul. She worked alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to support Democratic candidates and priorities, and she built out a state party that for years served mainly as another campaign arm for the governor. “There's never been a governor in New York State that took so seriously the title of leader of the state party,” Hochul declared on CNN last year, one of many cable news appearances she made to tout her efforts. Hochul seemingly was not wearing that hat when she spoke to reporters on Thursday. She insisted that she has “a lot more to do than worry about who's running for mayor today and tomorrow, (and on) what party line.” Which, admittedly, is true. She’s in the middle of negotiating the state budget, which is now several days late, and the state is anticipating deep federal cuts, among other issues of concern. “I’m not going to stand here and say, ‘Oh my God, he did something else,’” Hochul said of Adams. Adams’ decision isn’t the first time this has happened either, a fact that Hochul pointed at as well. She referenced former Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, a former head of the state Democratic Party who defied that same party after losing in a primary in 2021 and ran a write-in campaign against the Democratic nominee India Walton, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Brown’s decision at the time attracted controversy from progressives in the party, especially after state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs declined to endorse the nominee and instead tacitly compared Walton – a Black woman – to Ku Klux Klan leader David Dukes. Jacobs told City & State that he doesn’t have any thoughts now on Adams’ decision to run for reelection as an independent.

Jefferson | April 24, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 24, 2025 Budget Policy Taxes Albany Agenda New York State Two state lawmakers think taxing the stock market could plug future holes in the state budget and help fund major policy initiatives. State Sen. James Sanders and Assembly Member Phil Steck are reviving a push to reinstate a five-cent tax on stock trades that take place in New York. The bill is projected to bring in $14 to $16 billion annually, and Sanders and Steck view it as a possible defense as the federal budget is expected to slash funding for expensive state-run programs like Medicaid. Taxing stock trades isn’t new in New York. A five-cent levy on sales of stock worth more than $20 was in place from 1905 to 1981, when lawmakers eliminated it. Legislative proposals to bring it back have cropped up in recent years. In 2021, state Sen. Julia Salazar and former Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou attempted to reinstate the tax , but pushback from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the financial sector prevented any progress. Five years later, lawmakers making a renewed push for a stock tax face Gov. Kathy Hochul’s commitment to keep taxes flat. Her office told City & State that she would review the legislation if and when it passed the Legislature. The New York Stock Exchange did not respond to requests for comment. Recognizing the uphill battle to get the bill passed one day, Steck said it would take a wide base of support and financial peril to see any progress. “To pass this bill would require a movement, and I think unfortunately, would probably require dealing with a lot of federal cuts that are important,” Steck told City & State. “The governor is just too corporate-oriented to support this, and the speaker is afraid Wall Street will leave New York City.” Steck and Sanders held a rally Wednesday near the New York Stock Exchange with faith leaders, education advocates, economic experts and environmentalists. Sanders said it was essential to protect New York from the Trump administration’s potential funding cuts. “I think that we have a secret weapon for support in Albany. I think that we have an orange guy down in DC who is determined to make sure that New York does not have enough money to carry on the business of New York,” he said. “So I think that once we realize that he is kind enough to devastate us, we need to move in an affirmative fashion, and we need to make sure that our police are paid, that the fire department is paid, that the roads are paved and that education takes place.”. – With reporting from Holly Pretsky Share This: NEXT STORY: DOCCS wanted people convicted of violent crimes to be eligible for early release Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Budget Could a stock transfer tax help NYC weather the Trump administration?

Lewis | April 3, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 3, 2025 Taxes Andrew Cuomo Policy Albany Agenda New York State The eye-popping $60 million that New York state spent related to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s various scandals, including his legal defense, has prompted lawmakers to introduce legislation meant to curb excessive tabs on the taxpayer dime. But the bill wouldn’t apply only to the former governor – or even just to elected officials. It would apply to all public workers, and that has led public sector unions representing state workers to approach it with caution. Sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly Member Grace Lee, the State Taxpayer Oversight and Protection Act, or STOP Act, would expand the authority of the state comptroller to evaluate how state workers utilize taxpayer dollars in lawsuits related to their state work. Generally, the state attorney general’s office will represent state employees and those subject to the Public Officers Law, but in cases where it can’t, New York state will reimburse them for the cost of private attorneys. The comptroller currently has limited ability to reject the reimbursements, but the STOP Act would enable the comptroller to cut off the money if they determine that spending has become unreasonable. The clear impetus for the proposed legislation was Cuomo. “The way that Andrew Cuomo used the system for defense is extraordinary and was probably not contemplated when the law was written,” Lee told City & State. The ex-governor has hired multiple law firms to represent him in sexual harassment lawsuits brought by three different women, racking up millions of dollars in attorney fees. State Attorney General Letitia James recused herself from representing Cuomo, since her office investigated the sexual harassment claims against him, which means that the state has been on the hook for the cost of all of his attorneys. Cuomo has denied all of the allegations against him. The STOP Act would allow the comptroller to determine whether the costs covered by the state are “proportional to the needs of the case and consistent with the manner and methods of defense employed in similar or representative cases.” Hiring multiple high-paid attorneys from different law firms would automatically be considered “unreasonable” unless the state employee can make a compelling case for it. “This is really to ensure that we're not writing blank checks to politicians to support their legal defense,” Lee said. “I believe that everyone is due their day in court, but they shouldn't do it at the full expense of taxpayers.” However, the legislation is already raising some eyebrows within public sector unions who represent state workers and civil servants. The Public Employees Federation – which covers scientific, professional and technical state workers – said it has concerns about the bill. “As a union, we are looking at the STOP Act closely,” Rob Merrill, a union spokesperson, told City & State in a statement. “We have concerns that this will negatively impact the defense options available to our members who are sued while acting as agents of the state.” The state’s largest municipal union, the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, has not taken a position on the bill yet, but a spokesperson said that the union is reviewing the “potential impact, if any, on the state workforce represented by CSEA and will continue to monitor its progress in the NYS legislature.” A spokesperson for United University Professions, which represents State University of New York faculty and staff, confirmed that the STOP Act would impact its members if enacted and that its attorneys are reviewing the proposal. And a public sector union source said that labor groups have different levels of concern about the potential impacts of the legislation. Lee said that she has already spoken with CSEA and that PEF was in the process of reviewing the bill. She said that she doesn’t have major concerns about pushback from unions. “I believe that this bill will continue to ensure that people do have adequate defense, but ensures that no one is exploiting taxpayer money while they do it,” she said. But Lee also said that she is willing to discuss potential amendments to address any specific concerns raised by unions.

Lewis | April 24, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 Budget Housing Homelessness Policy Albany Agenda New York State State leaders are negotiating a potential deal to include a long-desired rental voucher bill in the state budget, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions. It’s the most serious that discussions about the measure have gotten since legislators and housing advocates started pushing for it in earnest several years ago. Talk of the Housing Access Voucher Program emerged as the state budget nears the one month mark in tardiness. Although the measure has widespread support from tenant advocates and real estate interests alike, Gov. Kathy Hochul has repeatedly declined to back the measure in the past over the price tag. Advocates have called for a minimum of $250 million to fund the program that would provide rental vouchers to people at imminent risk of eviction and those currently experiencing homelessness. They estimate the total cost of the program to hit about $1 billion, while the governor’s office has asserted it would cost the state as much as $6 billion to implement. Both the state Senate and Assembly have included the voucher program and $250 million of funding in their one-house budget proposals for several years. Without support from the governor, though, the measure has fallen off the table time and again. Now, multiple sources with knowledge of negotiations say that Hochul has expressed a new openness to discussing the program and the potential for finding a compromise to include it in the late spending plan. One source suggested that while the governor’s office may not be offering a “warm” reception, the fact that they opened the door at all is a big step forward compared to years past. Although legislative leaders are discussing the prospect of a deal, details on what exactly that would look like remain murky. The biggest question that remains unanswered is exactly how much money the state would dedicate to the program in the case of a compromise. None of the sources briefed on discussions could even provide a ballpark estimate of what the governor may counter with, if not the full $250 million that advocates and lawmakers have pushed for. The Housing Access Voucher Program has continued to rack up support from a variety of interests, even those that often find themselves on opposing sides on other housing matters. Both Housing Committee chairs in the Legislature recently published a joint op-ed with Real Estate Board of New York President James Whelan and WIN CEO Christine Quinn in support of the measure.

It’s the most serious that discussions about the measure have gotten since legislators and housing advocates started pushing for it in earnest several years ago. Talk of the Housing Access Voucher Program emerged as the state budget nears the one month mark in tardiness. Although the measure has widespread support from tenant advocates and real estate interests alike, Gov. Kathy Hochul has repeatedly declined to back the measure in the past over the price tag. Advocates have called for a minimum of $250 million to fund the program that would provide rental vouchers to people at imminent risk of eviction and those currently experiencing homelessness. They estimate the total cost of the program to hit about $1 billion, while the governor’s office has asserted it would cost the state as much as $6 billion to implement. Both the state Senate and Assembly have included the voucher program and $250 million of funding in their one-house budget proposals for several years. Without support from the governor, though, the measure has fallen off the table time and again. Now, multiple sources with knowledge of negotiations say that Hochul has expressed a new openness to discussing the program and the potential for finding a compromise to include it in the late spending plan. One source suggested that while the governor’s office may not be offering a “warm” reception, the fact that they opened the door at all is a big step forward compared to years past. Although legislative leaders are discussing the prospect of a deal, details on what exactly that would look like remain murky. The biggest question that remains unanswered is exactly how much money the state would dedicate to the program in the case of a compromise. None of the sources briefed on discussions could even provide a ballpark estimate of what the governor may counter with, if not the full $250 million that advocates and lawmakers have pushed for. The Housing Access Voucher Program has continued to rack up support from a variety of interests, even those that often find themselves on opposing sides on other housing matters. Both Housing Committee chairs in the Legislature recently published a joint op-ed with Real Estate Board of New York President James Whelan and WIN CEO Christine Quinn in support of the measure. Several high profile unions – including 32BJ, the United Federation of Teachers and DC37 – also sent a new letter to Hochul on Thursday offering their support for the program as well, marking the first time that labor has offered public, unified advocacy for the bill. – With reporting by Austin C.

Lewis | April 7, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 7, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Criminal Justice Policy New York State Discovery Reform Members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus rallied against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed changes to the state’s discovery laws on Monday, while two New York City district attorneys made a case in support of the measure. The prosecutors expressed an openness to compromise, and lawmakers said they’d support certain language to tweak the law to codify a court decision clarifying the statute. But a final deal on the issue, which has in part held up the state budget for over a week, still remains elusive. As part of her executive budget proposal in January, Hochul included changes to the state laws that govern how and when prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense. Her proposed language would modify the current law in a number of ways, namely by shifting from requiring prosecutors to provide the defense with all “related” to requiring all “relevant” evidence be turned over, and permitting consequences less severe than dismissal should minor or inadvertent discovery errors come to light after the speedy trial clock has run out. Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg spoke to reporters in Albany about the need for changes, reiterating their support for the intent of the initial 2019 reforms to make the discovery process more fair to defendants, while arguing that the reforms have had the unintended consequence of cases getting dismissed on technicalities or minor infractions. “We've been working really, really hard to come to a compromise in order to make some smart changes or tweaks to the law, so that we can avoid dismissals on technicalities,” Clark said. She added that the proposed changes are meant to “level the playing field for victims.” A number of victims rights groups have highlighted instances in which domestic or sexual violence cases were dismissed due to a minor mistakes related to discovery. Although current law provides a variety of remedies for such mistakes other than dismissal, violating the speedy trial law results in automatic dismissal. That means that judges have often felt constrained to dismiss cases if issues with discovery, even small ones, occur after the speedy trial clock has already run out or after a prosecutor has filed a certificate of compliance to stop the clock, according to the district attorneys. Clark said that “everything is still on the table” when it comes to negotiating a compromise in order to get the budget passed, adding that legislative leaders have made counterproposals to the governor. Clark did not provide any specific details on what those counterproposals look like, but suggested that prosecutors have “compromised on things already.” Shortly after Bragg and Clark spoke to reporters, members of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Caucus offered a counter-narrative, expressing strong opposition to the governor’s proposal and suggesting that they’d be willing to stay in Albany as long as it takes to prevent it from being approved. “We can fix the dismissal problems without dismantling justice,” said Assembly Member Michaelle Solages, chair of the caucus. “And we can protect all victims by making sure there's truth in every courthouse.” She and other lawmakers at the rally argued that the governor’s proposal would constitute an effective wholesale reversal of the 2019 reforms. Instead, Solages and others in the caucus said that they would support language that codifies a 2023 Court of Appeals decision in the case of People v. Bay . That ruling clarified in case law that a judge can impose less severe remedies for discovery mistakes even after a certificate of compliance has been filed and stopped the speedy trial clock, as long as prosecutors can prove that they acted in good faith and with due diligence. “Codifying the decision is what we need to do, not destroy the law,” Solages said, echoing an argument that New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams made last week . But lawmakers could not offer any specific details on what language would look like to codify that court decision or how it would differ from what the governor has already proposed. “Our leadership has our desires, and we're working with them – on both sides, in both chambers – to come up with language,” Solages said. “But at the end of the day, we have a court case that is a guiding light for this process.” Legislators also signaled that, like the governor, they’re willing to stay as long as they need to ensure that discovery is done right. “Summers are beautiful in Albany,” said Assembly Member Gabriella Romero, who represents the state capital – repeating the same line Hochul used last week when asked about how late the budget may go.

GEMG neither endorses nor is responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed in the Comment Areas by third parties. The opinions expressed in the Comment Areas reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of GEMG. GEMG is not responsible for any errors or omissions in postings in the Comment Areas, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will GEMG or its affiliates, be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information obtained through the Comment Areas or any other part of the Sites.

You acknowledge and agree that unless otherwise stated, all materials and information you post in the Comment Areas will be deemed to be provided to us on a non-confidential and non-proprietary basis. Content and Non-Endorsement Opinions and other statements expressed by users and third parties are theirs alone, not opinions of GEMG. Content created by third parties is the sole responsibility of the third parties and its accuracy and completeness are not endorsed or guaranteed. The Sites and third parties may provide links to web pages, web sites, and various resources or locations on the web. GEMG has no control over the information you access via such links, does not endorse that information, and shall not be responsible for it or for the consequences of your use of that information. Use of RSS Feeds Some of the Sites may provide an RSS feed (the “Feeds”). Individuals may use the Feeds free of charge - unless otherwise specified - for their personal, non-commercial use only. When using the GEMG Feeds, we ask that you provide attribution to the specific GEMG brand, including at a minimum a linked logo, a link that returns to the original URL and that you set the canonical tag to GEMG.  GEMG reserves the right to disable, to change, or to cease distribution of Feeds at any time, and reserves the right to require individuals to cease any and all use of the Feeds at any time for any reason. To request permission to make commercial use of the Feeds, please contact us at feedback@govexec.com.  GEMG will consider such submitted requests, but is not obligated to grant any specific permission request. Use of Syndicated Content Some of the material available on the Sites is provided by third party content services, such as the Associated Press. By using the Sites you agree and acknowledge that (1) you will not publish, broadcast, or rewrite for broadcast or publication, or redistribute directly or indirectly in any medium any third party text, photo, graphic, audio, and/or video material, and (2) no third party materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use. Third party content providers such as the Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions in its materials or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part of its materials, or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing. In addition to those set forth in this paragraph, the third party content providers  may impose other terms and conditions on the use of its materials. Employment Opportunities GEMG may post employment opportunities on the Sites and/or invite users to submit resumes to it. If you choose to submit your name, contact information, resume and/or other personal information to GEMG in response to employment listings, you are authorizing GEMG and its service providers to utilize this information for all lawful and legitimate hiring and employment purposes. GEMG also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to forward the information you submit to its corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, vendors and service providers for legitimate business purposes.

DMCA Copyright Infringement Claim Policy GEMG respects the intellectual property of others, and requires that our users do the same. You may not upload, embed, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that infringes any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.  GEMG has the right to prohibit infringers from using our Sites. If you believe your work has been copied and posted on or through the Sites in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send GEMG’s Copyright Agent a notification of claimed infringement with all of the following information: (a) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (b) identification of the claimed infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on the Sites (providing the URL(s) of the claimed infringing material satisfies this requirement); (c) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address; (d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and (f) your physical or electronic signature. GEMG’s Copyright Agent for notification of claimed infringement can be reached as follows: General Counsel, Government Executive Media Group, 600 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Suite 510, Washington, DC 20037, Phone: 202-739-8501, DMCA@govexec.com. Upon receipt of a Notification of Copyright Infringement from a copyright owner that contains the required information described in (a) through (f) above, GEMG will notify the user, if known, of the alleged infringement and remove or disable access to the material that is alleged to be infringing if hosted on the Sites.  No personal user information is shared with the copyright owner unless required by law. If GEMG receives more than one Notice of Copyright Infringement concerning a user, the user may be deemed a “repeat copyright infringer.” GEMG reserves the right to terminate the accounts of “repeat copyright infringers.” Procedure to File a DMCA Counter-Claim If you have received a notice of copyright infringement and you believe that a copyright holder has accused you in error, you may file a DMCA Counter-Claim with GEMG’s designated agent. To be effective, a Counter-Claim must be a written communication provided to GEMG’s designated agent and must include the following information: (a) A physical or electronic signature of the user; (b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (c) A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and (d) The user’s name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the user’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the user will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person. Upon receipt of a DMCA Counter-Claim, GEMG will provide the complaining party with a copy of the DMCA Counter-Claim. When GEMG receives a Counter-Claim that meets the requirements of the DMCA, GEMG will process the Counter-Claim in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA. Limitation of Liability and Use GEMG has worked to ensure the accuracy of the information it provides through its products and services, including through the Sites. This information frequently relies on data obtained from many sources, however, and GEMG cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information provided or any analysis based thereon.

Lewis | April 2, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 2, 2025 Immigration Criminal Justice Albany Agenda Policy New York State In the wake of the high-profile detention of a mother and her three children upstate by federal immigration agents, immigrant advocates are once again demanding that state lawmakers pass legislation banning jails and prisons in New York from contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It’s one of several measures that activists are pushing for, as New York officials have largely taken a hands-off approach to strengthening immigrant protections since President Donald Trump started his mass deportation efforts. The Dignity Not Detention Act would make it illegal for local governments to contract with ICE to hold immigrants at correctional facilities. The most significant example of that cooperation is the Orange County Correctional Facility, which as of last month held more than 80 immigrants detained by ICE . Only the federal ICE detention facility in Batavia holds more detained immigrants in New York. Clinton County Jail also works with ICE to serve as an immigrant detention center. Three counties – Nassau, Rensselaer and Broome – have signed agreements with ICE that permit their local jails to hold immigrants in order for them to be picked up by federal officials. While the Dignity Not Detention Act would not prevent immigration-related arrests in New York, supporters say it’s important for the state to minimize its cooperation with ICE. “We are living in a very scary and difficult time,” said Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who sponsors the bill. “This piece of legislation was meant to really carve us a line in the sand about what our New York values are.” Gov. Kathy Hochul has cranked up her rhetorical defenses of immigrants in New York following statements from last year that drew criticism from advocates. On Tuesday, she blasted the Trump administration after ICE detained a woman and her three school-age children while officials served a warrant for a different individual upstate. “I cannot think of any public safety justification for ICE agents to rip an innocent family, including a child in the third grade, from their Sackets Harbor home,” Hochul said in a statement. “That is not the immigration enforcement promised to the American people. It's just plain cruel.” She demanded the immediate return of the family. However, the governor has not signaled support for any number of bills that immigration advocates are pushing in the state Legislature. After activists praised Hochul for what they perceived as backing the New York for All Act – which would codify and expand sanctuary protections statewide – her office denied that she has taken any position on the bill. Her executive budget proposal included $44 million for immigrant legal services, far less than the $165 million that advocates want. As for the Dignity Not Detention Act, a spokesperson for Hochul said she would review the legislation if lawmakers approve it. Neither legislative chamber has advanced major immigration-related legislation yet this year, including the Dignity Not Detention Act. Lawmakers passed the Protect Our Courts Act in 2019 during the first Trump administration, which prohibits ICE agents from making arrests in and around courthouses barring a warrant signed by a judge. But in spite of the hopes of some legislators that New York would take swift action to pass additional protections to combat mass deportation efforts, the Legislature has not passed any of the major bills that advocates want. In the meantime, the ICE presence in New York has increased, with two new counties signing cooperation agreements and border czar Tom Homan promising to flood the state with immigration agents if state officials don’t cooperate with the federal government. The U.S. Department of Justice is also suing New York over a 2019 law that permits undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses but limits federal access to Department of Motor Vehicle data. “I have to be honest that I'm very disappointed in the way that New York state legislators have been ignoring this issue on immigration,” said Tania Mattos, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group UnLocal.

Lewis | April 2, 2025 By     Immigration Immigration Immigration Immigration Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Criminal Justice Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Albany Agenda Policy Policy Policy Policy New York State New York State New York State New York State In the wake of the high-profile detention of a mother and her three children upstate by federal immigration agents, immigrant advocates are once again demanding that state lawmakers pass legislation banning jails and prisons in New York from contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It’s one of several measures that activists are pushing for, as New York officials have largely taken a hands-off approach to strengthening immigrant protections since President Donald Trump started his mass deportation efforts. The Dignity Not Detention Act would make it illegal for local governments to contract with ICE to hold immigrants at correctional facilities. The most significant example of that cooperation is the Orange County Correctional Facility, which as of last month held more than 80 immigrants detained by ICE . Only the federal ICE detention facility in Batavia holds more detained immigrants in New York. Clinton County Jail also works with ICE to serve as an immigrant detention center. Three counties – Nassau, Rensselaer and Broome – have signed agreements with ICE that permit their local jails to hold immigrants in order for them to be picked up by federal officials. While the Dignity Not Detention Act would not prevent immigration-related arrests in New York, supporters say it’s important for the state to minimize its cooperation with ICE. “We are living in a very scary and difficult time,” said Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who sponsors the bill. “This piece of legislation was meant to really carve us a line in the sand about what our New York values are.” Gov. Kathy Hochul has cranked up her rhetorical defenses of immigrants in New York following statements from last year that drew criticism from advocates. On Tuesday, she blasted the Trump administration after ICE detained a woman and her three school-age children while officials served a warrant for a different individual upstate. “I cannot think of any public safety justification for ICE agents to rip an innocent family, including a child in the third grade, from their Sackets Harbor home,” Hochul said in a statement. “That is not the immigration enforcement promised to the American people. It's just plain cruel.” She demanded the immediate return of the family. However, the governor has not signaled support for any number of bills that immigration advocates are pushing in the state Legislature. After activists praised Hochul for what they perceived as backing the New York for All Act – which would codify and expand sanctuary protections statewide – her office denied that she has taken any position on the bill. Her executive budget proposal included $44 million for immigrant legal services, far less than the $165 million that advocates want. As for the Dignity Not Detention Act, a spokesperson for Hochul said she would review the legislation if lawmakers approve it. Neither legislative chamber has advanced major immigration-related legislation yet this year, including the Dignity Not Detention Act. Lawmakers passed the Protect Our Courts Act in 2019 during the first Trump administration, which prohibits ICE agents from making arrests in and around courthouses barring a warrant signed by a judge. But in spite of the hopes of some legislators that New York would take swift action to pass additional protections to combat mass deportation efforts, the Legislature has not passed any of the major bills that advocates want. In the meantime, the ICE presence in New York has increased, with two new counties signing cooperation agreements and border czar Tom Homan promising to flood the state with immigration agents if state officials don’t cooperate with the federal government. The U.S. Department of Justice is also suing New York over a 2019 law that permits undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses but limits federal access to Department of Motor Vehicle data. “I have to be honest that I'm very disappointed in the way that New York state legislators have been ignoring this issue on immigration,” said Tania Mattos, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group UnLocal.

Kathy Hochul has said that she’s willing to hold up the state budget for as long as it takes to get legislative leaders to agree to her policy proposals – but most City & State readers expect the budget to be wrapped up in the next couple weeks. More than 380 people entered City & State’s 2025 state budget poll, with guesses ranging from April 10 at the earliest to Aug. 8 at the latest. The poll was first made available on April 9, and two sunny-eyed optimists predicted that the budget would be finished the very next day – only to soon be disappointed. The most popular guess was April 30 (with 31 guesses), closely followed by April 25 and April 29 (with 28 guesses each) and April 24 and May 2 (with 22 guesses each). Most readers expect that the budget will be finalized in the last week of April. In fact, more than a third of all guesses were for somewhere between April 24 and April 30. Bizarrely, though, only two people guessed that the budget would be finished specifically on April 27. If budget negotiations drag into May, as City & State has reported they might, readers expect them to be wrapped up relatively quickly in the month. Of the 133 people who guessed that the budget would be finished some time in May, 51 guessed it would be finished between May 1 and May 3. Fortunately, few people seem to think we’re headed back to the bad old days of the Pataki administration, when budgets weren’t finished until the late summer. Only 11 people guessed that the budget would be finalized in June, July or August.

Jefferson | April 1, 2025 By Austin C. Jefferson April 1, 2025 Albany Agenda Budget Policy New York State It may be April Fools Day, but the soon to be late state budget is no laughing matter in Albany. The state Legislature passed a $1.7 billion budget extender on Tuesday that will fund the state government through Thursday. State Budget Director Blake Washington acknowledged yesterday that despite negotiations over the weekend, the 2026 Fiscal Year budget would not be settled by its April 1 deadline, and more extenders have been prepared. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have said that policy disputes, rather than concerns about finances, are the main thing holding up the budget, though there are also questions about how to fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s capital plan. Changes to discovery laws, an expansion of the involuntary commitment standard, a mask ban and a ban on cell phones in schools are among Gov. Kathy Hochul’s non-negotiable policy priorities. “We'll take as long as it takes to deliver,” Washington told reporters Monday. He said that the extender was primarily to fund Medicaid cycle payments and continue to pay the state’s workforce. Lawmakers do not receive their salary when the budget runs past its deadline. State Senate Republicans are not pleased with how negotiations are proceeding. State Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt said that New Yorkers were seeing was a failure in leadership from Democrats in state government. “I’d rather have a good budget than an on time budget, that’s Rob Ortt,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But we’re going to have neither, we’re going to have a bad budget and it’s going to be late.” Last week, Stewart-Cousins and Heastie indicated that negotiations had made significant progress, but discovery reform was proving to be a sticking point – in particular because the governor’s team has not yet sent the specific language for its most recent proposal. Heastie said that Assembly members have made clear in conference that they have significant reservations about any rollbacks to legislation that would speed up trials. It’s not clear yet what stage budget negotiations are currently at, but lawmakers are prepared to go into next week. If a budget agreement isn’t reached by Thursday, another extender would be passed to fund the government through Monday, and the cycle would repeat itself until lawmakers and Hochul finally find common ground. This will be the governor’s fourth straight late budget; last year’s budget didn’t pass until April 20.

The coalition includes building service workers union 32BJ SEIU, public employees union District Council 37, the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, the New York State Nurses Association and the Communications Workers of America District 1. The group is backing Assembly Member Harvey Epstein in the crowded race to represent lower Manhattan’s District 2. They’re unsurprisingly backing former 32BJ staffer Shirley Aldobol in the Democratic primary in Bronx District 13, which is currently represented by Republican City Council Member Kristy Marmorato. Aldobol already had the backing of 32BJ as well as the Bronx County Democratic Party. Labor Strong is also aligned with Bronx County in District 17, where it’s backing state Sen. Nathalia Fernandez’s staffer Justin Sanchez in the race to succeed City Council Land Use Chair Rafael Salamanca Jr. Speaker Adrienne Adams’ staffer Ty Hankerson got the coalition’s nod in the race to succeed her in Queens Council District 28. In Brooklyn’s District 47, it’s backing Justin Brannan staffer Kayla Santosuosso. The coalition has now endorsed in 27 City Council races. It has not yet endorsed against any Democratic incumbents, and has so far stayed out of a few contentious races. It hasn't weighed in on the high-dollar race to succeed Council Member Keith Powers in District 4 on the Upper East Side, for example, or the similarly high-profile races to succeed Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala or Queens Council Member Francisco Moya. It also hasn't weighed in on serious challenges to incumbents Chris Marte, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Kevin Riley or Darlene Mealy. A spokesperson for the group said “it’s possible” more endorsements could follow. In previous cycles, the Labor Strong independent expenditure committee has spent more than a million dollars supporting chosen candidates. It has not launched its committee yet for 2025, but plans to start spending closer to the primary date. Several of the unions in the coalition will play a role in selecting the next New York City Council speaker . “Our five unions are proud to stand together in our efforts to elect City Council candidates who truly support workers, unions, and the needs of our city’s working families,” the group said in a statement. “These candidates have earned our endorsement by demonstrating that they will support our unions and members, as well as fight to make New York City more affordable and livable for all. We look forward to using our collective power and resources to see each of them elected to the City Council.” The coalition is so far split on the New York City mayoral race. HTC and 32BJ SEIU have endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, while DC 37 endorsed Speaker Adams. CWA District 1 and NYSNA haven’t endorsed anyone yet. Here’s the full list of candidates the coalition is endorsing. Candidates in bold were most recently announced. An asterisk indicates an incumbent.

Lewis | April 24, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 Budget Housing Homelessness Policy Albany Agenda New York State State leaders are negotiating a potential deal to include a long-desired rental voucher bill in the state budget, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions. It’s the most serious that discussions about the measure have gotten since legislators and housing advocates started pushing for it in earnest several years ago. Talk of the Housing Access Voucher Program emerged as the state budget nears the one month mark in tardiness. Although the measure has widespread support from tenant advocates and real estate interests alike, Gov. Kathy Hochul has repeatedly declined to back the measure in the past over the price tag. Advocates have called for a minimum of $250 million to fund the program that would provide rental vouchers to people at imminent risk of eviction and those currently experiencing homelessness. They estimate the total cost of the program to hit about $1 billion, while the governor’s office has asserted it would cost the state as much as $6 billion to implement. Both the state Senate and Assembly have included the voucher program and $250 million of funding in their one-house budget proposals for several years. Without support from the governor, though, the measure has fallen off the table time and again. Now, multiple sources with knowledge of negotiations say that Hochul has expressed a new openness to discussing the program and the potential for finding a compromise to include it in the late spending plan. One source suggested that while the governor’s office may not be offering a “warm” reception, the fact that they opened the door at all is a big step forward compared to years past. Although legislative leaders are discussing the prospect of a deal, details on what exactly that would look like remain murky. The biggest question that remains unanswered is exactly how much money the state would dedicate to the program in the case of a compromise. None of the sources briefed on discussions could even provide a ballpark estimate of what the governor may counter with, if not the full $250 million that advocates and lawmakers have pushed for. The Housing Access Voucher Program has continued to rack up support from a variety of interests, even those that often find themselves on opposing sides on other housing matters. Both Housing Committee chairs in the Legislature recently published a joint op-ed with Real Estate Board of New York President James Whelan and WIN CEO Christine Quinn in support of the measure. Several high profile unions – including 32BJ, the United Federation of Teachers and DC37 – also sent a new letter to Hochul on Thursday offering their support for the program as well, marking the first time that labor has offered public, unified advocacy for the bill. – With reporting by Austin C.

Several high profile unions – including 32BJ, the United Federation of Teachers and DC37 – also sent a new letter to Hochul on Thursday offering their support for the program as well, marking the first time that labor has offered public, unified advocacy for the bill. – With reporting by Austin C.

HONORS: Awards lists include the 40 Under 40: Rising Stars, 50 Over 50: The Age Disruptors and the new 40 In Their 40s, as well as the exclusive Responsible 100 list that closes out the year. Additionally, the prestigious Above & Beyond awards this year will profile outstanding women, leaders in social services and minority and female entrepreneurs. POWER LISTS: In addition to the premier New York City Power 100 and Albany Power 100, City & State’s ranked power lists cover geographic areas as well as various professions, industries and sectors. The ranked Power of Diversity series spotlights exceptional women and Latinos in 2025, and Asian and Black Americans the following year. TRAILBLAZERS: The Trailblazers lists cover many of the same categories and themes as the Power 100s, typically alternating every other year with a Power 100 of the same topic. These unranked lists provide more space for honorees who have not been on a Power 100, including deputy-level officials and others who lead up-and-coming organizations that merit recognition. WHO’S WHO: The Who’s Who series introduces the New Yorkers you need to know within specific job types and sectors.

Lewis | April 15, 2025 By Rebecca C. Lewis April 15, 2025 Budget Criminal Justice Albany Agenda Policy New York State Discovery Reform The state budget, now over two weeks late, may be slightly closer to completion now that Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has announced a “framework” of a deal on the issue of discovery. “I just briefed my conference, and we’re in a good place,” Heastie told reporters on Tuesday, additionally thanking New York City’s five district attorneys, whom he had been discussing the matter with. The non-fiscal issue has been a major priority for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has said she would not sign a budget without changes to the law that governs evidence-sharing and has been holding up the budget until coming to an agreement. Details of the conceptual deal, which still needs a thumbs-up from the governor, remain murky. But Heastie said the compromise would allow judges to consider prejudice when it comes to missing evidence – a matter that had emerged as a key sticking point between prosecutors and public defenders. District attorneys around the state, who have played an outsized role in the negotiations, have made it clear that they won’t budge unless judges can consider whether a missing piece of evidence would unfairly prejudice the defense before deciding whether to dismiss a case. Criminal justice reform advocates, meanwhile, have viewed that question of prejudice as a hard line in the sand. Hochul was in Manhattan on Monday, once again making the case for her proposed changes to the discovery law, which would roll back parts of the 2019 reforms that were meant to even the playing field between prosecutors and defendants. She has been insistent that the changes are necessary to prevent the dismissal of cases on mere “technicalities,” which she says is unfair to survivors of domestic violence. “Three months ago, I stood up before our state, and I made a vow, and that was to fight for victims of domestic and gender-based violence,” Hochul said, referencing the introduction of her executive budget proposal in January. “A vow to fix loopholes that denies them justice and very often puts their lives in danger.” Hochul has had district attorneys advocating for the changes as surrogates several times in the past week, and she herself has now held three different press conferences to push for the changes. At Monday’s event in Manhattan, she hammered home statistics that show that 94% of domestic violence cases were dismissed in 2023 in New York City. According to her office, that’s up from 70% of cases in 2019 before the reforms took effect. The governor’s proposed changes to discovery, meant to narrow the pool of evidence prosecutors must turn over to the defense and to make it harder for judges to dismiss cases over discovery mistakes, have rankled public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates. The defenders have argued that the governor’s “tweaks,” which are strongly supported by the state’s district attorneys, would effectively amount to a wholesale repeal of the 2019 reforms and once again allow prosecutors to withhold crucial evidence until the eve of a trial. The debate over the discovery law is highly technical and hinges heavily on the specific language used in the law. The governor released proposed language in her executive budget proposal back in January, and state Sen. Cordell Cleare released her own alternative proposal earlier this month. One of the key issues in dispute is the matter of prejudice, or the degree to which a piece of evidence directly impacts the defendant’s case. The Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, ruled in the case People v. Bay that a judge must consider a prosecutor’s good faith and due diligence when making a decision about missing evidence. If a court finds that evidence was not turned over before the speedy trial deadline elapsed, but that the prosecutor exercised good faith and due diligence in seeking to turn over evidence, then they cannot dismiss the case. But in cases where the court finds that prosecutors did not exercise due diligence and a missing piece of evidence was only found after the speedy trial clock has run out, then they must dismiss the case. “There is no rule of ‘strict liability’; that is, the statute does not require or anticipate a ‘perfect prosecutor,’” Judge Caitlin Halligan wrote in the Bay decision. “On the other hand, the plain terms of the statute make clear that while good faith is required, it is not sufficient standing alone and cannot cure a lack of diligence.” The decision goes on to cite the factors that judges should consider when assessing whether or not prosecutors demonstrated due diligence. “Although the relevant factors for assessing due diligence may vary from case to case, courts should generally consider, among other things, the efforts made by the prosecution and the prosecutor's office to comply with the statutory requirements, the volume of discovery provided and outstanding, the complexity of the case, how obvious any missing material would likely have been to a prosecutor exercising due diligence, the explanation for any discovery lapse, and the People's response when apprised of any missing discovery,” Halligan wrote. Prosecutors argue that it is not enough for judges to consider only good faith and due diligence. They also want judges to consider prejudice. They argue that even if a prosecutor mistakenly does not act with due diligence in looking for evidence and turning it over to the defense, a case still shouldn’t be dismissed if the missing evidence is trivial. “The point really is that nothing should be dismissed if it was inadvertent, if there's no prejudice to the defendant and whether or not it's looked at as a whole to be fair,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in Albany last week. “And that's really the language that the governor is proposing, which is that the judges look at the entire discovery as a whole, not just one document.” Several legislators, as well as criminal justice reform advocates, have supported codification of the Bay decision. But district attorneys say that would not be sufficient. “It doesn’t factor in prejudice,” Westchester District Attorney Susan Cacace said of the Bay decision. “If something that's not turned over to by happenstance, despite the people's due diligence, is not relevant to the case, there shouldn't be a dismissal, unless prejudice,” Cacace said. However, under current law and the Bay decision, Cacace’s hypothetical would not lead to dismissal if prosecutors show they exercised due diligence. It’s a big reason why criminal justice reform advocates support the Bay standard. Eli Northrup, a public defender and policy advocate at the Bronx Defenders, called it “pretty damning” if prosecutors are saying that due diligence is too high a standard to hold them to. According to public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates, permitting the consideration of prejudice would remove the incentive for district attorneys to hand over evidence in a timely manner. “During the ‘blindfold era,’ the court was unable to enforce prompt discovery disclosure because it could not impose a consequence unless the defense demonstrated that late disclosure caused prejudice that couldn’t be cured with more time to review the material,” a fact sheet from the group Protect Kalief’s Law reads. In other words, the advocates argue that if prejudice is explicitly considered again without any other guardrails, the risk of dismissal would all but disappear in favor of delays to the trial, often to the detriment of the accused. It sounded like there might be room for compromise, even on the issue of prejudice. But as of Tuesday afternoon, the specifics on what legislators may be agreeing to remain murky – particularly whether or not prejudicial evidence would lead to automatic dismissal after the speedy trial clock runs out or whether a judge could impose other cures like delays instead of dismissal. And the difference between the two is a major one for defense attorneys and prosecutors alike. – With reporting from Austin C.

Lewis | April 24, 2025 05:27 PM ET By Rebecca C. Lewis April 24, 2025 05:27 PM ET Immigration Nonprofits News & Politics Donald Trump New York City Republicans in Congress are starting to come after nonprofits in New York who sponsor “Know Your Rights” training for immigrants as the federal government continues to deport large numbers of immigrants. The House Committee on Homeland Security last week launched a probe into the Chinese-American Planning Council, also known as CPC, over the social services nonprofit’s role in a March 8 Know Your Rights training in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Republican Rep. Mark Greene, the chair of the committee, sent a letter to CPC President and CEO Wayne Ho alerting him of the committee’s investigation into “the potential use of federal funds by non-government organizations (NGOs) to facilitate illegal immigration.” Greene requested that Ho send a slew of documents to facilitate that investigation, including any materials used for the preparation of the March 8 training seminar or any other similar trainings since November of last year, copies of federal grant applications from 2021 on, and information on how CPC has spent federal funding. The letter offers an April 30 deadline to provide the requested documents. According to the letter, the CPC has received more than $900,000 in funding from the federal government since 2022. The investigation into the nonprofit could put future funding and grant applications in jeopardy, depending on its outcome. The CPC caught the attention of congressional Republicans thanks to an “undercover” video released by the Oversight Project , a right-wing government accountability group that is part of the Heritage Foundation. Citing footage taken by the rightwing news outfit Muckraker of the Know Your Rights training in March, the Oversight Project described the seminar as a “radical activist meeting” where “antideportation leftists coordinate efforts to stop ICE and law enforcement from enforcing the nation’s immigration laws” and called the CPC a “radical New York-based NGO” that “should have no place receiving taxpayer dollars as they engage in anti-law, pro-illegal immigration activism.” Know Your Rights trainings have become increasingly common in New York and around the country since President Donald Trump’s election and his promise of mass deportations. Many Democratic lawmakers have hosted or sponsored such seminars, in which organizers teach immigrants about the legal rights they can exercise when interacting with immigration agents. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in particular, has come under fire for hosting a training in which she advised immigrants that they don’t need to open their doors for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents – which is both true and legal if the agents don’t have a warrant signed by a judge. But conservatives have called for an investigation into the seminar and have accused Ocasio-Cortez of illegally aiding undocumented immigrants. The news of the House committee’s letter to the CPC was first reported by the right-wing news website The Daily Caller, but the outlet did not indicate that it reached out to the nonprofit for comment. In his first public comment since receiving the letter, Ho defended his organization and the training it sponsored. “Our trainings help community members better understand their rights on a range of services, including education, healthcare, employment, housing, immigration, and more,” Ho said in a statement to City & State. “CPC fully adheres to all laws. Our trainings do not direct anyone to do anything or to evade the law, but rather to inform participants of their constitutional rights which they may choose to exercise.” He added that the nonprofit remains “committed to transparency and constructive dialogue with decision makers.” Assembly Member Grace Lee, who co-sponsored the March training and represents part of Chinatown, slammed the investigation into the CPC. “The Trump administration’s sham investigation into CPC is a fascist move to undermine an organization providing critical services to the Asian American community,” Lee told City & State. “The Trump administration continues to drive policies that dismantle support systems our communities rely on and make the Asian American community suffer." The video from the Oversight Project that prompted the congressional action also heavily featured Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents Lower Manhattan, was featured on promotional material for the training and has requested federal funding for the organization. A spokesperson for Goldman did not directly address the targeting of the CPC, but defended the type of training it participated in. “This Administration is sending undercover ICE officers wearing masks to arrest people, ‘mistakenly’ flying legal residents to super max prisons in foreign countries, and wrongly detaining American citizens,” Goldman spokesperson Madison Andrus said in a statement to City & State. “The Congressman would happily offer anyone in this Administration a similar tutorial on due process rights and the rule of law so that they can stop breaking the law and recklessly terrorizing legal residents in this country.” A spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul, whom the video also featured, similarly did not directly address the apparent targeting of a prominent nonprofit in New York over immigration rights. But the spokesperson, Avi Small, offered support for efforts to educate people on their rights. “Governor Hochul has repeatedly said New York can help federal immigration officials arrest violent criminals, but will never support policies that rip families apart or target innocent children,” Small said. “Due process is the foundation of the American legal system, and Governor Hochul believes every single person deserves to know the rights they are granted under the United States Constitution.” Share This: NEXT STORY: DC 37, Tish James rebuke Cuomo in backing Adrienne Adams for mayor Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Immigration House GOP targets NY nonprofit over Know Your Rights training Republicans in Congress are investigating the Chinese-American Planning Council for sponsoring a seminar to educate immigrants about their rights when dealing with ICE.

Gibson at the 2024 Puerto Rican Heritage Month celebration. Photo courtesy of the Bronx Borough President’s Office The race for Bronx Borough President Outgoing City Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr., who will complete the maximum two terms representing the South Bronx’s District 17 at the end of 2025, is challenging incumbent Vanessa Gibson for the borough presidency this year. Gibson, who was elected in 2021, made history as the first woman and first Black Borough President elected in the Bronx. Unlike City Council membership, the borough presidency plays an advisory role without binding votes and has no ability to bring new legislation. Even so, the BP has significant sway in representing the interests of the borough, and Salamanca Jr. will have an advantage as a known candidate. “It’s obvious we need some type of change. We need help,” Salamanca told the Bronx Times upon announcing his candidacy in September. Close Get the Full Story News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up This race will be one to watch as Salamanca Jr., a native of the Longwood neighborhood, seeks to bring a more centrist stance to local politics, with housing a top priority, in keeping with given his current role as chair of the council’s Land Use Committee. Salamanca Jr. told the Bronx Times that his first move if elected borough president would be to declare a state of emergency for housing and advocate for the borough to stop “overspending” on shelters. Under his watch, District 17 has built the most affordable housing units of any district in the city, and if elected borough president, he vowed to fight for more equitable distribution of affordable housing throughout the borough and city. Campaign finance records show that Salamanca Jr. has raised $99,460 in contributions from 199 donors as of Dec. 24, including the Hunts Point Produce Market PAC ($1,000), Bronx Chamber of Commerce President Lisa Sorin ($75) and Arline Parks, vice chair and CEO of Diego Beekman, a nonprofit affordable housing complex in Mott Haven ($175). Bronx Mayoral candidates Well over a dozen candidates plan to challenge Mayor Eric Adams, including two Bronxites from different ends of the political spectrum. Michael Blake, who represented District 79 in the State Assembly from 2015 to 2021 and unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Ritchie Torres in the 2019 primary, announced his candidacy in November. “I am running for mayor with a bold Our City, Our Home, Our Dreams policy platform, which advances universal childcare, faster payments to nonprofits, tax incentives for college graduates and businesses to return to the city, and a balanced approach to public safety, public housing and public schools in our neighborhoods,” Blake said in a statement. He has been sharply critical of Adams, referring to him in a post on X as a “Black MAGA [Make America Great Again] mayor” after Adams offered congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump in November. Politico reports that in addition to the mayoral run, Blake is also considering a bid for chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, where he previously served as vice chair. Another Bronx mayoral candidate comes from the tiny-but-growing Bronx Conservative Party. Gonzalo Duran, a U.S. Marines veteran and native of the Belmont neighborhood, is the local party’s vice chair and mounted an unsuccessful challenge to Rep. Ritchie Torres for the District 15 House seat in the November election. Duran and the Conservative Party — which is distinct from the Republican Party — aim to put up candidates for all major city races to prevent Democratic incumbents from sliding through unopposed. Duran recently hosted a meeting of Conservative Party candidates in the Bronx, which largely focused on parental control over public education, reducing resources to immigrants and other common conservative stances. Duran’s mayoral platform focuses on increasing NYPD foot patrol in high-crime areas, increasing civic engagement in Bronx communities and lobbying against the development of high-rent housing, among other issues. Bronx Comptroller candidate Ismael Malave Jr. from Throggs Neck is one of seven candidates for NYC Comptroller seeking to succeed Brad Lander, who is running for mayor. The comptroller watches out for the city’s fiscal and budgetary health and identifies fraud and waste in government spending. Malave Jr., who was born in Puerto Rico, attended Baruch College and earned an MBA from Lehman College. He is running on a platform of fiscal responsibility, transparency and equity, as well as increased voter engagement. City Council races to watch District 8, representing the South Bronx and East Harlem Three candidates have joined the race to replace Council Member Diana Ayala, who will be term-limited out of the council seat she has held since 2018. Clarisa Alayeto , who chairs Bronx Community Board 1, recently announced her candidacy in her first-ever bid for citywide office. Alayeto has family roots in both East Harlem and the South Bronx and seeks to expand upon her Community Board connections to prioritize sanitation, public health and civic engagement in the area. Campaign finance records show several other candidates for the District 8 seat: Assembly Member Edward Gibbs, Daniel Aulbach-Sidibe, Federico Colon, Hector Feliciano, Wilfredo Lopez, Nicholas Reyes and Ayala’s current chief of staff, Elsie Encarnacion. District 14, representing Kingsbridge, Fordham and University Heights Bryan Hodge Vasquez , a Bronx native who comes from a law and policy background, announced in July his challenge to Pierina Sanchez for the District 14 council seat. He served as campaign manager for Leonardo Coello’s unsuccessful bid for the 77th Assembly District seat, an experience which helped him grow a base of grassroots support to get his own candidacy off the ground. Hodge Vasquez recently announced that his campaign is now eligible to receive matching funds, making him the youngest candidate to receive the eight-to-one small donation match from the city. “I am honored and humbled to know that our message—prioritizing truly affordable housing, lowering crime, and cutting grocery prices—is resonating with so many,” he said in a statement. District 17, representing the South Bronx, West Farms and Soundview-Bruckner-Bronx River Among the candidates to fill Salamanca Jr.’s council seat is Freddy Perez Jr., a local business owner, Community Board 1 member and Male Democratic District 84 Leader. His campaign will focus on affordable housing, safety, expansion of afterschool and early childhood programs and overall economic growth and affordability. Also in the race is Antirson Ortiz, who served as Bronx liaison under Comptroller Scott Stringer, a youth counselor and an office manager for the NY State Assembly. Other candidates for the seat include Justin Sanchez , chief of staff to State Senator Nathalia Fernandez; Elvis Santana, who ran unsuccessfully for the same seat in 2017 and for the Assembly District 79 seat in 2020; and Jasmine Uribe, director of operations for The Bronx Collab co-working space and founder of design studio Collab NYC. District 11, including Van Cortlandt Village, Kingsbridge and Riverdale Incumbent Eric Dinowitz will face a challenge from Danielle Herbert-Guggenheim , who has served as a middle school principal and vice chair of the Unity Democratic Club based in Riverdale. In a statement on her website, she said, “ Ask yourself, what real improvements in our daily lives have we seen in District 11 in the last four years? Not enough. Not fast enough.” District 13, including Throggs Neck and Pelham Bay Park Incumbent Kristy Marmorato made history in 2023 as the first female Republican elected in the Bronx and will be running for reelection next year. Other candidates include Shirley Aldobol, Executive Vice President at SEIU Local 32BJ overseeing New York metro public schools; David A. Diaz , a longtime City Islander who works at a Manhattan investment firm; and Theona Reets-DuPont, current chief of staff for Council Member Oswald Feliz, according to her LinkedIn profile. District 16, including Yankee Stadium, Highbridge and Morrisania Althea Stevens, chair of the Committee on Children and Youth, is currently listed as Undetermined for District 16. Shakur Joseph is a candidate for the seat and has overcome family incarceration, his own arrest at age 12 for taking a school laptop home and moving away from his family at age 16. He advocates for increased renter protections, increased food access and justice reform, including a reentry center for people returning from incarceration. Running for reelection These City Council candidates are running for reelection with no other candidates listed as of Dec. 24: Amanda Farías of District 18, who made history as City Council’s first Latina Majority Leader and represents the Parkchester and Soundview areas Oswald Feliz of District 15, which includes Belmont, Fordham and East Tremont and chairs the Committee on Small Business Kevin Riley of District 12, which includes Co-op City, Williamsbridge and Wakefield. Riley co-chairs the council’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus This story was updated Dec. 27 at 9:45 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. to add mention comptroller candidate Malave Jr. and council candidate Ortiz.

Michael Blake, who represented District 79 in the State Assembly from 2015 to 2021 and unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Ritchie Torres in the 2019 primary, announced his candidacy in November. “I am running for mayor with a bold Our City, Our Home, Our Dreams policy platform, which advances universal childcare, faster payments to nonprofits, tax incentives for college graduates and businesses to return to the city, and a balanced approach to public safety, public housing and public schools in our neighborhoods,” Blake said in a statement. “I am running for mayor with a bold Our City, Our Home, Our Dreams policy platform, which advances universal childcare, faster payments to nonprofits, tax incentives for college graduates and businesses to return to the city, and a balanced approach to public safety, public housing and public schools in our neighborhoods,” Blake said in a statement.
