Public service is my core value. I have worked on promoting a stronger democracy at non-profits, international development organizations, and universities.  My book “ Inside Congressional Committees ", which was published last year, explores our legislative system and how to make it more representative and functional. I hold a PhD in political science and have taught undergraduate and graduate political science courses. I teach students that they should think critically about our political system and be an active part of shaping it. I am currently a Senior Research Fellow and Manager at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. I work on combatting political violence, creating policy solutions that keep big money out of our politics, and making Congress and local governments work effectively. My work and commentary has appeared in the Washington Post, NPR, BBC, MSNBC, Scientific American, Newsweek, CSPAN, The Hill, Slate, The New York Times, Bloomberg, and other outlets. In Brooklyn, I’ve dedicated myself to local activism. I spend weekends campaigning for Democratic candidates at our farmers markets and subway stations and knocking on doors. I love being an active member of local political clubs, the food coop, and other groups that bring together the community in this wonderful district. I believe that community starts with family, those we are born into and those we create. In October 2024, I became a mom to our beautiful baby boy Liam. My spouse and I love being parents and connecting with other parents and families in the district.

As a Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, Maya is a leader in making legislative bodies more efficient and effective, combatting the rise of political violence, and fighting the spread of misinformation. As District 39’s Council Member, she will be a true partner to the many diverse groups in our community and work tirelessly to provide fast and effective constituent services.” Doug Schneider Democratic District Leader (AD-44) “I'm proud to endorse Maya Kornberg for City Council in the 39th Council District because she is the leader our community needs—practical, thoughtful, and results-driven. Maya understands that leadership is about delivering real solutions, not engaging in ideological battles. She will prioritize constituent services, advocate for safer streets, and fight for quality education. Maya will stand up for the entire community. She is the common-sense leader we need and I urge you to join me in supporting her.” David Yassky “Now more than ever, I’m excited to endorse Maya Kornberg to be the next Council Member from District 39. With Trump back in the White House, we need a City Council partner with the knowledge, even temper, and experience to push back against extremism and ensure that our City remains a beacon of Democratic ideals and values. Maya is the results-driven progressive we want fighting for all of us, and she will lead the charge to deliver more funding for childcare and education, better and more accountable MTA service, and keeping our communities safe. I hope you will join me in supporting her.” Fmr. City Council Member (Park Slope, Boerum Hill) The New Majority NYC The New Majority NYC Solidarity PAC Solidarity PAC Paid for by Maya for Council

The most important job of a City Council Member is to engage with local constituents. I’ve spent my career working on creating more responsive governance, and I know the number one rule is that people want to be heard, and government works better when it listens. We need the basics - a continuously open district office and constituent requests that are answered in a timely manner, but that’s just the start. I know from my work that it is particularly important to proactively engage disengaged communities (many of whom face barriers to engagement.) I will host monthly town halls that meet people where they are (at senior centers, places of worship, gyms, parks, bars, libraries community centers) with virtual engagement options for those who cannot join in person (including people with mobility issues or care obligations) and opportunities to send feedback and ideas via phone or send a video recording with sign language. I also know from my work with legislators that many constituents may not know who to contact about an issue or where to find their council member: I will work with my staff to set up “constituent service” tables at parks and other public spaces so that people can resolve their issues. In a diverse district, we need culturally competent and varied engagement opportunities that are created together with those with different lived experiences. I speak four languages (English, Spanish, Hebrew, and Arabic) and have worked on getting information on government and voting out to non-English speaking communities.  I will prioritize creating non-English language opportunities for engagement and hiring staff with different language skills and lived experiences. Another step is to invest in youth engagement, something I’m very passionate about as a college professor. Let’s continue with youth councils, but also invest in more internship programs for high school and college aged young people, more civic education in coordination with the NYC civic engagement commission. Community boards are an amazing tool for engagement, but we have to make sure they are truly representative and accessible. When there is an opaque appointment process controlled by the Borough President, meetings are at night, and board members are not compensated in any way, we shouldn’t be surprised our community boards are not representative of our community. I’ve worked with other countries that have engagement platforms and we know that providing childcare and transportation subsidies, flexible meeting and engagement times, and a transparent appointment process are crucial to creating real engagement. We must bring that to our community boards. As a Council Member, engaging with the community will be my number one priority. I want to hear from you . HERE Reinvigorate Civic Engagment .

Trump took office and immediately took aim at our basic rights and values. I’ve spent my career protecting our democracy. As your Council Member, I’ll continue standing up to Trump and fighting to protect our democracy from City Hall. We must invest in our schools and healthcare system, build robust civic engagement to restore trust in government, organize for action, and protect our immigrant neighbors. We don’t have a minute to waste. It’s time to take the fight to Trump and here’s how we’re going to do it: Increase investment in our schools and protect students from Trump’s immigration policies Trump has threatened to dissolve the Department of Education and stop critical conversations about issues like race from taking place in classrooms. But Washington only provides between a tenth and quarter of funding for K-12 education. I know as an educator that civic education is the bedrock of democracy. We must invest in our schools, protect students from Trump’s immigration policies, and make sure classrooms remain a place for critical thought and culturally responsive pedagogy. Build safe and accessible NYC transportation infrastructure and protect congestion pricing Trump has directed agencies to roll back critical policies designed to limit CO2 emissions, and he revoked Biden’s plan to ensure half of all new vehicles are electric. As with education, a majority of transportation infrastructure does not come from the federal budget. We need to create a safe, accessible subway system; invest in bike lanes; and promote sustainable building. We must protect congestion pricing and double down on policies that support a growing population and plan for a warming climate. Increase investment in women's health and accessible healthcare for all Trump says repealing the Affordable Care Act is one of his key priorities, and he has threatened to further limit access to abortion by doing things like reinstating the 19th Century Comstock Act (which bans the mailing of abortion pills). I’ve been teaching about the Comstock Act for years now in my American political development course. The original act directly targeted immigrant communities, women, and other marginalized groups, and this reinstatement would do the same. We have to make sure that everyone has access to healthcare, which is a basic human right. And we have to invest in women’s health, reproductive health, and maternal health as we face an attack on women that disproportionately targets women of color. Build civic engagement to restore trust in government Trump is undermining trust in our democratic institutions. When the President claims that our election was rigged and breaks down basic checks and balances, he is endangering the one thing all democracies rely on: trust. Research tells us that Americans don’t think our institutions matter and don’t think politicians are listening to them. I know from my work promoting responsive lawmaking in states, in Congress, and in legislatures around the world that rebuilding trust in government is the most important way to protect our democracy. Programs like participatory budgeting, platforms that allow citizens to take an active part in legislation, inclusive town halls designed to meet everyone, and civic education programs are more important than ever. Learn from history to harness disappointment into action Trump is trying to seize more power for the presidency. I’ve studied Congress my entire career, and the era most similar to this one is the Watergate era. Like Trump, Nixon spied on citizens, used agencies to retaliate against political enemies, and lied to Congress. In the election after the Watergate scandal, over 90 new members of Congress were elected, and many of them ran to create change. In the 1970s, Congress passed campaign finance reform, solidified their “power of the purse”, limited presidential power in foreign wars, and made dramatic changes to legislative procedure. We must similarly use this moment of profound disappointment as a catalyst for making a more equitable and just city and country. Safeguard NYC's sanctuary status and protect our immigrant neighbors Trump is attacking the core of what makes NYC great. This is a city of immigrants. I’m the proud granddaughter of immigrants who came to NYC because they were fleeing discrimination. We need to expand legal services, rapid response, and language access for immigrant communities; expand Temporary Protected Status; and make sure that schools, hospitals, and other key community institutions are safe for all. Racism and xenophobia are not new in this country, and we can learn from how marginalized groups have rallied together in the past. We must get organized, get active, and band together to protect our immigrant neighbors. Join me in the fight . HERE Take the Fight to Trump . Take the Fight to Trump .

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process (Columbia University Press) The book is now available for purchase online and in stores. You can order your copy here: Amazon Barnes&Noble Columbia University Press Indiepubs It is widely believed that Congress has broken down. Media accounts present the storied legislature as thoroughly gridlocked, paralyzed by partisan rancor. Political scientists find that Congress is passing fewer laws and spending less time on legislative work. Which parts of a supposedly dysfunctional legislature continue to function? This book examines the legislative process beyond voting patterns, emphasizing the crucial role of congressional committee hearings. In committees, lawmakers hear from expert witnesses, legislators revise and discuss bills before bringing them to a vote, and the public has an opportunity to engage with Congress. The book scrutinizes the inner workings of committees—the different types of witnesses who testify, the varied hearings Congress holds, and the distinct effects that committee work has on Congresspeople. It deploys original mixed-methods datasets that span from insider interviews to sentiment analysis examining the language used in hearings. The book evaluates how committees operate and the conditions affecting their performance, finding that committee work can be more deliberative and productive than the politics of the Congress floor. Through a comprehensive exploration of who committees hear from and how they listen, this book demonstrates that Congress is not as dysfunctional as is often claimed. Inside Congressional Committees also suggests timely reforms based on these findings that can strengthen Congress. Reviews “Maya L. Kornberg has produced a rich, informative, and beautifully written study of the internal operations of the contemporary Congress. Inside Congressional Committees is a refreshingly balanced perspective, one that offers a nuanced understanding of Congress’s strengths, weaknesses, and complex institutional realities.” Frances E. Lee, Princeton University “This creative and impressive book shines a welcome light on the political underbelly of committees in the U.S. Congress. Marshalling a remarkable array of evidence, Kornberg pinpoints the roles of norms and relationships in sustaining committees as arenas of bipartisan problem solving. She advances a nuanced, clear-eyed view of the potential and pitfalls of today’s committees.” Sarah Binder, George Washington University “Kornberg significantly increases our understanding of how congressional committee hearings are structured, who testifies at them, what those witnesses say, and what impact the hearings have. This book is a must-read for scholars of Congress.” Josh Chafetz, Georgetown University “Everyone loves to hate Congress for being dysfunctional, polarized, and weak. Kornberg’s elegant study asks us to think twice. She carefully examines how congressional committees actually channel expertise and discourse, why that matters, and where to focus any efforts to make it better.” William J.
