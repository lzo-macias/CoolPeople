LINDA HARRISON REMEMBERS PLANET OF THE APES February 11, 2018 February 11, 2018 by Tom Lisanti In honor of the 50th Anniversary of the original Planet of the Apes , I am re-sharing a revised interview with the original Nova Linda Harrison that ran in Filmfax magazine. Linda Harrison will always be remembered as the beauty among the beasts. She left an indelible impression on 1960s moviegoers as the mute Nova, opposite Charlton Heston’s lost astronaut, Taylor, in the classic sci-fi films, Planet of the Apes (1968) and Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970). With her long, dark hair and big, brown eyes, Linda had the perfect qualities to bring Nova to life on the big screen. “Nova means new,” reminded Linda Harrison. “I felt very comfortable playing her. I didn’t even have to audition. Dick told me I had the look they wanted.” Dick was Richard Zanuck, then head of 20 th Century-Fox. It was on the studio lot that Linda met Zanuck, whom she married in 1969. Beauty pageants led to an introduction to a young agent named Mike Medavoy who helped Linda get signed by 20 th Century-Fox. The studio was restarting its acting school program for its contract players. At the time, the acting roster included Jacqueline Bisset, Tom Selleck, Christina Ferrare, Lara Lindsay, and Corinna Tsopei. After playing small roles in the unfunny Jerry Lewis comedy Way…Way Out (1966) and the better received comedy The Guide for the Married Man (1967) with Walter Matthau and Robert Morse, Zanuck then handed the brunette beauty the role she would become world famous for that of Nova in Planet of the Apes . Before she was given Nova, Linda was part of the make-up creations by John Chambers who would go on to win a special Academy Award for his ingenious work. “I was used as a model for the make-up. That is what contract players did back then. You were being paid a weekly salary so sometimes you had to do things like this. The studio heads wanted to see if the makeup was doable. At that point they hadn’t green lighted Planet of the Apes yet. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. You had to know how to control your body. The whole process took about three hours.” Lucky for Linda and Charlton Heston, they didn’t have to go through this process daily unlike co-stars Hunter and McDowall. Recalling the cast, Harrison remembered, “He [Heston] had a quiet quality about him. Charlton was gentle and was always looking after me. He taught me how to favor the camera. As an actor, I was someone he kind of took under his wing, which was good for the film. Sometimes, simple things like that transfer to the screen, and are very dramatic.” “Roddy and Kim were great people and fabulous troopers. I’m not just saying that; they were pros. They had a difficult time with all that makeup. And they had to report to the set at 3:00 am!” Director Franklin J. Schaffner (who would go on to win a Best Director Academy Award for Patton ) was chosen to direct and per Linda had his own vision for the movie. “He was a very interesting man—very quiet. I remember Dick and I would have dinner with the assistant director on the movie. He and Dick were best friends. He would tell us nobody knows what the next shot will be, because Schaffner keeps it in his back pocket. He would only tell his cameraman, Leon Shamroy. But that lent itself to this kind of picture. It gave the actors a very interesting edge, not knowing what to expect next. I think his directly style worked very effectively.” One of the film’s many standout scenes and one that remained vivid in Linda’s mind was when the audience first sees the marauding gorillas on horseback hunting the humans in the forest backed by Jerry Goldsmith’s haunting Oscar-nominated score. It was a very complicated action piece per Linda. “We had the humans running one way, some apes beating the bushes, and some others on horseback. I’m sure this scene was dangerous, but I wasn’t aware of it. I had total trust in the people in charge. This was shot in Malibu on the 20 th Century-Fox ranch. They also built Ape City there. I remember it was always extremely hot. Even though I was scantily clad, my costume was made from real bark, with a rubber backing. I still felt the heat.” After hurling through space for over 2,000 years, four astronauts land on a planet where humans are mute primitives, and apes are their masters. Of the space travelers, only Taylor (Charlton Heston) survives their first encounter with the apes, but he is shot in the throat by the marauding human hunting gorillas on horseback. He is taken to Ape City (along with other humans including an intense beauty he dubs “Nova”) where he tries to convince a sympathetic psychologist Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and her archeologist finance Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) of his intelligence. When he regains his speech, he proves his superiority, but is thwarted by Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) who has always been aware of man’s intellect as well as being the harbinger of death. The film climaxes in the Forbidden Zone with Taylor proving that apes evolved from humans only to have Zaius cover up the proof. Zaius allows Taylor to go off with Nova deeper into the Forbidden Zone only to discover the horrible truth: the planet of the apes is actually Earth, whose civilization was destroyed by mankind. Taylor is on his knees in the sand yelling, “You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you to hell! The camera peers up to reveal a wrecked Statute of Liberty in the film’s final shot.

Credit... Adrian Octavius Walker By Peter Libbey Oct. 10, 2018 New Jersey’s largest museum has a new leader. On Wednesday, the Newark Museum announced that Linda Harrison had been selected to succeed Steven Kern as director and chief executive officer. Ms. Harrison is coming from the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco, where she has served as the director and chief executive since 2013. She said in an interview on Tuesday that she is looking to bring the “spirit of joie de vivre” she feels at the Museum of the African Diaspora to the Newark Museum. By that, she explained, she means that she wants to promote “inclusivity and openness to new ideas, new thoughts.” She also mentioned that she is hoping to “reimagine some of the beautiful collections that the Newark Museum has” and “re-engage the Newark and the greater Newark and New York audiences.” The Newark Museum, which dates back to 1909, is notable for having both a significant art collection, especially in the area of Tibetan art, and a significant natural history collection. It is also home to the Alice and Leonard Dreyfuss Planetarium. Ms. Harrison joins the museum at a time when Newark is undergoing what some have called a revival. After struggling for decades with issues of poverty, violence and economic erosion, there are indications that a brighter future might await the city. “We see all around us how the neighborhood is changing quickly to accommodate its renewed development and growth,” Clifford Blanchard, the co-chairman of the museum’s board of trustees said in a statement. “With Linda at the helm, the Newark Museum will continue to grow in its role as both a cultural and community anchor.” The transformation that Newark is undergoing today, Ms. Harrison said, reminds her of the way the Yerba Buena arts district of San Francisco changed over the past two decades. Arts institutions, she added, can play an integral role in how a growing city develops itself: “To be able to energize and bring to a neighborhood a cultural center that is so diverse in its audience as well as in its artistic programming, I think that that is going to be of value.” Ms. Harris will begin her new position in January 2019.
