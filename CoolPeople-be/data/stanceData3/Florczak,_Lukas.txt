I don't have any illusions that in office I could solve all crime. But leaders in the community and elected officials are in a unique place to implement policies that might prevent certain crimes and promote public safety. Things like regulating batteries on E-bikes, enforcing bike lane infractions and issuing biking licenses, or promoting and improving systems that help police response times like the reporting phone line and app. Public Safety remains a crucial issue when it comes to New York City.

But whatever these improvements might be, are only effective if the community understands what is going on and why practices have been changed. This starts with transparency between the People and a police and sherif's department that works tirelessly to improve public safety.

Education Equity Education Equity Education Equity Education Equity Education Equity The concept of education equity across all of New York City is something for which we should strive to achieve. However recent implementation of policy in the attempt to reach this goal have been both poorly conceived and handled. Access to the best high school education shouldn't come at the cost of teen mental health or safety. It's on policy makers and school administrators to discern what makes a school more attractive and have better results than others. Of course this comes down to a host of reasons but the solution isn't to turn away the young New Yorkers that live down the street. It should be about putting work into having more schools be competitive. The concept of education equity across all of New York City is something for which we should strive to achieve.

I see a solution coming from several places: a comprehensive dialogue with teachers and teacher's unions regarding how to better implement funds and other resources including educators across the city, a more dynamic education department and one that can swiftly facilitate forward progress as positive change is recommended, and a clear goal from city and state government that the status quo is not good enough.

I believe in an education system free for the People. However, the quality of this education shouldn't depend on wealth, status, or geography. It should be the responsibility of government to raise the level of education at all schools; but this isn't accomplished by barring the attendance of teens who live in proximity to top-notch institutions.

Affordable Housing and Homelessness Affordable Housing and Homelessness Affordable Housing and Homelessness Affordable Housing and Homelessness Affordable Housing and Homelessness Access to more affordable housing is desperately needed for a city whose homeless population is on the rise and while the cost of living across the country is skyrocketing. As construction technology allows for more efficient building techniques, this should allow for a large amount of low cost units.

In addition to this, current laws in place providing affordable housing units like section 8 or Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, should be expanded and bolstered by additional policies like Universal Affordability Preference or by lifting the 12 FAR Cap.

I also see a need to include modern construction techniques into the practices of local construction companies. For instance, the use of construction printing (think industrial 3D printing) can save costs, time, and materials. Cities around the world have begun using designs which prioritize environmental responses which naturally regulate heating and cooling. We can be leading at the front of the field, experimenting in building practices, designs, and materials. We can be the example for the rest of the United States when it comes to what the future can look like, while also holding reverence for the iconic landmarks that make our city skyline truly special.

These policies along with many others are what the city needs to have a wider availability of housing. This will also help decrease the currently rising number of homeless, who are most commonly characterized as couch surfers and anyone living out of their car. In fact those that live on the street make up a lower percentage of the homeless population than those who may simply be "between residences" with no realistic options.
