Founded in 1953, Einstein is an independent degree-granting institution within the Montefiore Einstein Health System . Einstein hosts an M.D. , a Ph.D. , and Masters programs. Admission to Einstein's MD program is among the most competitive in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 1.87% in 2024. Einstein is also home to one of the original three Medical Scientist Training Programs inaugurated in 1964. The program has received continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Planning for the college was initiated by Yeshiva University President Samuel Belkin in 1945. Physicist Albert Einstein , who noted that the college would be "unique" as it would provide medical training to "students of all creeds and races", lent his name to the institution. Due to Yeshiva's financial difficulties, Einstein was transferred to Montefiore in 2015. Following a $1 billion donation to the school by Ruth Gottesman in 2024, Einstein became tuition-free for all MD students. Einstein includes several NIH-designated centers and has been the site of medicals feats such as the first coronary artery bypass surgery . Faculty members have included 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences , three National Medal of Science recipients, and neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks . Alumni have made significant scientific contributions and include seven members of the National Academy of Sciences, two Howard Hughes Medical Investigators , a MacArthur Fellow , and a National Medal of Science awardee. History [ edit ] [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] [ edit ]   In 1945, Yeshiva University President Samuel Belkin began planning a new medical school. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ note 1 ] Under his urging, Yeshiva's Board of Trustees negotiated with the New York State Board of Regents to expand the university's charter to grant M.D. degrees, finalized in December 1950. [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 1951, physicist Albert Einstein wrote a letter to Belkin lauding the planned school, writing that it was "of the greatest importance to American Jewry" and would "welcome students of all creeds and races". He became an honorary chairman for the medical school campaign, alongside former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt , New York Governor Thomas Dewey , and Richard Nixon . [ 2 ] [ ] The modest Einstein was initially reluctant to associate his name with the school—he had recently refused to lend his name to Brandeis University and had declined to become the second president of Israel —and instead suggested that it be named for the Jewish physician Maimonides . [ 2 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Two years later, at an event marking his 74th birthday, March 14, 1953, Einstein agreed to lend his name to the medical school. [ 2 ] [ 8 ] [ note 2 ] At the gathering—his only public appearance in 22 years at the Institute for Advanced Study —Einstein told The New York Times that "physics has favored medicine by giving civilized man confidence in the scientific method." [ 6 ] [ 9 ] Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, months prior to the institution's dedication and opening. [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Although affiliation with Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan was considered, a site in the Bronx 's Morris Park was selected due to ample land and proximity to the adjacent Bronx Municipal Hospital then under construction. [ 10 ] Construction of the first medical school building—now the Leo Forchheimer Medical Sciences Building—began in October 1953, with a contemporary design of steel and concrete. [ 11 ] [ 6 ] On September 12, 1955, Einstein welcomed its first class of 56 students in the partially completed Forchheimer Building. [ 3 ] [ 12 ] Einstein was the first new medical school to open in New York City since 1897 and the first in the United States to open under Jewish auspices. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Expansion [ edit ] [ edit ] The Sue Golding Graduate Division was established in 1957 to offer Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in biomedical science. In 1963, Einstein established its Department of Genetics, the first at any at any medical school; [ 15 ] the coursework it offered was possibly the first formal medical curriculum on genetics. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The following year, the Medical Scientist Training Program , a combined MD–PhD program, was established. [ 18 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The first successful coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in 1960 at Einstein by a team led by Robert H. Goetz ; [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the procedure has been described as "one of the most significant surgical achievements of the 20th century". [ 20 ] In 1966, the school opened a private teaching hospital for its students, now the Jack D. Weiler Hospital. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The Ullmann Research Center for Health Sciences, a 12-story facility, opened in 1964. [ 22 ] The following year, the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation donated $1.45 million to Einstein to establish a center to study human development and mental disabilities. [ 23 ] [ note 3 ] The center, named for Rose F. Kennedy , opened with 200 staff scientists in 1970. [ 3 ] [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Recent history [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1996, Einstein built a 10-story research complex, the Samuel H. and Rachel Golding Building. [ 3 ] Six years later, the college opened the three-story Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center. Equipped with magnetic resonance equipment beyond conventional MRI, the center was the only such facility in the New York metropolitan area and one of six in the world upon opening. [ 27 ] [ ] [ ] In 2008, Einstein opened a $225 million research complex, the Price Center. [ 28 ] This expansion doubled the size of Einstein's campus to nearly 40 acres. [ 29 ] Also that year, the college replaced its old logo—a "staid" portrait of Albert Einstein—with a stylized symbol that represents the helical structure of DNA , a notable spiral staircase on campus, and "E" for Einstein. [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2024, Ruth Gottesman —a long-time professor at the medical school and head of the board of trustees—donated $1 billion to the school to make tuition free for all students in perpetuity. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The contribution also stipulated that the college never change its name. The donation was one of the largest to any educational insitution, and, according to The New York Times , likely the largest donation to any medical school. [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affiliations and teaching hospitals [ edit ] [ edit ] Montefiore [ edit ] [ edit ]   Einstein's parent institute, Montefiore Health System, is a private healthcare system and one of the largest employers in New York. It comprises 15 member hospitals, including Montefiore Einstein Medical Center and Children's Hospital at Montefiore , and has the busiest emergency room in New York City and the ninth busiest in the United States. [ 32 ] The system was founded in 1884 and is named for Moses Montefiore , a British financier and the Sheriff of London . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Einstein first became affiliated with Montefiore in 1963, with Montefiore attending physicians serving as Einstein faculty. [ 12 ] By 1969, financial troubles led Yeshiva University to contract its Jack D. Weiler Hospital to the Montefiore Medical Center. [ 11 ] [ 35 ] In 1980, the college's Department of Medicine merged with Montefiore. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In the 2010s, Yeshiva University's mounting financial troubles—caused in part by Einstein's high operational costs and a $110 million loss to Bernie Madoff 's Ponzi scheme in 2008—led the university to transfer ownership of the medical school to Montefiore in 2015. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Although the deal's details were largely kept private, Einstein became a new entity with 51 percent ownership by Montefiore and 49 percent by Yeshiva. Montefiore assumed all operational and financial responsibilities. [ 36 ] Yeshiva continued to grant Einstein's degrees until 2019, when the medical school achieved independent degree-granting authority. [ 38 ] In 2021, Yeshiva and Montefiore launched a competitive joint B.A./B.S.-M.D. program for students entering Yeshiva. [ 39 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Jacobi [ edit ] [ edit ] In conjunction with the construction of Einstein's first building, New York City constructed a 1,349-bed, $37.5 million hospital adjacent to the school. [ 6 ] [ 12 ] Now the Jacobi Medical Center , Belkin and New York City Mayor Vincent Impellitteri agreed to permit its use as Einstein's teaching hospital . [ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 12 ] The hospital provides healthcare for some 1.2 million Bronx and New York City area residents. Jacobi is the primary clerkship site for 3rd- and 4th-year medical students from Einstein. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Student body and life [ edit ] [ edit ] As of 2025, Einstein had 789 medical students according to U.S. News & World Report . [ 1 ] Admission to Einstein's MD program is among the most competitive in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 1.87% in 2024. All students are awarded the full-tuition Gottesman Scholarship, with an average total cost of $138,000 for the four year program. New York residents comprise 44 percent of M.D. students. [ 40 ] [ ] [ ] Einstein offers housing for students and postdoctoral researchers. [ 41 ] Student housing consists of three 28-story towers built in 1970. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Apartments arrangementions include studios, 1 bedrooms, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms, and 3 bedroom penthouses. [ 43 ] The campus also hosts a reacreational facility, the Falk Center, that houses a gym, pool, and courts for basketball, racquetball, and squash. [ 43 ] An underground parking garage is also located on campus. [ 41 ] [ 43 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Academic programs [ edit ] [ edit ] MD program [ edit ] [ edit ] The first 16 months of the MD program, the preclerkship phase, consists of fundamental scientific and medical coursework. Longitudinal courses include bioethics and service learning. [ 44 ] This is followed by a 12 month clinical phase that includes clerkships and preparation for and completion of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 . Clerkships are followed by completion of the USMLE Step 2 exam . The final 18 months of medical school include clinical electives, increased clinical duties, and a research capstone project. [ 45 ] [ ] [ ] In addition to Jacobi and Montefiore hospitals, medical students can train in medical facilities such as the VA Bronx Healthcare System and Bronx Psychiatric Center . [ 46 ] Students may also volunteer at the Einstein Community Health Outreach (ECHO) Free Clinic, which provides care to those without health insurance. Founded in 1999, ECHO was the first such clinic in New York City and one of the first in the United States. [ 47 ] [ ] [ ] Medical Scientist Training Program [ edit ] [ edit ] Einstein hosts one of the three inaugural Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs) launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1964. [ 18 ] MSTPs are fully-funded dual doctoral MD-PhD programs, offering both graduate and clinical training for physician-scientists . [ 18 ] [ 48 ] The program includes waived tuition, a stipend, subsidized housing, and a sesquiennial retreat to the Edith Macy Conference Center . [ 49 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The first year of the program integrates medical school preclerkship curriculum with graduate school coursework and lab rotations . In the second year, students complete preclinical medical courses, take USMLE Step 1, and choose a PhD advisor based on lab rotations. Years three to five focus on PhD research, publication, and optional clinical activities, followed by intensive clinical clerkships in years six and seven after dissertation defense. [ 50 ] While working in the lab, MSTP students engage in both pathology case studies and clinics to maintain clinical skills. [ 49 ] [ ] [ ] PhD Program [ edit ] [ edit ] Applicants apply directly to the PhD program, not to a specific department. This allows graduate students to gain exposure many areas of research before making an informed decision about the thesis work. [ 51 ] There are more than 200 biomedical laboratories for students to choose. [ 52 ] [ ] [ ] The Ph.D. concentration in Clinical Investigation provides advanced training that prepares students for an independent research career in clinical and translational science. It is offered for Ph.D. students enrolled in Einstein’s graduate division and for M.D./Ph.D. students in Einstein’s Medical Scientist Training Program. [ 53 ] [ ] Master's degree programs  [ edit ] [ edit ] The Clinical Research Training Program, founded in 1998, awards of the Master of Science in Clinical Research Methods. This program involves spending one year after clerkships and some elective time during the fourth year completing courses in clinical research methods and driving a mentor-guided research project that leads to two first-author manuscripts. This program is offered at no additional cost to medical students and fellowship stipends are available. [ 54 ] In partnership with Yeshiva's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Einstein offers a Master of Science in Bioethics that focuses on transnational work in bioethics to help professionals improve care and communication. [ 55 ] [ ] [ ] Research [ edit ] [ edit ] Funding and research centers [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2024, Einstein received $192 million in funding from the NIH. [ 56 ] The college hosts several NIH-designated centers: [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center Center for AIDS Research Diabetes Research Center Harold and Muriel Block Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at Einstein and Montefiore Institute for Aging Research Marion Bessin Liver Research Center New York Regional Center for Diabetes Translation Research Rose F. Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center Notable research [ edit ] [ edit ] Einstein researchers have made significant discoveries and advancements. Thymosins were discovered in Abraham White 's lab at Einstein in 1966. [ 59 ] In 1968, after observing elevated hemoglobin A1c in a diabetes patient, Samuel Rahbar confirmed the discovery at Einstein with Helen Ranney and first structurally characterized A1c. [ 60 ] A1c tests are now the primary method of diabetes management. [ 61 ] In 1979, the mechanism of taxol —one of the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines —was identified by Susan Band Horwitz at Einstein. [ 62 ] Other notable research at Einstein includes the discovery of the Tc1/mariner transposon superfamily and the invention of single molecule mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] During the 1980s, Einstein researchers made significant discoveries on the emerging HIV/AIDS pandemic due to its high prevalence in the Bronx . [ 66 ] These include the first description of pediatric HIV/AIDS and crucial work on mother-to-child transmission , links with substance abuse and men who have sex with men , and the role of opportunistic infections like tuberculosis . [ 67 ] Mycobacterium —a bacterial genus that includes the species that cause tuberculosis and leprosy —was first genetically manipulated at Einstein by William Jacobs Jr. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] His large family of Mycobacterium strains (such as mc 2 155 ) are named for Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula: E = mc 2 . [ 68 ] With Paul Alan Cox , Einstein professor Oliver Sacks proposed that Lytico-bodig disease in the Chamorro people may be caused by consumption of flying foxes that had ingested cycad neurotoxins.

Key individuals were gastroenterologist Elihu Katz and biologist Shelley Saphine. As early as the 1930s, attorney Max Steuer had approached Yeshiva with plans to construct a new medical school, but nothing came of it due to Yeshiva's financial difficulties.

According to Yeshiva University, it may have been a reaction to antisemitic quotas in medical schools and a way to preserve his legacy amidst his declining health.

One of the tasks he undertook was to pass a law that would prohibit the use of dogs for the monotonous and hot task of turning grills in restaurants.
Later, when Bergh went to visit restaurants to monitor law enforcement, he discovered that numerous restaurants had replaced dogs with black children. [ 1 ] Therefore, Bergh also prompted the formation, in 1874, of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC). [ ] Life [ edit ] [ edit ] Henry Bergh was born August 29, 1813, in New York City , to Christian Bergh III and Elizabeth Bergh. [ 2 ] His father, an ethnic German , was a successful shipbuilder who had completed a series of contracts for the government. [ 3 ] Henry Bergh joined his father in 1835 at the C. Bergh & Co. , shipbuilding business. Upon his death in 1843, he left a large estate to the benefit of the three Bergh children, including Henry. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Bergh attended Columbia College in New York City, but left before completing his degree, deciding instead to tour Europe, where he remained for five years. [ 3 ] [ ] In 1862 Bergh entered government service when President Abraham Lincoln appointed him secretary of the U.S. legation in Tsarist Russia . [ 3 ] He served time in St. Petersburg as acting vice-consul. He resigned his position in 1864 owing to Russia's severe winter weather. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Advocacy [ edit ] [ edit ] Animal welfare [ edit ] [ edit ] During his stay in Europe, Bergh witnessed various cruelties committed upon animals, which affected him greatly. [ 3 ] In England Bergh met Lord Harrowby , president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , who impressed upon Bergh the importance of his mission, leading Bergh to dedicate the rest of his life to the cause of ending animal cruelty. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] On April 10, 1866, an act of incorporation of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was granted by the New York state legislature, with Bergh assuming the role of president of the new association, for which he received no financial compensation. [ 3 ] Bergh and his wife provided initial funding for the private organization , but after some time Bergh was requested to meet an old man in a hospital, Louis Bonard, a rich Frenchman who had earned a fortune trading animal furs. Bonard was full of praise for Bergh's work. He wanted to leave a fortune of $100,000 to the society. He said to Bergh, "I shall help you! Only if you promise that if ever you have the power, you will extend your protection to the wild things of forest and plain." Bergh promised and accepted the $100,000. [ 3 ] Branches of the ASPCA were subsequently established throughout the United States and Canada. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Under Bergh's leadership, the early ASPCA involved itself in a wide variety of issues, including slaughterhouse practices, animal transportation, care of horses, elimination of vivisection , cock fighting , and dog fighting , and the abolition of use of live pigeons in shooting matches. Bergh and the ASPCA are particularly credited for the use of clay pigeons in trap shooting. [ 3 ] [ ] During the 1872 outbreak of horse flu , Bergh stood wearing a top hat in the middle of New York City's streets and stopped horse-drawn trolleys and wagons being pulled by sick animals, sending them back to their stables. Although he was threatened with lawsuits by transit companies, his advocacy raised the profile of the cause. [ 4 ] [ ] In 1873, Bergh conducted a national lecture tour taking him across the American West . [ 3 ] He was also able to speak on the animal welfare cause before the Evangelical Alliance and the Episcopal convention, with the latter passing a resolution giving its clergy express permission to preach an annual sermon against cruelty to animals. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Child welfare [ edit ] [ edit ] 1870–1900 In 1874, Bergh was approached by a Methodist missionary named Etta Agnell Wheeler , who sought help rescuing a child named Mary Ellen Wilson from her cruel abuser, Mary Connolly. After Mary Ellen's story was heard, and she was subsequently rescued through Bergh's efforts, other complaints came in to Bergh. In response, Bergh himself, along with Elbridge T. Gerry and John D. Wright, formed the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NYSPCC ) in 1875. Over the coming years, other SPCC organizations were formed, such as the Massachusetts organization in 1888, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( MSPCC ). [ 5 ] [ ] Death and legacy [ edit ] [ edit ] Bergh died on March 12, 1888, in New York City. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow eulogized Bergh as "among the noblest in the land, Though he may count himself the least,That man I honour and revere, Who without favour,without fear,In the great city dares to stand The friend to every friendless beast." [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Henry Bergh is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn , New York . [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] A 1982 children's book about Bergh, The Man Who Loved Animals , was written by Syd Hoff . [ 10 ] [ ] In the spring of 2006 at Green-Wood Cemetery , while making preparations to honor Bergh, the ASPCA discovered that his wife was also in that mausoleum. On May 6, substantive ceremonies were held before a large audience which was allowed to bring their pets into the cemetery – including dogs, for the first time in over a century. [ 11 ] The NYPD Emerald Society bagpipers and ASPCA HLE Agents were there also. After a walk to Bergh's tomb, the bas-relief statue was revealed that now rests in front. At the same time as these ceremonies, in the cemetery's large chapel building an exhibit was opened celebrating the history of the ASPCA and Henry Bergh.

[ 2 ] He has studied and written about terrorism , [ 3 ] violence, [ 4 ] religion, [ 5 ] indigenous environmental management and the cross-cultural foundations of biological classification; [ 6 ] and he has done fieldwork with terrorists and Islamic fundamentalists, [ 7 ] as well as political leaders [ 8 ] and Native American peoples. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] Atran was born in New York City in 1952. While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist Margaret Mead at the American Museum of Natural History . He received his BA from Columbia College , MA from Johns Hopkins University , and PhD in anthropology from Columbia University . Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Atran has taught at Cambridge University , Hebrew University in Jerusalem , the École pratique des hautes études and École polytechnique in Paris, and John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. He is emeritus research director in anthropology at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and member of the Jean Nicod Institute at the École normale supérieure . He is also research professor of public policy and psychology at the University of Michigan , founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at Oxford University , and cofounder of ARTIS International . He was elected as a fellow of the Cognitive Science Society and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences . [ 9 ] [ ] Early years [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1974 he originated a debate at the Royaumont Abbey in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society. [ 10 ] Other participants included linguist Noam Chomsky , psychologist Jean Piaget , anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Claude Lévi-Strauss , [ 11 ] and biologists François Jacob and Jacques Monod . Howard Gardner and others consider this event a milestone in the development of cognitive science and its integration into the wider scientific community. [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Research [ edit ] [ edit ] Atran has experimented on the ways scientists and ordinary people categorize and reason about nature , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] on the evolutionary psychology and cognitive science of religion , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] and on the limits of rationality in understanding and managing deep-seated cultural and political conflict. His work has been widely published internationally in the popular press, and in scientific journals in a variety of disciplines. He has briefed members of the US Congress and the National Security Council staff with documents and presentations including "The Devoted Actor versus the Rational Actor in World Conflict", [ 20 ] "Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of Global Network Terrorism" [ 21 ] and "Pathways to and from Violent Extremism". [ 22 ] He was an early critic of U.S. intervention in Iraq [ 23 ] and of deepening involvement in Afghanistan. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In April 2015, he addressed the United Nations Security Council on "Youth, Peace, and Security." [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Atran has also been a staunch opponent of political attempts to eliminate government funding for social science, arguing that it is critical to the national interest, including innovation and security in business, technology, medicine and defense. [ 27 ] [ ] On conflict negotiation [ edit ] [ edit ] Atran has published research on the limits of rational choice in political and cultural conflict. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists Jeremy Ginges and Douglas Medin and political scientist Khalil Shikaki conducted an experiment that surveyed "600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad." [ 33 ] [ 34 ] : 638 The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each presented with a different "hypothetical peace deal." In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with "a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees"; the proposal "did not go over well." [ 34 ] : 638 For the second group, the hypothetical deal "was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence." [ 34 ] : 638–39 But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was "augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values." [ ] [ ] : 638 [ ] : 638 [ ] : 638–39 In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians "would give up any claims to their right of return" or "would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel"; [ 34 ] : 639 in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel "would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people," or would "give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank" or would "symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]". [ 33 ] In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker claims, "Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence." [ 34 ] : 639 [ ] : 639 [ ] [ ] : 639 In a study of Middle East leaders published in Science (journal) , Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well. [ 35 ] [ ] For example, when the researchers asked Mousa Abu Marzook , deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said “No.” When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said “No” even more emphatically; “we do not sell ourselves for any amount.” But when he was offered an apology, he said “Yes,” although an apology would only be a beginning. “Our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.” Similarly, when the researchers asked Binyamin Netanyahu (then opposition leader), “Would you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?” he said, “Yes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.” Atran has worked with the United Nations Security Council [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] and has been engaged in conflict negotiations in the Middle East. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Field research on terrorism [ edit ] [ edit ] His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with mujahedin and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded that many of the motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... [Atran shows that] Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups [hold] out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has [also] found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most effective call to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. [Atran writes that religion] may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil. [ 34 ] : 356–57 [ ] : 356–57 Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: When you look at young people like the ones who grew up to blow up trains in Madrid in 2004, carried out the slaughter on the London underground in 2005, hoped to blast airliners out of the sky en route to the United States in 2006 and 2009, and journeyed far to die killing infidels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; when you look at whom they idolize, how they organize, what bonds them and what drives them; then you see that what inspires the most lethal terrorists in the world today is not so much the Koran or religious teachings as a thrilling cause and call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends, and through friends, eternal respect and remembrance in the wider world that they will never live to enjoy.... Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool. [ ] : 357–58 Regarding Atran's analysis of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as a revolutionary movement of "world-historic proportions," [ 42 ] [ 43 ] a writer for The New York Times considers Atran: [ ] [ ] ...a top anthropologist in Paris [who has combined] his research among disaffected youth with insights from such disparate figures as Hitler, Burke, Darwin and Hobbes, as well as close observation of the Islamic State’s advance into a 'globe-spanning jihadi archipelago'. He argues that we dismiss ISIS at our peril, and that in fact, we do much to promote its growth. Some of his historical conclusions will be controversial, but this is French intellectualism at its most profound — and most useful. Here’s a telling anecdote: When Charlie Chaplin and the French filmmaker René Clair watched ' Triumph of the Will ' (1935), Leni Riefenstahl ’s visual paean to National Socialism, 'Chaplin laughed but Clair was terror-stricken, fearing that, if it were shown more widely, all might be lost in the West'. [ 44 ] [ ] The Chronicle of Higher Education accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing "will to fight" among the combatants: Atran  fleshes out what he calls the 'Devoted Actor Framework' [as opposed to standard 'rational actor' frameworks], which pulls sacred values [which are immune to material trade offs] and identity fusion [complete merging of individual identity with group identity] into a single theory and offers advice for beating ISIS: 'The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social networks that embed those values.' Left unspoken: How do you offer an equally inspiring alternative? By what method can those social networks be sundered? Atran doesn’t pretend to know the answer, but he does think that current attempts at so-called "countermessaging" are destined to fail because those messages are 'disembodied from the social networks in which ideas are embedded and given life.' Scholarly squabbles aside, there is near-universal admiration, bordering on awe, for how Atran is able to collect data in the midst of a violent conflict." [ 45 ] [ ] A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist Ángel Gómez [ 46 ] performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ), Peshmerga , Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to “help to inform policy decisions for the common defense.” According to reporting from CNN : [ ] The researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents. [But] 'in our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action,' [Atran] said. 'Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face.' [ 47 ] [ ] Atran argues in an interview in The Washington Post that: "Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear." [ 48 ] He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: [ ] Despite intense efforts by intelligence agencies and countless conferences, articles, and books, fundamental aspects of terrorism remain unclear: What identifies terrorists before they act; how do they radicalize; what motivates their violence; when do they act; what countermeasures are most effective? These efforts to find answers have fallen short in part because... policymakers tend to fit such information to prevailing paradigms in foreign policy, military doctrine, and criminal justice, each with serious drawbacks when applied to terrorism." [ 49 ] [ ] Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict', [ 50 ] the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict. Atran and his team have validated aspects of these behavioral findings in neuroimaging studies of radicalized individuals in Europe, including greater willingness to fight and die for sacred versus non-sacred values that involves inhibition of deliberative reasoning in favor of rapid, duty-bound responses. [ 51 ] [ ] [ ] Other work [ edit ] [ edit ] Atran conducts ongoing research in Guatemala, Mexico, and the U.S. on universal and culture-specific aspects of biological categorization and environmental reasoning and decision making among Maya and other Native Americans. [ 52 ] His research team has focused on immigration of Spanish-speaking Ladinos and highland Q'eqchi' people of Guatemala into the northern lowland Petén region, [ 53 ] and their interaction with the lowland Itza whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry practices, including use of dietary and medicinal plants, may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the Maya lowlands. [ 54 ] Atran found that the Itza' rejected majority-culture offers for exploiting natural resources as violating spiritual injunctions that may represent the summary wisdom of centuries of experience; however, later follow-up studies suggest that this wisdom, and the sustainable practices it encouraged, are vanishing as the last Itza speakers die out. [ 55 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Atran's debates with Sam Harris , Dan Dennett , Richard Dawkins and others during the 2006 Beyond Belief symposium on the limits of reason and the role of religion in modern society highlight the differences between these authors, who see religion as fundamentally false beliefs associated with primitive cosmology, as well as politically and socially repressive, and Atran who sees unfalsifiable but semantically absurd religious beliefs and binding ritual obligations as historically critical to the formation and social cohesion of large-scale societies and current motivators for both conflict and cooperation.

E. Shaw & Co. Notable work Juno Online Services Hard Case Crime Edgar Award (2007) Shamus Award (2008) Ellery Queen Award (2015) Inkpot Award (2024) Charles Ardai is an American businessman, and writer of crime fiction and mysteries. He is co-founder and editor of Hard Case Crime , a line of pulp-style paperback crime novels. He was also an early employee of D. E. Shaw & Co. and a managing director of the firm. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is the former chairman of Schrödinger, Inc. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life [ edit ] [ edit ] A New York native and the son of two Holocaust survivors , Ardai told NPR in a May 2008 interview that the stories his parents told him as a child "were the most grim and frightening that you can imagine" and gave him the impression "there was a darker circle around a very small bit of light," something that enabled him to relate to his own characters' sufferings. [ 4 ] [ ] While in high school, Ardai enjoyed reading pulp fiction and worked as an intern at Isaac Asimov ’s Science Fiction Magazine . [ 5 ] [ ] After graduating from Hunter College High School in 1987, he attended Columbia University , where he graduated summa cum laude in 1991. [ 6 ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Right out of college, Ardai was hired by hedge fund D. E. Shaw . [ 5 ] His first job at the firm was to set up its recruiting department, [ 7 ] with a goal of hiring "people who really excel in one field or another." [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Sometime in the early 1990s, Shaw tasked Ardai and Jeff Bezos with coming up with potential online business ideas. [ 9 ] While Ardai founded Juno , an internet company, in 1996 with D. E. Shaw as an investor, [ 5 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Bezos went on to found Amazon.com on his own. [ 9 ] After Juno was sold in 2001, Ardai and Max Phillips decided to start a publishing company to publish crime fiction in the pulp magazine style they grew up enjoying. That proposed company became Hard Case Crime , which published its first books in 2004. [ 12 ] Hard Case's books were produced by Dorchester Publishing and Ardai's Winterfall, LLC between 2004 and 2010 and have been produced by Titan Books and Winterfall since 2011 (together with a related comics imprint launched in 2016). [ 13 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Ardai's writing has appeared in mystery magazines such as Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine , gaming magazines such as Computer Gaming World and Electronic Games , and anthologies such as Best Mysteries of the Year and The Year's Best Horror Stories . Ardai has also edited numerous short story collections such as The Return of the Black Widowers , Great Tales of Madness and the Macabre , and Futurecrime . [ 14 ] [ ] In 1994, Ardai's short story "Nobody Wins," published in 1993 by Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine , received a Shamus nomination for Best P.I. Short Story. [ 15 ] [ ] His first novel, Little Girl Lost (2004) was nominated for both the Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America and the Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America. [ 16 ] His second novel, Songs of Innocence , was called "an instant classic" by The Washington Post , [ 17 ] selected as one of the best books of the year by Publishers Weekly , [ 18 ] and won the 2008 Shamus Award. [ 19 ] Both books were written under the alias Richard Aleas and were optioned for the movies by Universal Pictures. [ 20 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He received the Edgar Award in 2007 for the short story "The Home Front". [ 21 ] Ardai's third novel, Fifty-to-One , was published in November 2008. [ 22 ] It was the fiftieth book in the Hard Case Crime series and the first to be published under Ardai's real name. [ ] [ ] His fourth novel, Hunt Through the Cradle of Fear , is part of a pulp adventure series he created in 2009, describing the globetrotting exploits of a modern-day explorer named Gabriel Hunt. Authorship of all the books in this series were originally credited to Gabriel Hunt himself. [ 23 ] [ ] In 2010, Ardai began working as a writer and producer on the SyFy television series Haven , [ 24 ] inspired by the Hard Case Crime novel The Colorado Kid by Stephen King . [ 25 ] The pilot episode of Haven premiered on July 9, 2010 [ 26 ] and the series finale premiered on December 17, 2015.

The book, which is drawn by Ang Hor Kheng, and features covers by Bill Sienkiewicz , Robert McGinnis , and Adam Hughes , centers upon weapons smuggler Joanna Tan, who after helping a convict escape prison, is chosen by the U.S. government to track him down and return him. [ 13 ] The four-issue miniseries was conceived by Ardai when he conceived of Hard Case Crime Comics five years prior, [ 30 ] and he has likened Gun Honey to other espionage action thrillers that influenced it, such as James Bond , [ 31 ] as well as action/adventure stories featuring female protagonists, such as Modesty Blaise , Alias , Kill Bill , [ 30 ] and Barbarella . [ 31 ] At the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, the debut issue has a rating of 8 out of 10, based on eight critics' reviews. [ 32 ] The story was followed by a sequel, Gun Honey: Blood for Blood , in which Joanna and her ally, a government agent named Brook Barrow, are framed for murder [ 31 ] by a vengeful rival of Joanna's. [ 33 ] That miniseries premiered August 24, 2022. [ 34 ] It was followed by a four-issue spinoff series, Heat Seeker: A Gun Honey Series , also written by Ardai, with art by Ace Continuado, Jose Zapata, and Asifur Rahman. The book, whose debut issue was released on June 28, 2023, sees Tan going on the run after she is targeted for assassination by the U.S. government. Pursued by a beautiful sociopathic hitwoman named Sarah Claride, Tan seeks help from her friend, stage magician and illusionist Dahlia Racers, who specializes in helping people disappear. [ 31 ] [ 35 ] The next installment in the series was the miniseries Gun Honey: Collision Course , whose debut issue was released May 15, 2024.

Our Terms of Use Our Terms of Use Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ("we" or "us" or "Foundation"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge. To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page ) (hereby referred to as "Projects") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity. We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use"). Overview These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as "Project Websites") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition). You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain. Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety. For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content.   1. Our Services The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here . However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as "Application Programming Interface" or "APIs"), and mobile applications. As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host , technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users: We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws.   2. Privacy Policy We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy , so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.   3. Content We Host You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites.   4. Refraining from Certain Activities The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ("UCoC"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host. Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include: Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC; Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users; Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy. Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content); Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors. Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America; Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others; Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and Engaging in fraud. Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law. Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material; Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law. Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users; Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community; Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website; Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose; Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met: such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks; such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work); you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.     You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways: a statement on your user page, a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions. In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service. Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled "Paid Contributions Without Disclosure") when contributing to that particular Project. We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy . If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action. Marketing Company Mediations Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies . Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding "Med-Arb" (a "Marketing Company Mediation") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use.   5. Password Security You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party.   6. Trademarks Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy .   7. Licensing of Content To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it. You agree to the following licensing requirements: Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Reusers may comply with either license or both. The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature.

Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons . You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL. You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.  Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy , and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons.  No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.  Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.  Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s). When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature). When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available. With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.   8. DMCA Compliance The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services. However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legal wikimedia org or snail mail our designated agent .     Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page . Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at info wikimedia org .       9. Third-party Websites and Resources You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.   10. Management of Websites The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly . However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community. Each Project will usually provide "Help" or "Contact" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to info wikimedia org or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page . Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands.     If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to: Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request; Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests; Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use; Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles; Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public. Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ("Denial of Service") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request . In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies. The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition. Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy . In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures. The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use. If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal .  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages. We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures.   11. Resolutions and Project Policies The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.   12. API Terms We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy , the Robot Policy , and the API:Etiquette (collectively, "API Documentation"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.   13. Termination Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18.   14. Disputes and Jurisdiction 14. Disputes and Jurisdiction We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use. To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred). Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally. You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services. Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed "prevailing" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted. If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section.   15. Disclaimers 15. Disclaimers Highlighted for emphasis At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure. We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.   16. Limitation on Liability 16. Limitation on Liability Highlighted for emphasis   17. Modifications to these Terms of Use Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice. Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l . However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.   18. Other Terms These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting "under the authority of" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control. You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites. If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision. You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. Thank You!  We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services.

Biography [ edit ] [ edit ] Bauman was born on March 2, 1912, to Allen and Minnie Bauman in the Bronx, New York City . [ 1 ] He attended James Monroe High School , then was granted a fellowship to the Juilliard Graduate School of Music during his freshman year at Columbia College in 1930, making him the first and only student to attend both institutions concurrently. He studied voice with Francis Rogers at Juilliard. [ ] During the 1930's he became active in the communist political movement within the United States, and made several recordings for the Timely Recording Company, with a group under the name " The New Singers " where they recorded English language versions of well known communist songs. [ 2 ] In 1938, Mordecai Bauman made the first recordings of a group of six songs by Charles Ives -- recorded by Musicraft and issued on a 78 rpm disc by New Music [Quarterly] Recordings (1412). [ 3 ] These are described in the book SONG ON RECORD, edited by Alan Blyth in 1988. [ ] [ ] In 1941, he was the narrator in the world premiere of Paul Bunyan by Benjamin Britten and Wystan Hugh Auden .  This performance was at Columbia University. He married Irma Commanday. Together, they started the Indian Hill Art Workshop in Stockbridge, Massachusetts . Indian Hill was the first summer school in the arts for high school students. [ 4 ] It was open until 1978. [ ] During the Bach Tercentenary in 1985, he led a tour to the Bach Festival in Leipzig . A few years later, he completed a documentary, "The Stations of Bach", in East Germany . The documentary was funded by the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities and broadcast nationally on PBS in 1990. CUNY TV now owns the documentary and broadcasts it annually on Bach's birthday, March 21. In 2006, Mordecai and Irma published their memoir, titled, From our Angle of Repose . He died in 2007 at the age of 95. [ 5 ] [ ] References [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ "Remembering Mordy" . Indian Hill Arts Workshop . Retrieved 2018-07-09 . ^ "Remembering Mordy" . Indian Hill Arts Workshop .

Richardson , Jean Brossel  Francis Bitter (July 22, 1902 – July 26, 1967) was an American physicist . [ 1 ] [ ] Bitter invented the Bitter plate used in resistive magnets (also called Bitter electromagnets ). He also developed the water cooling method inherent to the design of Bitter magnets. Prior to this development, there was no way to cool electromagnets , limiting their maximum flux density. Early life [ edit ] [ edit ] Francis Bitter was born in Weehawken, New Jersey . His father, Karl Bitter , was a prominent sculptor. Bitter entered the University of Chicago in 1919, but chose to leave his studies there in 1922 to visit Europe.  He later transferred to Columbia University and graduated in 1925. [ 2 ] He continued his studies in Berlin from 1925 to 1926 and received a PhD at Columbia in 1928. At Columbia, Bitter began his lifelong fascination with magnets. [ citation needed ] [ ] citation needed Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Under a National Research Council fellowship, Bitter studied gases at Caltech with Robert Andrews Millikan , from 1928 to 1930.  While at Caltech, he married the Sheffield -born Alice Coomaraswamy .  She had been a moderately successful singer working under the stage name Ratan Devi. [ 3 ] [ ] In 1930, Bitter went to work for Westinghouse , where he worked on various theoretical and applied problems concerning ferromagnetism . [ citation needed ] citation needed With a Guggenheim Fellowship , Bitter travelled to England in 1933 and worked at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University .  There, he worked with Peter Kapitza on pulsed magnetic fields. [ citation needed ] citation needed The following year, Bitter returned to America and his work at Westinghouse.  Later in 1934, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and continued to consult for Westinghouse. [ citation needed ] citation needed At M.I.T. [ edit ] [ edit ] Bitter joined the Department of Mining and Metallurgy as an associate professor in 1934.  (The department is now known as Materials Science and Engineering.) [ citation needed ] citation needed While at MIT, he developed the Bitter electromagnet which was/is the most powerful electromagnet design.  He established a magnet laboratory in 1938, where he built a solenoid magnet that produced a constant field of 100,000 gauss (10 teslas ). [ citation needed ] citation needed He also did work in the first characterization of the Zeeman effect with George Harrison. [ citation needed ] citation needed During the Second World War, Bitter worked for the Naval Bureau of Ordnance .  He often traveled to England to find ways to demagnetize British ships to protect them from a new type of German mine, which used a compass needle to trigger detonation.  The mine, dropped from the air, would sink to the bottom of a river and remain there with its magnetic needle aligned to the Earth's magnetic field at that location.  When a ship passed over it, the mass of the ship caused the magnetic needle to move slightly.  The movement was enough to detonate the mine.  In his autobiography Magnets, the Education of a Physicist , he referred to this unique work as "Degaussing the fleet".  (It is possible that he worked with Francis Crick , who was researching the same problem.) [ citation needed ] citation needed After the war, Bitter returned to MIT and joined the faculty of the physics department.  He became a full professor in 1951, and from 1956 to 1960, he served as associate dean of MIT's school of science.  From 1962 to 1965, Bitter was the housemaster of Ashdown House, MIT's graduate dormitory. [ citation needed ] citation needed Legacy [ edit ] [ edit ] The Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory , formerly a national laboratory, [ 4 ] in Cambridge is named in his honor.

GCB GCB Early life, family and education  [ edit ] [ edit ] Auchmuty was born in New York City in 1758, and educated at King's College , the progenitor of today's Columbia University , where he graduated in 1775. Auchmuty's grandfather, Robert Auchmuty (d. 1750), was descended from a family settled in Fife , Scotland , in the 14th century. Robert Auchmuty's father (Samuel's great grandfather) had moved to Ireland in 1699, and Robert emigrated to America and settled in Boston , where he practised law with success. Robert Auchmuty was appointed to the court of admiralty in 1703, which office he resigned shortly afterward; but he was reappointed in 1733. He was in England in 1741 as agent for the colony, and in that year published in London a pamphlet entitled The Importance of Cape Breton to the British Nation, and a Plan for Taking the Place . Auchmuty's father, also named Samuel (16 January 1722 Boston – 6 March 1777 New York City ), was a clergyman. He graduated from Harvard in 1742, studied theology in England, and was appointed assistant minister of Trinity Church in New York . In 1764 he became rector, and had charge of all the churches in the city. He continued to read prayers for the king during the American Revolutionary War , until Lord Stirling , in command at New York, compelled him to desist; whereupon he locked the churches and withdrew to New Jersey , ordering that no services should be held until the prayers could be read without abridgment. When the British captured New York he passed the American lines amid great hardships. He found his church and parsonage burned and the church records destroyed. The exposure that he underwent in order to evade the American sentries caused his death. His uncle, son of Auchmuty's grandfather and also named Robert (born in Boston; died December 1788 in Marylebone , London), was an eloquent and successful advocate in Boston.  He was one of the counsel for the soldiers engaged in the Boston Massacre , and became a judge of admiralty in 1769; but in 1776, being a zealous Loyalist, he withdrew to England. His and Thomas Hutchinson 's letters from Boston to England, which were sent back to the colonies by Benjamin Franklin in 1773, caused great excitement. [ 2 ] [ ] Auchmuty's sister Jane was the mother of Colonel William Tylden of the Royal Engineers . [ 3 ] [ ] Auchmuty married Elizabeth Domvile Savage, only daughter of Francis Savage. Their second son was General Samuel Benjamin Auchmuty , [ 4 ] [ ] Military career [ edit ] [ edit ] A loyalist, during the American War of Independence he was given an ensigncy in the loyal army in 1777, and in 1778 a lieutenancy in the 45th Foot , without purchase. When his regiment returned to England after the war, having neither private means nor influence, he exchanged into the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot , in order to proceed to India . [ 5 ] [ ] He took part in the last war against Hyder Ali ; he was given a staff appointment by Lord Cornwallis in 1790, served in the operations against Tippoo Sahib , and continued in various staff appointments up to 1797, when he returned to England a brevet lieutenant-colonel . [ 5 ] [ ] In 1800 he was made lieutenant-colonel and brevet colonel; and in the following year, as Adjutant-general to Sir David Baird in Egypt, took a distinguished share in the march across the desert and the Capture of Alexandria . On his return to England in 1803 he was knighted, and three years later he went out to the Río de la Plata as a brigadier-general . Auchmuty was one of the few officers who came out of the disastrous Buenos Aires expedition of 1806-7 with enhanced reputation. While General John Whitelocke , the commander, was cashiered , Auchmuty was at once re-employed and promoted to major-general .  In 1810 he was appointed to command the Madras Army . [ 5 ] [ ] In the following year he commanded the expedition organized for the conquest of Java , which the governor-general, Lord Minto , himself accompanied. The storming of the strongly fortified position of Meester Cornelis (28 August 1811), stubbornly defended by a Dutch garrison under General Janssens , practically achieved conquest of the island, and after the action of Samarang (8 September 1811) Janssens surrendered. Auchmuty received the thanks of Parliament and was appointed KCB and, on his return home, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general . In 1822 he became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland , and a member of the Irish privy council. He died suddenly in August 1822.

Edward Winslow Ames Jr. ( 1907-07-03 ) July 3, 1907 Maullín, Chile ( 1907-07-03 ) 1907-07-03 October 3, 1990 (1990-10-03) (aged 83) Wakefield, Rhode Island , US (1990-10-03) American Harvard University Columbia University Harvard University Columbia University Art historian museum director academic Art historian museum director academic University of Rhode Island Springfield Art Museum Gallery of Modern Art Hollins College Brown University Connecticut College Lyman Allyn Art Museum Edward Winslow Ames Jr. (July 3, 1907 –  October 3, 1990) was an American art historian , author, and museum director. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] His academic research focused on  Victorian art, but he "also had a deep interest in Modernism and the art of his own period". [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life [ edit ] [ edit ] Ames was born in Maullín, Chile , where his father was a diplomat and later worked for Companier de Maderes del Ato Parana, a lumber company. [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 5 ] His parents were Katherine Millicent (née Johnson) and Edward "Ted" Winslow Ames. [ 6 ] [ 5 ] His grandfather was Azel Ames , a noted physician and author. [ 7 ] However, Ames recalled, "The Ames family was not rich. My mother was." [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The family went back and forth between the United States and Latin America, but he was primarily raised in Staten Island, New York, and Boston, Massachusetts. [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 5 ] In 1917, his father was the diplomat for Guatemala where Ames witnessed the impact of war and extreme poverty. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He attended Staten Island Academy and went to Phillips-Andover Academy in 1921. [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Although his father wanted him to attend Harvard, Ames wanted to go elsewhere because "there were too many people going to Harvard from Andover". [ 5 ] He chose Columbia University , receiving a B.A. in 1929 after 3.5 years. [ 2 ] While at Columbia, he took up rowing and joined the social and literary Fraternity of Delta Psi ( St. Anthony Hall ) which Ames says was crucial to stimulating his interest in the arts. [ 5 ] He also attended exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 1932, he received an MA in art history from Harvard University where he studied with Paul J. Sachs and Edward W. Forbes . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 5 ] While at Harvard, he lived in the Delta Psi M.I.T. chapter house. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] With the assistance of Paul J. Sachs, Ames secured a position as founding director of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London, Connecticut . [ 1 ] [ 8 ] [ 3 ] He began work in 1930 while the museum was still under construction and had no items in its collection. [ 8 ] [ 5 ] The New York Times noted, "Winslow Ames, the director, has mapped out an acquisition program that, as it develops, out to make the museum both distinctive and peculiarly valuable." [ 8 ] He started collecting drawings and New London County or early furniture, and decided to focus on drawings, prints, and sculptures. [ 8 ] [ 5 ] He also created a library and collection of lantern slides for the museum. [ 5 ] He did not collect modern art because the museum's trustees "weren't particularly keen on it." [ 5 ] He worked at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum until 1942. [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] After World War II, he spent a year studying Prince Albert and Victorian art in England and Germany. [ 5 ] This eventually led to a book, Prince Albert and Victorian Taste that was published by Viking in 1967. [ 5 ] [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He was the first paid director of the Springfield Art Museum in Springfield Missouri , from 1947 to 1950. [ 1 ] [ 9 ] [ 6 ] From 1957 to 1961, he was the first director of Huntington Hartford 's Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle in Manhattan, working with the collection before the museum opened to the public. [ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He taught at several colleges and universities, including Connecticut College in the 1930s, Brown University in the 1940s, Hollins College from 1964 to 1965, and University of Rhode Island from 1966 to 1972 and 1973–1975. [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] He also did some appraisal work, especially with early furniture and drawings. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Prefab houses [ edit ] [ edit ] While at the Century of Progress world exhibition in Chicago in 1933, Ames saw General House's model home and met Howard T. Fisher , its chief architect. [ 10 ] He believed these prefabricated houses were the future with their "stark International-style appearance". [ 3 ] He had two of these structures built on the property of Lyman Allyn Art Museum where he was employed as the museum's director. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In November 1933, he commissioned General House to erect the House of Steel, a prefab house. [ 10 ] [ 3 ] He also commissioned American Homes, Inc. and architect Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr. to construct an International style prefabricated "Moto Home" now known as the Winslow Ames House . [ 3 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Ames used these houses as rental properties, although they lived in the Moto Home for a short time. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Both houses were sold to Connecticut College in 1949. [ 3 ] [ 13 ] [ 10 ] The Winslow Ames House underwent extensive restoration in 1994, with funding from the Connecticut Historical Commission, and is on the National Register of Historic Places . [ 3 ] [ 14 ] The House of Steel survives, but was significantly modified.

Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt [ 1 ] was born on August 12, 1975, in Falmouth, Massachusetts , to Christine Anne "Chris" Boldt and Timothy Byers Affleck. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The surname "Affleck" is of Scottish origin. [ 5 ] He also has Irish, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] German, [ 8 ] English, and Swedish ancestry. [ 9 ] [ full citation needed ] Affleck's maternal great-great-grandfather, Heinrich Boldt , known for the discovery of the Curmsun Disc , emigrated from Prussia in the late 1840s. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] His mother was a Radcliffe College - and Harvard -educated elementary school teacher. His father worked sporadically as an auto mechanic, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] a carpenter, [ 14 ] a bookie , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] an electrician, [ 17 ] a bartender, [ 18 ] and a janitor at Harvard University. [ 19 ] In the mid-1960s, he had been a stage manager, director, writer and actor with the Theater Company of Boston . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] During Affleck's childhood, his father was "a disaster of a drinker". [ 23 ] Affleck first started acting by "reenacting what was happening at home" during role play exercises at Alateen meetings. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] full citation needed Heinrich Boldt Heinrich Boldt [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] After his parents divorced when he was nine, Affleck and his older brother, Ben , lived with their mother and visited their father weekly. [ 23 ] He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around Mexico with his mother and brother when he was ten. [ 25 ] At the time, his brother Ben was filming The Second Voyage of the Mimi , which was set in Mexico. The two brothers spent "all of our time together, pretty much. Obviously at school we were in different grades, but we had the same friends." [ 25 ] When Affleck was fourteen, his father moved to Indio, California , to enter a rehabilitation facility, and later worked there as an addiction counselor. [ 17 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] He reconnected with his father during visits to California as a teenager: "I got to know him, really, because he was sober for the first time ... The man I knew before that was just completely different." [ 23 ] [ 29 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Growing up in a politically active, liberal household in Central Square, Cambridge , [ 15 ] [ 30 ] Affleck and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts, [ 31 ] were regularly taken to the theater by their mother, [ 32 ] and were encouraged to make their own home movies. [ 33 ] The brothers sometimes appeared in local weather commercials and as film extras because of their mother's friendship with a local casting director. [ 18 ] [ 29 ] [ 34 ] Affleck acted in numerous high school theater productions while a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School . [ 29 ] [ 35 ] He has said he "wouldn't be an actor" if not for his high school theater teacher Gerry Speca: "He kind of turned me on to acting, why it can be fun, how it can be rewarding." [ 35 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] At age eighteen, Affleck moved to Los Angeles for a year to pursue an acting career, and lived with his brother and their childhood friend Matt Damon . [ 36 ] Despite having "the best possible first experience" while filming To Die For , [ 37 ] he spent much of the year working as a busboy at a restaurant in Pasadena . He decided to move to Washington, D.C. , to study politics at George Washington University . [ 18 ] He soon transferred to Columbia University in New York City , where he followed the Core Curriculum for a total of two years. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] However, he did not graduate: "I would do a semester of school, go do a movie ... Opportunities kept presenting themselves that were hard for me to turn down ... By then, I didn't really have roots at the school or a group of friends." [ 37 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] 1988–2006: Early work  [ edit ] [ edit ] Affleck acted professionally during his childhood due to his mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, Patty Collinge. [ 37 ] In addition to local weather commercials and film extra work, [ 41 ] he appeared as Kevin Bacon 's brother in the PBS television film Lemon Sky (1988), directed by Collinge's husband Jan Egleson, [ 37 ] and as a young Robert F. Kennedy in the ABC miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990). [ 42 ] These early acting experiences "meant nothing more than a day off from school" to Affleck, and he only began to consider a career as an actor when in high school. [ 41 ] When he later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in earnest, his first film role was as a sociopathic teenager in Gus Van Sant 's 1995 satirical comedy To Die For . During filming in Toronto , Affleck shared an apartment with co-star Joaquin Phoenix and they became close friends. [ 33 ] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Affleck's performance, saying he "skillfully capture[s] the pang of adolescence among no-hopers." [ 43 ] [ 44 ] However, Affleck then had a "disappointing" experience while making the 1996 drama Race the Sun and, "as soon as the film finished, I went to school." [ 39 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] While studying at Columbia, Affleck had a supporting role in Van Sant's Good Will Hunting (1997), written by his brother and their childhood friend Matt Damon . [ 18 ] [ 37 ] Despite arranging a first meeting between Van Sant and his brother to discuss the project, Affleck was reluctant to leave college temporarily to act in the film. [ 39 ] He was eventually persuaded to play one of four friends living in South Boston – a role written specifically for him [ 36 ] – and improvised many of his lines. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe praised the "emotional subtleties and variety" of the performances, and singled out "Casey Affleck's junior member of the quartet, dying to be taken as seriously as the others." [ 47 ] Following the film's success, Affleck's career opportunities did not significantly improve. At the same time, his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became "part of pop culture and public life." [ 18 ] Also in 1997, he had a small role in Kevin Smith 's Chasing Amy , starring his brother. He returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career. [ 39 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck's career entered a "dark" period, with a series of supporting roles in critical and commercial failures. [ 36 ] [ 33 ] He later remarked: "It dawned on me late that I should be selective about what I do." [ 37 ] In the independent comedy Desert Blue (1998), he starred opposite Kate Hudson as a small-town jock. [ 48 ] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while "interesting", his character was "entirely underdeveloped". [ 49 ] In 1999, he made an uncredited appearance in the teen comedy American Pie [ 50 ] and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with both Gaby Hoffmann and Christina Ricci 's characters in the New Year's Eve ensemble comedy 200 Cigarettes . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In the comedy Drowning Mona (2000), starring Danny DeVito , Affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder. [ 53 ] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times acknowledged, in an otherwise negative review, that his role was "well played". [ 54 ] Also in 2000, Affleck had a small role in the comedy Attention Shoppers and played Fortinbras in Ethan Hawke 's Hamlet . [ 55 ] He appeared as the brother of Heather Graham 's character in the romantic comedy Committed (2000), with Emanuel Levy of Variety praising a "terrific" performance. [ 56 ] Also in 2001, he had a small role in American Pie 2 and appeared in the teen slasher film Soul Survivors . Robert Koehler of Variety found him "bland" [ 57 ] while Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle said that he did not make "much of an impression, [but may] have been too depressed to really act." [ 58 ] One positive experience Affleck had during this period was working with Van Sant and cinematographer Harris Savides on Finding Forrester (2000) as Van Sant's assistant and technical consultant: "Can you imagine a better film school than that? Gus is not only somebody who I love a lot but is also who has taught me, maybe more than anybody else in film." [ 33 ] [ 59 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast in Steven Soderbergh 's heist comedy Ocean's Eleven (2001), starring George Clooney , Brad Pitt and Damon. In roles Soderbergh originally intended for Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson , [ 60 ] Affleck and Scott Caan played Mormon brothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. [ 61 ] While it was a "great, fun social experience", Affleck spent much of his time on set "being, like, 100 feet away from the camera in the background." [ 36 ] He would later reprise his role in Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2002, Affleck and Damon starred in Van Sant's experimental drama Gerry , playing two men who get lost while hiking in the desert. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Affleck, Damon, and Van Sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring New York apartments. [ 45 ] The film, which had minimal dialogue, received mixed reviews. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Affleck, who rarely watches his own films, [ 61 ] said of Gerry in 2016: "That was an incredible experience. I saw one scene recently out of context at the Telluride Film Festival and I can't believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing. It probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out – I thought, 'This is unbearable!'" [ 37 ] Also in 2002, Affleck starred with Damon and then-girlfriend Summer Phoenix in a West End stage production of Kenneth Lonergan 's This Is Our Youth . [ 18 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Lonergan and Affleck became friends during rehearsals, [ 68 ] and Affleck later acted in workshop productions of Lonergan's plays in New York. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck's first leading role was in 2006's little-seen independent comedy-drama Lonesome Jim , directed by Steve Buscemi . He played a depressed writer who returns from New York to live with his parents in Indiana, and begins a relationship with Liv Tyler 's character. [ 71 ] Buscemi has said he knew Affleck would be able to carry the film after watching his performance in Gerry . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post remarked: "Affleck's interesting .. He probably can't be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine ... And yet in certain kinds of films – this kind – he's 100 percent authentic." [ 74 ] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said Affleck "gets so far under the skin of this semi-charming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating." [ 75 ] However, Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt it "would be a stronger movie if Mr. Affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passive-aggressive rage inside ... a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details." [ 76 ] Also in 2006, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy The Last Kiss as a friend of Zach Braff 's character. [ 77 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 2007–2012: Breakthrough  [ edit ] [ edit ] Affleck had a breakthrough year in 2007, with the release of two films featuring critically acclaimed performances. [ 78 ] The first of these performances was in the Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford , in which he played Robert Ford to Brad Pitt 's Jesse James . [ 79 ] Affleck auditioned repeatedly for the role. [ 80 ] While the director Andrew Dominik had seen Affleck in Gerry , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] he cast him partly because of his "beautiful-sounding voice. The voice is the thing that really gets you." [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described Affleck's performance as a "revelation" which "manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart." [ 85 ] Similarly, Claudia Puig of USA Today declared him a "real revelation [who] perfectly inhabits the role" [ 86 ] while Todd McCarthy of Variety said Affleck made "an indelible impression as the insecure, physically unprepossessing weakling." [ 87 ] Dana Stevens of Slate said "the movie belongs to Affleck [who] goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif Bob. Somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed, even as we pray no harm will come to him." For his performance, Affleck was nominated for the Golden Globe Award , Screen Actors Guild Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] While he was filming The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford in Calgary , Affleck was visited by his brother, who offered him the leading role in his directorial project, the Boston crime thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007). [ 37 ] While his brother was a first-time director and in the midst of a career downturn, Affleck had confidence in the project: "I felt like I knew him better than anyone else did." [ 37 ] [ 88 ] His performance, as an inexperienced private investigator tasked with finding a missing child, earned Affleck further plaudits for his acting. [ 89 ] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said: "I'm not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor ... Most actors want you to love them, but [he] doesn't seem to know that, or maybe he doesn't care." [ 90 ] Jim Ridley of The Village Voice described him as "a major talent coming into his own" [ 91 ] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that "the revelation is Casey Affleck, who heretofore has been a rather wormy, uncharismatic screen presence." [ 92 ] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe commented: "I'd never stopped to consider Casey Affleck as a movie star before, but under his big brother's tutelage, he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence." [ 93 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] While The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Gone Baby Gone were, respectively, a financial failure and a modest box office success, [ 83 ] [ 94 ] Affleck's acting career was widely believed to be at a turning point. [ 33 ] However, he lost career momentum while directing I'm Still Here (2010), a divisive mockumentary about the musical career of his friend and then brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenix . [ 33 ] While Affleck later clarified that it was "a planned, staged and scripted work of fiction", [ 95 ] there was much media speculation during filming about whether Phoenix's public behavior was performance art or a genuine breakdown. [ 96 ] Claudia Puig of USA Today remarked that, "whether truth or folly, it's not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix's most oddball and obsessive torment, it's boring ... What, exactly, is the point of a joke that nobody really gets?" [ 97 ] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described it as "an interesting but half-baked exercise in persona deconstruction, celebrity politics, and meta-meta-entertainment ... Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch." [ 98 ] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the film "turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch." [ 99 ] Reflecting on the experience in 2016, Affleck said: "We never thought people would actually think it was real ... In hindsight, we should have had a press junket and done talk shows and said how it was a mockumentary." [ 70 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck used his own money to fund I'm Still Here and, after running out of cash, [ 95 ] filming was paused for a month to allow him to play a Texan serial killer in Michael Winterbottom 's crime drama The Killer Inside Me (2010). [ 100 ] Affleck later expressed regret over the film's graphic violence. [ 70 ] Philip French of The Guardian found him "disturbingly brilliant" [ 101 ] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised "a mesmeric, implosively powerful performance." [ 102 ] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said Affleck "showcases his uncanny ability to project a person holding two thoughts in his head at once, as he often gives away nothing in his face to convey the firestorm obviously raging in his soul." [ 103 ] Affleck then had a supporting role in the heist comedy Tower Heist (2011) [ 104 ] and voiced a character in the 2012 animation ParaNorman . [ 105 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 2013–present: Wider recognition  [ edit ] [ edit ] After spending "a big chunk of time" directing I'm Still Here and dealing with the subsequent backlash, [ 106 ] Affleck returned to regular acting work in 2013. "It was ugly for a minute ... I sort of remembered why I liked acting and I missed it." [ 59 ] In David Lowery 's Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013), Affleck and Rooney Mara starred as outlaw lovers in 1970s-era Texas. [ 107 ] Affleck was drawn to the opportunity to play a character who "was a much better person than anyone thought", after a string of roles as "assassins or murderers or just creeps". [ 107 ] Shannon M. Houston of Paste described him as the film's "standout actor": "Down to his very jawline, Affleck captures the physicality and feeling of a sincerely romantic outlaw." [ 108 ] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked: "Affleck plays conflicted souls so very well ... Here you wish for a criminal's redemption." [ 109 ] Matt Pais of the Chicago Tribune said: "He has great instincts when it comes to morally compromised anti-heroes, and without trolling for our sympathy, Affleck's Bob is more than just a collection of behaviors; it's a smartly considered performance." [ 110 ] Sebastian Doggart of The Guardian said he "shows himself again to be a master of the criminal outsider" [ 111 ] while Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice found him "flat-out heartbreaking". [ 112 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The opportunity to act opposite Christian Bale in the drama Out of the Furnace "reinvigorated" Affleck and reminded him why he enjoyed acting. [ 113 ] Claudia Puig of USA Today found his performance as an Iraq War veteran dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder "completely captivating ... The chemistry between Bale and Affleck is powerful, intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond." [ 114 ] Matt Pais of the Chicago Tribune said Affleck "finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his character's rage. He's not like any other actor in American movies." [ 110 ] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described the performance as "a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis." [ 115 ] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times remarked that Affleck "can come across as intensely vulnerable on screen, which nicely works for a broken man like Rodney." [ 116 ] In 2014, Affleck and Jessica Chastain had supporting roles in Christopher Nolan 's science fiction film Interstellar as the grown-up children of Matthew McConaughey 's character, [ 117 ] with Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter describing his character as "thinly developed". [ 118 ] Also in 2014, Affleck and producer John Powers Middleton launched the production company, The Affleck/Middleton Project. [ 119 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck starred in three films in 2016, the first two of which underperformed financially. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] In John Hillcoat 's crime thriller Triple 9 , Affleck played an uncorruptible detective. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said he "arrests our attention. I wonder if any other screen actor has ever seemed so focused and so distracted at the same time. He thinks more than he says, and so we listen, trying to get the part he's leaving out." [ 122 ] Justin Chang of Variety described him as "one of the most persuasive leading men of his generation" [ 123 ] while Brogan Morris of Paste declared him "maybe Hollywood's best offbeat leading man ... Few actors can suggest so much with such quiet precision, and even here Affleck is compulsively watchable despite his undercooked character." [ 124 ] In Disney's disaster drama The Finest Hours , Affleck played a taciturn engineer on board a sinking ship. David Sims of The Atlantic said he "gives the kind of measured, thought-out performance he's so eminently capable of, even if the film isn't complex enough to rise to his level ... He animates an introverted character with subtle mental busywork whenever he's on the screen." [ 125 ] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter noted that he "manages to turn his man of few words into the movie's most compelling figure." [ 126 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In his final role of 2016, Affleck starred as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, in Kenneth Lonergan 's drama Manchester by the Sea . One of the film's producers, Matt Damon, initially intended to star in the film. When scheduling conflicts made this unfeasible, Damon agreed to step aside on the condition that he be replaced with Affleck. [ 127 ] Lonergan readily agreed, [ 128 ] remarking that Affleck was "the natural person to go to." [ 129 ] Affleck had close relationships with both men and had previously offered notes on early drafts of the script. [ 61 ] The film was a box office success, [ 130 ] and Affleck's performance received widespread critical praise. A.O. Scott of The New York Times described it as "one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory. [He] conveys both Lee's inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back." [ 131 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised his "quietly ferocious performance, his willingness to submerge himself into this character to an almost frightening extent." [ 132 ] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said the film was "anchored by a quietly volcanic central performance by Casey Affleck, in a breathtaking breakout role he's long deserved." [ 133 ] David Fear of Rolling Stone stated: "He's given impressive turns before [but] the way Affleck gradually shows you the man's bone-deep grief and emotional damage makes you believe that one of this generation's finest actors has simply been waiting to be coaxed out." [ 134 ] Affleck won the National Board of Review , Critics' Choice , Golden Globe , BAFTA , and Academy Award for his performance. [ ] [ ] [ ] After dropping out of Lowery's Pete's Dragon in order to star in Manchester by the Sea , [ 61 ] Affleck reteamed with the director to star opposite Rooney Mara in the experimental drama A Ghost Story , which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017. [ 135 ] Affleck's character dies suddenly at the outset and he spends much of the film covered by a white sheet with two eye-holes, haunting his former home. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said Affleck's performance managed to resonate despite limited time onscreen. [ 136 ] Peter Debruge of Variety said Affleck "has never been an easy actor to read. He's a low-charisma mumbler who tends to keep his characters' emotions bottled up, making him the rare performer who can convey as much with a sheet over his head as he does without." [ 137 ] Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian described him as "cinema's finest mumbler ... I can't even tell if he's speaking or just emitting high-pitched vibrations anymore." [ 138 ] In 2018, Affleck starred opposite Robert Redford in the outlaw drama The Old Man & the Gun , his third collaboration with Lowery. [ 139 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2019, he directed, wrote and starred in the survival drama Light of My Life . [ 140 ] [ 141 ] It had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 8, 2019 [ 142 ] and received positive reviews from film critics. [ 143 ] Affleck next starred in Our Friend , opposite Dakota Johnson and Jason Segel , directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite , based upon a true story revolving around a couple, whose best friend moves in for support, following a cancer diagnosis. [ 144 ] which had its world premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival . [ 145 ] Affleck next acted in and produced The World to Come , directed by Mona Fastvold alongside Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby . [ 146 ] In 2023, Affleck played the supporting role of military intelligence officer Boris Pash in Christopher Nolan 's biopic Oppenheimer . [ 147 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] Relationships and family [ edit ] [ edit ] Affleck was introduced to actress Summer Phoenix by her brother, Joaquin , in the late 1990s. [ 18 ] [ 148 ] They began dating in 2000, [ 149 ] and acted together in both the 2000 film Committed [ 150 ] and a 2002 stage production of This Is Our Youth . [ 151 ] The couple became engaged in January 2004 [ 148 ] and married on June 3, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia. [ 152 ] They have two sons born in 2004 and 2007. [ 153 ] On August 1, 2017, Phoenix officially filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences", [ 154 ] and it was finalized later that year. [ 155 ] Affleck has said it was an amicable divorce and that they remain friends. [ 23 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He has been in a relationship with actress Caylee Cowan since January 2021. [ 156 ] [ ] Alcoholism [ edit ] [ edit ] In a 2016 interview, Affleck said that he had been sober for "almost three years ... My father was a disaster of a drinker, my grandmother was an alcoholic, my brother spent some time in rehab – it's in our genes." [ 23 ] [ ] Political views [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2008, Affleck filmed an episode of documentary series 4Real , in which he visited the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma , and remarked upon the progress they had made due largely to "their own resourcefulness and determination and their character, and not because of the goodness of our collective heart." [ 157 ] During the 2016 presidential campaign , Affleck supported Hillary Clinton [ 33 ] [ 158 ] and characterized Donald Trump as "a dangerous fool". [ 61 ] [ 159 ] In 2017, multiple financial contributions to Trump were made by Affleck's production company, which he co-founded with John Powers Middleton . In a statement, Affleck denied involvement: "I had no knowledge of it, was never asked, and never would have authorized it ... The policies of the Trump administration, and the values they represent, are antithetical to everything I believe in." [ 160 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Sexual harassment allegations [ edit ] [ edit ] Affleck has settled two sexual harassment lawsuits out of court for an undisclosed amount. [ 161 ] [ ] In 2010, two of his former co-workers from I'm Still Here filed civil lawsuits against Affleck. Amanda White , one of the film's producers, sued Affleck for $2 million with multiple complaints including sexual harassment and breach of oral contract. [ 162 ] She detailed numerous "uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances" in the workplace. White alleged that Affleck refused to honor the terms of the production agreement, including her fee, in retaliation. [ 162 ] [ ] [ ] The film's cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, sued Affleck for $2.25 million with multiple complaints including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of oral contract. [ 163 ] [ 164 ] Gorka alleged that she had been subjected to "routine instances" of sexual harassment by crew members including Antony Langdon , "within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck." [ 163 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Initially, Affleck denied the allegations and threatened to countersue. [ 165 ] No countersuits were filed. [ 161 ] His lawyer claimed, "Both women left the film in April 2009 and both were refused when they wanted to return", and "there was no mention of sexual harassment before June [2010]." [ 166 ] The film's associate producer Nicole Acacio and an unnamed female editor both defended Affleck's conduct on set. [ 167 ] The lawsuits were later settled out of court. [ 168 ] Both women received credit for their work on the project; no details of any financial settlement were released. [ 169 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Affleck addressed the allegations in a 2016 interview with The New York Times , stating: "It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it. It was an unfortunate situation — mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved." [ 170 ] The allegations and lawsuits attracted scrutiny during the 2016–17 film awards season , when Affleck was recognized for his performance in Manchester by the Sea , which culminated in further controversy following his Best Actor win at the 89th Academy Awards . [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] The following year, amidst the Me Too movement , Affleck withdrew from presenting the award for Best Actress at the 90th Academy Awards . [ 174 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In a 2018 interview with the Associated Press, Affleck discussed the lawsuits and allegations in light of the Me Too movement. [ 175 ] He characterized his behavior at the time of the lawsuits as defensive and said he has since worked to understand his own culpability. [ 175 ] He remorsefully acknowledged that the set of I'm Still Here was "an unprofessional environment" and that "I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behavior from other people and I wish that I hadn't. And I regret a lot of that ... I behaved in a way and allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional. And I'm sorry." [ 175 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Philanthropy [ edit ] [ edit ] Affleck has been a vegan since 1995. [ 176 ] He has been involved with animal rights campaigns for both People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] and Farm Sanctuary . [ 180 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 2017, Affleck supported the 37th Annual National Veterans Wheelchair Games [ 181 ] hosted by Paralyzed Veterans of America . In January 2019, he attended the fourth annual Veterans Awards as a presenter. [ 182 ] [ ] [ ] In June 2020, Affleck, with his mother Christine, founded a fundraising effort, Stories from Tomorrow. The initiative was co-sponsored by Room to Read , WriteGirl and New Earth, an organization where Affleck is a board member. 'Stories from Tomorrow' matches original writing by children ages 5–18 with celebrities who read their work, which is then presented in video form. The money raised will be used to ensure that children around the world have access to education and food.

Bazelon (grandfather) Emily Bazelon (sister) Lara Bazelon (born February 14, 1974) is an American academic and journalist.  She is a law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law where she holds the Barnett Chair in Trial Advocacy and directs the Criminal & Juvenile and Racial Justice Clinics. [ 1 ] She is the former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent in Los Angeles. [ 2 ] Her clinical work as a law professor focuses on the exoneration of the wrongfully convicted. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] She is the author of two nonfiction books: Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction (Beacon Press 2018) [ 4 ] and Ambitious Like a Mother: Why Prioritizing Your Career is Good For Your Kids (Little Brown 2022), [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and the author of the novel A Good Mother (Hanover Sq. Press 2021). [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] Bazelon grew up in Philadelphia. Her father is an attorney and her mother is a psychiatrist. [ 9 ] [ ] She attended Germantown Friends School , [ 10 ] where she was on the tennis team.  She has three sisters: Emily Bazelon , an award-winning New York Times journalist and author; Jill Bazelon, who founded an organization that provides financial literacy classes free of charge to low income high school students and individuals; [ 11 ] and Dana Bazelon, senior policy counsel to Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner . [ 12 ] The Bazelon family are Jewish. [ 9 ] [ 13 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Bazelon is the granddaughter of David L. Bazelon , formerly a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , [ 14 ] and second cousin twice removed of feminist Betty Friedan . [ 15 ] [ ] [ ] Bazelon graduated cum laude from Columbia University in 1996, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and received her J.D. from NYU School of Law [ 18 ] where she was an editor of the NYU Law Review . Her note, Exploding the Superpredator Myth, [ 19 ] won the Paul D. Kaufman Memorial Award and was cited by Bryan Stevenson in his Supreme Court brief in Sullivan v. Florida , where he successfully argued that the Eighth Amendment forbade the sentencing of juveniles to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for crimes committed before the age of 13. [ 20 ] After law school Bazelon worked as a law clerk for the Honorable Harry Pregerson of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Academic career [ edit ] [ edit ] After seven years as a trial attorney in the Office of the Federal Public Defender in Los Angeles, Bazelon was awarded a clinical teaching fellowship at the UC Hastings College of the Law . [ 22 ] From 2012 to 2015, Bazelon was a visiting associate professor and the director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent in Los Angeles. [ 23 ] In 2017, Bazelon joined the faculty of the University of San Francisco School of Law as an associate professor and the director of the Criminal and Juvenile and Racial Justice Clinics. [ 24 ] In 2019, she was awarded tenure. [ 25 ] In 2020, she was awarded the Barnett Chair in Trial Advocacy. [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Exonerations [ edit ] [ edit ] While leading the Loyola Project for the Innocent, Bazelon was the lead counsel for Kash Register, who was exonerated on November 7, 2013, for a murder he did not commit after 34 years imprisonment. [ 27 ] Register won a $16.7 million judgment from the city and county of Los Angeles in 2016, the largest settlement in the history of Los Angeles. [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] From 2019 to 2021, Bazelon and her law students at the University of San Francisco School of Law represented Louisiana prisoner Yutico Briley Jr., who was sentenced to 60 years with no possibility of parole at the age of 19 for an armed robbery he did not commit. [ 29 ] The story of Briley's exoneration — and the collaboration of Lara and her sister Emily Bazelon in helping to bring it about — was the cover story of the New York Times Magazine in July 2021, written by Emily Bazelon. [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] Joaquin Ciria was freed after the San Francisco District Attorney's Innocence Commission, chaired by Bazelon, reinvestigated Ciria's case and recommended that the District Attorney seek to overturn his conviction. [ 31 ] San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brendon Conroy vacated Ciria's conviction on April 18, 2022, and he was released from jail on April 20, 2022, having serving 31 years in prison. [ 32 ] [ ] [ ] Bar complaints [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2018, Bazelon began filing bar complaints against prosecutors whom judges had found to have committed misconduct. But as Radley Balko wrote in the Washington Post , Bazelon met with no success: "none of the eight complaints resulted in significant disciplinary action." [ 33 ] Bazelon told the Washington Post she was particularly troubled by the case of Jamal Trulove, who was wrongfully convicted due to the misconduct of Assistant District Attorney Linda Allen. After the Court of Appeal overturned Trulove's conviction, Allen was allowed to retry him. [ 34 ] Following his acquittal, Trulove sued the city and county of San Francisco and received a $13.1 million judgment. [ 35 ] The State Bar of California took no action against Allen in response to Bazelon's complaint. [ 33 ] Represented by the law firm Jones Day , Bazelon took a writ to the California Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case by a vote of 5–1 with one justice recusing himself. [ 36 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Academic writing [ edit ] [ edit ] Bazelon's scholarship examining issues at the intersection of criminal justice and ethics as well as restorative justice as an alternative to incarceration, has been published in The Fordham Law Review , [ 37 ] the Hofstra Law Review , [ 38 ] the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics , [ 39 ] the Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law , [ 40 ] the Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law , [ 41 ] and the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology . [ 42 ] Bazelon is quoted frequently in national and local media as an expert on criminal justice issues. [ 43 ] She serves as a voting member of the ABA Criminal Justice Section's Council, the policymaking body for the organization on criminal justice issues. [ 44 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Journalism [ edit ] [ edit ] Bazelon writes regularly about criminal justice issues with a particular focus on how the legal system is affected by racism, sexism, and other biases. [ 45 ] She has written for The Atlantic about the gender bias female trial lawyers face [ 46 ] and how the felony murder rule disproportionately impacts women and people of color. [ 47 ] Her long running series on wrongful convictions has appeared in Slate since 2015 and her Innocence Deniers article was Slate's cover story in 2018. [ 48 ] A feminist and progressive Democrat, she also regularly draws criticism from the left for her critiques of other Democrats and progressive-leaning institutions.  Her New York Times op-ed "Kamala Harris Was Not A 'Progressive Prosecutor'" [ 49 ] sparked nationwide debate.  Assessing the impact of Bazelon's critique, Politico wrote, "after a prominent law professor tore apart her record in a New York Times op-ed," Harris faced "months of criticism of [her career] as a district attorney and state attorney general, thwarting her efforts to win over reform-minded liberals." [ 50 ] Bazelon has also drawn criticism for her support for the Title IX regulations promulgated by the Trump Administration, writing in another New York Times op-ed that they were necessary to provide due process protections for the accused [ 51 ] following a lengthier article published in Politico Magazine. [ 52 ] She and her students in the USF Racial Justice Clinic represent students of color accused of Title IX offenses who lack the means to hire an attorney. [ 53 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Bazelon's article in New York Magazine , "Did David Simon Glorify Baltimore's Detectives?" which examined the role of officers who became characters in The Wire in contributing to wrongful convictions, will be re-printed in the forthcoming anthology Unspeakable Acts: True Tales of Crime, Murder, Deceit and Obsession (Ecco 2023) edited by Sarah Weinman. [ 54 ] [ ] Bazelon's often contrarian positions have led to media appearances across the political spectrum including NPR, [ 55 ] MSNBC, [ 56 ] CNN, [ 57 ] Fox News, [ 58 ] and the popular podcasts Pod Save the People, [ 59 ] The Glenn Show, [ 60 ] The Fifth Column, [ 61 ] and The Unspeakable. [ 62 ] She is a founding member  of the Academic Freedom Alliance, a coalition of "college and university faculty members who are dedicated to upholding the principle of academic freedom." [ 63 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Personal essays [ edit ] [ edit ] A divorced mother of two, Bazelon writes frequently about her family. In 2015, The New York Times published Bazelon's essay, "From Divorce, a Fractured Beauty", as a Modern Love column. [ 64 ] The essay was also featured in the Modern Love podcast, read by the actress Molly Ringwald. [ 65 ] Bazelon's other personal essays in the New York Times include "Who Said Game of Thrones Wasn't For Kids", [ 66 ] "I Didn't Want Co-Sleeping to End", [ 67 ] and "I've Picked My Job Over My Kids" [ 68 ] which led to appearances on Good Morning America [ 69 ] and the Tamron Hall Show. [ 70 ] Her book, Ambitious Like A Mother: Why Prioritizing Your Career is Good for Your Kids , published in 2022, is an expansion on that thesis. [ 71 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Chesa Boudin [ edit ] [ edit ] Bazelon was an early supporter of Chesa Boudin 's campaign to become San Francisco District Attorney in 2019, and served as a member of his policy team. [ 72 ] In 2020, Boudin appointed Bazelon to chair his newly created Innocence Commission, a panel of five experts serving pro bono to re-investigate credible claims of wrongful conviction and transmit its findings to the DA. [ 73 ] In 2021, acting on the recommendation of the Innocence Commission, DA Boudin conceded that Joaquin Ciria, convicted of murder in San Francisco in 1991, was factually innocent. [ 74 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] During the campaign to recall Chesa Boudin, Bazelon was one of his most outspoken advocates. [ 75 ] Her defenses of Boudin were quoted in numerous media outlets including The New York Times, [ 76 ] The New Yorker, [ 77 ] The Atlantic, [ 78 ] and The San Francisco Chronicle. [ 79 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] Bazelon lives in San Francisco, California.  She and her ex-husband, attorney Matthew Dirkes, share custody of their two children. [ 80 ] [ ] Honors and awards [ edit ] [ edit ] In 2020, Bazelon was elected to the American Law Institute . [ 81 ] [ ] In 2017, Bazelon was a Langeloth Fellow and Mesa Fellow writer in residence. [ 82 ] [ ] In 2016, Bazelon was a MacDowell writer in residence. [ 83 ] [ ] References [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ "Lara Bazelon" . University of San Francisco School of Law .

Bender was a three-time All-Ivy League and two-time All-America in the early 1930s while attending Columbia University . After graduating from Columbia, Bender barnstormed with the Original Celtics and later played for a number of professional teams in the American Basketball League , the first true professional league and a predecessor of the National Basketball Association . [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] While a student at DeWitt Clinton High School in the late 1920s, Lou Bender connected on a long two-handed set shot during a game, prompting someone in the stands to shout, "Now that was a lulu of a basket." [ 1 ] The nickname stuck and followed Bender to college and the pros. At Columbia College from 1930 until 1932, Bender joined teammates George Gregory and Sam Schoenfeld to Ivy League titles in both 1930 and 1931, leading the league with scoring averages of 9.8 and 9.6 points per game those seasons, in an era before the shot clock in which ball control often limited scores to the teens. [ 1 ] He was named to All-Ivy, All-Met and All-American teams while playing for the Columbia Lions . [ 1 ] After completing his undergraduate degree in 1932, Bender earned his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1935. [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Rise of basketball [ edit ] [ edit ] While at Columbia, Mayor of New York Jimmy Walker organized a basketball tripleheader at Madison Square Garden in January 1931 to raise funds to benefit the city's unemployed during the Great Depression. In the three games, Manhattan College defeated New York University 16–14, St. John's University topped City College of New York by a score of 17–9 and Columbia beat Fordham University 26–18 with Bender's eight points topping the scoring charts. Attendance was excellent, with a record 15,000 fans attending the St. John's vs. CCNY game and the event raising $22,000 for relief. Over the next several years, Madison Square Garden became a destination for basketball play, with doubleheaders featuring teams from the local area and around the nation. [ 1 ] [ ] Professional play [ edit ] [ edit ] After finishing college, Bender barnstormed with the Original Celtics and played with American Basketball League teams such as the Union City Reds and the Boston Trojans , later finishing his professional career with the unaffiliated New York Whirlwinds . [ 1 ] [ ] In September 2008, Bender was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame along with NBA stars Kenny Anderson , Sam Perkins and Rod Strickland , coach Pete Gillen and pioneer Eddie Younger. [ 3 ] [ ] Legal career [ edit ] [ edit ] He became a trial lawyer following the completion of his playing career. During the 1940s, Bender was an Assistant United States Attorney in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , where his legal activities included prosecuting members of the German American Bund . He moved on to become a criminal defense attorney for five decades, lecturing on the subject and writing such texts as Criminal Aspects of Tax Fraud Cases . [ 2 ] [ ] Both of his sons followed their father into the legal profession. His son, Michael, has served as an associate justice of the Colorado Supreme Court , being appointed by Governor of Colorado to the post on January 2, 1997. Bender's son, Steven, has been a prosecutor in Westchester County, New York [ 2 ] [ ] Marriage [ edit ] [ edit ] He and his wife, the former Jean Waterman, were married in March 1934 at New York City Hall , and took a honeymoon cruise on the Staten Island Ferry for 5 cents each. [ 2 ] [ ] Death [ edit ] [ edit ] A resident of Harrison, New York , before moving to Florida, Lou Bender died from cancer , aged 99, on September 10, 2009, at his home in Longboat Key, Florida . He was survived by his wife of 75 years, Jean, as well as two daughters, two sons, 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Mrfoogles ( talk ) 21:44, 12 March 2025 (UTC)    ( edit | history ) Latest tech news from the Wikimedia technical community. Please tell other users about these changes. Not all changes will affect you. Translations are available. Updates for editors Wikifunctions is now integrated with Dagbani Wikipedia since April 15. It is the first project that will be able to call functions from Wikifunctions and integrate them in articles. A function is something that takes one or more inputs and transforms them into a desired output, such as adding up two numbers, converting miles into metres, calculating how much time has passed since an event, or declining a word into a case. Wikifunctions will allow users to do that through a simple call of a stable and global function , rather than via a local template. [1] A new type of lint error has been created: Empty headings ( documentation ). The Linter extension 's purpose is to identify wikitext patterns that must or can be fixed in pages and provide some guidance about what the problems are with those patterns and how to fix them. [2] View all 37 community-submitted tasks that were resolved last week .   Updates for technical contributors Following its publication on HuggingFace, the "Structured Contents" dataset, developed by Wikimedia Enterprise, is now also available on Kaggle . This Beta initiative is focused on making Wikimedia data more machine-readable for high-volume reusers. They are releasing this beta version in a location that open dataset communities already use, in order to seek feedback, to help improve the product for a future wider release. You can read more about the overall Structured Contents project , and about the first release that's freely usable . There is no new MediaWiki version this week. Meetings and events The Editing and Machine Learning Teams invite interested volunteers to a video meeting to discuss Peacock check , which is the latest Edit check that will detect "peacock" or "overly-promotional" or "non-neutral" language whilst an editor is typing. Editors who work with newcomers, or help to fix this kind of writing, or are interested in how we use artificial intelligence in our projects are encouraged to attend. The meeting will be on April 28, 2025 at 18:00–19:00 UTC and hosted on Zoom.

His debut novel , The White Tiger , won the 2008 Man Booker Prize . [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life and education [ edit ] [ edit ] Aravind Adiga was born in Madras (now Chennai ), the capital of Tamil Nadu , on 23 October 1974. His parents Usha Adiga and Dr. K. Madhava Adiga hailed from Mangalore , Karnataka . His paternal grandfather was K. Suryanarayana Adiga , former chairman of Karnataka Bank , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and maternal great-grandfather, U. Rama Rao , was a popular medical practitioner and politician from Madras. [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Adiga grew up in Mangalore and studied at Canara High School and later at St. Aloysius College, Mangaluru , where he completed his SSLC in 1990. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] After emigrating to Sydney with his family, Aravind studied at James Ruse Agricultural High School .  He later studied English literature at Columbia College of Columbia University , in New York City, under Simon Schama , and graduated as salutatorian in 1997. [ 11 ] He also studied at Magdalen College, Oxford , where one of his tutors was Hermione Lee . [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Journalism [ edit ] [ edit ] Aravind Adiga began his journalism career as an intern at the Financial Times . [ 12 ] With pieces published in Money and Time , he covered the stock market and investment. [ ] In 2003, he interviewed future US President Donald Trump . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Later that year, he moved from New York to New Delhi to be South Asia correspondent for Time . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In a 2017 interview, he explained: “Being a journalist afforded me a path to go back to India." [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Three years later, he became a freelance writer and moved to Mumbai . [ 12 ] [ ] His review of previous Booker Prize winner, Oscar and Lucinda , appeared in The Second Circle , an online literary review.

[ 20 ] Propelled mainly by the Booker Prize win, The White Tiger ' s Indian hardcover edition sold more than 200,000 copies. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] ' [ ] The book received critical acclaim. USA Today called it "one of the most powerful books I've read in decades", comparing it to Richard Wright's Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man . [ 22 ] The Washington Post called it: "[a] blistering description of the inner workings of India's corrupt upper class [...] fresh, funny, different." [ 23 ] [ ] [ ] Shortly after Adiga won the Booker Prize, it was alleged that he had sacked the agent who secured his contract with Atlantic Books at the 2007 London Book Fair . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Adiga denied this claim. [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In April 2009, it was announced that the novel would be adapted into a feature film , [ 27 ] which was later released on Netflix in 2021.

Barimo (born 1985) is a pop singer and whistler . Biography [ edit ] [ edit ] Raised in Winter Park, Florida , Barimo began his career as a singer and whistler as a child, performing with a boys' choir and touring as Amahl in Gian Carlo Menotti 's one-act opera Amahl and the Night Visitors . When he was three years old his aunt gave him a pet canary that supposedly inspired him to whistle. [ 1 ] In the first grade, Barimo was awarded "best whistler" of his class, foreshadowing what would come in his musical career. At the age of 11, Barimo appeared on the Nickelodeon show Figure It Out and whistled an aria from Faust. [ ] Barimo won several of the national whistling competitions held by the International Whistlers Convention in Louisburg, North Carolina as a teen. [ 2 ] Upon winning the grand title of World Champion at the Millennium Championship of Musical Whistling in Edmonton, Alberta in 1999, he began performing around the world, whistling operatic arias, particularly those with fast coloratura . His most well known whistled arias are: The Vengeance Aria ( Mozart ) The Jewel Song ( Gounod ) and Mercè Dilette Amiche ( Verdi ). [ ] Barimo attended Columbia College of Columbia University in New York City from 2002 to 2006, graduating with two B.A.'s in Italian Literature and Anthropology.
He won the 2002 Sergio Franchi scholarship from National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) and performed at galas in D.C. and Connecticut. On March 30, 2003, while a freshman at Columbia, Barimo appeared as the musical guest on the Late Show with David Letterman . [ 3 ] [ ] Barimo has performed at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall with the IBLA Foundation and was presented the Vincenzo Bellini award. [ 4 ] he was presented with an award by the Licia Albanese Puccini Foundation in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006 and performed at their annual gala held at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center . On November 30, 2007, Barimo performed a one-man concert for the Italian Legion of Merit. On November 11, 2008, he performed for Ten O'Clock Classics [ 5 ] at their gala at the Russian Tea Room in New York. In March 2008, he performed for the Ten O'Clock Classics at The Cutting Room in New York City. [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Barimo has been profiled in The New York Times, [ 7 ] America Oggi , [ 8 ] The Sydney Morning Herald , [ 9 ] National Geographic World, Sports Illustrated, The Winter Park Observerv, BBC News Online, [ 10 ] NYC24, [ 11 ] The Villages Daily Sun. [ 12 ] In summer 2007, Barimo modeled clothing for IO DONNA, the style magazine of Corriere dPeople from Winter Park, Floridaella Sera in an issue profiling 'Italiani d'America". [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] He can be heard on BBC 's animated series for children, 3rd & Bird :
"The colourful pre-school animation series, which features the bird-whistling talents of world musical whistling champion Michael Barimo, continues this week with a rollercoaster of an episode." [ 13 ] [ ] Now Barimo has a rock band, called Di Bari. Di Bari performs in festivals all over the US and has a following in Latin America.

Step 1: Choose your file   File: File: Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, mp3, mpeg, mpg, ogg, ogv, opus, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga, flac, wav, wave, webm, webp.            Step 2: Describe your file   Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia.   This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: "City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg". Bad : "Skyline.jpg", "DSC0001234.jpg".  Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for # < > [ ] | : { } / and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. "Sunset.jpg", "Townhall.jpg") Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. "John.jpg", "Miller.jpg") Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras ("DSC_001234", "IMGP0345"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web ("30996951316264l.jpg") Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . Example user A file of this name already exists on Commons! If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead.  A file of this name already exists. If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to:   No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead.   Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same.   Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about.   What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it.  wikilink Step 3: Provide source and copyright information   It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully.   This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. Thank you for offering to upload a free work.

For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1930 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the " URAA date ". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.)  Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for " non-free copyrighted works " below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason.

I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there. Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: The file will serve an important function in a particular article; ( NFCC8 ) It cannot be replaced by any other, free illustration that might yet be created; ( NFCC1 ) Its use does not negatively affect the commercial interests of its owner ( NFCC2 ) There will not be more non-free material used than necessary. ( NFCC3 ) This file will be used in the following article: Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the "http://en.wikipedia.org/..." URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually. Example – article okay. This article doesn't exist! The article Example could not be found. Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards. This is not an actual encyclopedia article! The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that. This is a disambiguation page! The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. Non-free use rationale This image is the object of discussion in an article. This is a copyrighted artwork or photograph, and the image itself is the topic of discussion in the article.

(It is not just about the person or thing shown in the picture.) There is a substantial amount of encyclopedic discussion of this particular photograph/painting ( not just about the person or thing shown in it) in this article. The illustration is specifically needed to support the following point: If neither of these two statements applies, then please do not upload this image. This section is not for images used merely to illustrate an article about a person or thing, showing what that person or thing look like. This is a depiction of a copyrighted three-dimensional work or building , which is the object of discussion in an article.

He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals . Biography [ edit ] [ edit ] Bartlett was born in Uxbridge, Massachusetts , the son of William Osborne Bartlett and Agnes E. H. Willard. His brother was Congressman Franklin Bartlett . He attended Columbia College , graduating with a B.A. While there, he was a member of the Fraternity of Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall ). [ 1 ] He then received a LL.B. from New York University in 1868. He practiced law in partnership with Elihu Root from 1869 until his election to the bench. [ ] On October 26, 1870, he married Mary Fairbanks Buffum. From 1871 to 1873, he was a drama critic for the old New York Sun , and later wrote editorials on legal topics and book reviews for this paper. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (2nd D.) from 1884 to 1907. From 1887 on, he sat on the General Term (First Dept.) and, after the re-organization of the court system by the State Constitution of 1894, on the Appellate Division, 2nd Dept. from 1896 to 1907. In January 1906, he was designated to the Court of Appeals under the Amendment of 1899. In November 1907 , he was elected on the Republican and Democratic tickets to a 14-year term as judge of the New York Court of Appeals , and was Chief Judge from 1914 to 1916, elected in November 1913 on the Democratic ticket. He retired from the bench when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years, and resumed his law practice with Elihu Root . He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1918. [ 2 ] [ ] Bartlett died in Brooklyn , New York aged 78. He was buried at the Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn .

[ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1991, Bendinger directed a music video for Queen Latifah 's song "Fly Girl." [ 4 ] The video was nominated for a Billboard Music Award .

Along with John Marshall and Robert Gardner , Asch played an important role in the development of visual anthropology . [ 1 ] He is particularly known for his film The Ax Fight and his role with the USC Center for Visual Anthropology . [ ] Background [ edit ] [ edit ] Asch was born in Southampton, New York and attended The Putney School .  He studied at Columbia University , where he received his B.S. in anthropology in 1959.  While at Columbia, he served as a teaching assistant for Margaret Mead , who encouraged his work in visual anthropology . [ 2 ] From 1950 to 1951, he served apprenticeships with Minor White , Edward Weston and Ansel Adams through the San Francisco Art Institute (formerly known as the California School of Fine Arts). [ 3 ] He received his M.A. in African Studies from Boston University (with an anthropology concentration at Harvard University ) in 1964. [ ] [ ] Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Asch was known for his work as an ethnographic filmmaker on the Yanomami in conjunction with Napoleon Chagnon . He also worked in Indonesia with anthropologists Linda Connor , James J. Fox and E. Douglas Lewis . In 1968, Asch and John Marshall co-founded Documentary Educational Resources (DER), a non-profit organization whose mission is to support, produce, and distribute ethnographic, non-fiction, and documentary films. Asch's film work continues to be distributed through DER. Asch taught at New York University , Brandeis University , and Harvard University , and was a Research Fellow at the Australian National University prior to joining the University of Southern California (USC) in 1982. He became the Director of the Center for Visual Anthropology after the death of founder Barbara Myerhoff .  During his period at USC, he was involved with the Margaret Mead Film Festival . Asch acted as Director of the Center for Visual Anthropology up until his death from cancer on October 3, 1994. [1] The Spring 1995 issue of Visual Anthropology Review (Vol. 11, No.1) was dedicated to Asch. [2] [ permanent dead link ] [ permanent dead link ] permanent dead link Filmography [ edit ] [ edit ] Asch was a prolific filmmaker with an extensive list of more than 70 films to his credit. [ 4 ] Over 40 of these are short films on the Yanomami in collaboration with Napoleon Chagnon . [ ] Asch made most of his films for educational classroom use. He often showed his films to students and edited them based on student feedback. In one semester, Asch edited The Ax Fight up to twenty five times to make it more understandable and ideal for teaching. He was also a proponent of using film as a research and archive tool. Marriage and family [ edit ] [ edit ] Asch married Patricia Wood.  Together they acted as partners with other anthropologists in Afghanistan and Indonesia to produce films widely used in education and research.  They had four children: two daughters, Caya and Kim (who was adopted from South Korea) and sons Gregory (also known as DJ Olive ) and Alexander.

He is known for his actions during the Invasion of Quebec in 1775–76. Background and early years [ edit ] [ edit ] Antill was born on April 11, 1742, in Piscataway ("Piscataqua"), Province of New Jersey . [ 1 ] He was the fourth of six children born to Edward Antill (1701–1770), a colonial plantation owner, attorney, and early politician in New Jersey, and Anne Morris (1706–1781). His maternal grandfather was Lewis Morris (1671–1746), Royal Governor of New Jersey, [ 2 ] and his paternal grandfather was Edward Antill ( c. 1659–1725), an English-born merchant and attorney. [ ] [ ] In 1762, Antill graduated from King's College (now Columbia University ) in New York City. [ 2 ] [ ] On May 4, 1767, Antill married Charlotte Riverin of Quebec City . They had six children. Antill was a member and Past Master of St. John’s Masonic Lodge . [ 3 ] He was active in Freemasonry, having served as the first Deputy Grand Master for the District of Montreal, having been appointed to that office in 1767 by the Provincial Grand Lodge of Quebec. [ ] Military career [ edit ] [ edit ] Antill was an American colonist living in the city of Quebec when in 1775 he joined the 2nd Canadian Regiment (also known as Congress' Own Regiment), as an engineer. He participated in the Battle of Quebec under General Richard Montgomery , and was present when Montgomery died from wounds received in the battle on December 31, 1775. [ 2 ] [ ] After the failed attack on Quebec, Antill was sent to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia . [ 2 ] [ ] In August 1777, Antill was taken prisoner at the second Battle of Staten Island , so he was not with his regiment at the Battle of Brandywine . He remained on a prison ship on the Hudson River for three years. Upon his release, he followed and rejoined the 2nd Canadian Regiment at Yorktown . [ 2 ] [ ] Later years and death [ edit ] [ edit ] After the Revolutionary War , Antill soon fell upon hard times, and he suffered a breakdown after the death of his wife Charlotte in 1785. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1787, he left his youngest child, two-year-old Frances (Fanny) Antill, in the care of Alexander Hamilton (who was then a lawyer in New York City ) and his wife Elizabeth : [ ] [ ] Colonel Antil  [ sic ] of the Canadian Corps, a friend of General Hazen , retired penniless from the service—his military claims, a sole dependence, being unsatisfied. Hoping to derive subsistence from the culture of a small clearing in the forest, he retired to the wilds of Hazenburgh . His hopes were baffled, and in his distress he applied to Hamilton for relief. His calamities were soon after embittered by the loss of his wife, leaving infant children. With one of these Antil visited New York, to solicit the aid of the Cincinnati , and there sank under the weight of his sorrows. Hamilton immediately took the little orphan home, who was nurtured with his own children... [ 4 ] [ ] Two years later, on May 23, 1789, Antill died in Canada at Saint-Jean , near Montréal . Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until she was twelve, at which time her older sister Mary was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. [ 5 ] Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny "was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter." [ 5 ] She later married Arthur Tappan , a prosperous merchant and abolitionist . [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] References [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ Schuyler, John (1886).

[ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early life [ edit ] [ edit ] Felix Adler was born in Alzey , Rhenish Hesse , Grand Duchy of Hesse , Germany , the son of a rabbi, Samuel Adler , a leading figure in European Reform Judaism , and Henrietta Frankfurter. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The family immigrated to the United States from Germany when Felix was six years old so that his father could accept the appointment as head rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in New York. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Adler attended Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School and graduated from Columbia University in 1870 with honors. [ 5 ] [ 8 ] He continued at Heidelberg University where he studied as part of his training to become a rabbi. He received a PhD from Heidelberg in 1873. [ 9 ] While in Germany, he was strongly influenced by neo-Kantianism , especially the notions that one cannot prove or disprove the existence of a deity or immortality, and that morality can be established independently of theology . [ ] [ ] [ ] Academic career [ edit ] [ edit ] When Adler returned to New York at the age of twenty-three, he was asked to give a sermon at Temple Emanu-El, where he was meant to follow in his father's footsteps as rabbi of the congregation. His sermon, "The Judaism of the Future", shocked the congregation, as he did not once mention God .  Adler introduced his concept of Judaism as a universal religion of morality for all of humankind.  The sermon was his first and last at Temple Emanu-El. [ 7 ] [ ] In 1874, after it had become clear that he would not become a rabbi, members of his father's congregation helped Adler gain a teaching position at Cornell University as a nonresident Professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature. [ 5 ] He was popular with his students, with whom he discussed his novel religious ideas while illuminating contemporary labor struggles and power politics. He was attacked as an atheist for his views, and in 1876 Cornell declined to accept the grant that had paid Adler's salary. [ 7 ] In 1902 Adler was given the chair of political and social ethics at Columbia University, where he taught until his death in 1933. There he opposed the formation of a Zionist student club, considering it to be a "divisive force". [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] New York Society of Ethical Culture [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1876, Adler, at age 26, was invited to give a lecture expanding upon his themes first presented in the sermon at Temple Emanu-El. On May 15, 1876, he reiterated the need for a religion that united all humankind in moral and social action without the trappings of ritual or creed. [ 11 ] To do away with theology and to unite theists , atheists , agnostics and deists , all in the same religious cause, was a revolutionary idea at the time. A few weeks after the sermon, Adler started a series of weekly Sunday lectures. In February 1877, aided by Joseph Seligman , president of Temple Emanu-El, Adler incorporated the Society of Ethical Culture. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] Adler talked about "deed, not creed"; he believed good works were the basis of ethical culture. In 1877, the Society founded the District Nursing Department, which organized a team of nurses who visited the homebound sick in poor districts. [ 7 ] A year later, in 1878, the Society established a free kindergarten for working people's children. Because it served the working poor, the kindergarten provided basic necessities for the children when needed, such as clothing and hot meals. [ 12 ] It evolved into the Ethical Culture Fieldston School . [ ] [ ] Well-known as a lecturer and writer, Adler served as a rector for the Ethical Culture School until his death in 1933. Throughout his life, he always looked beyond the immediate concerns of family, labor, and race to the long-term challenge of reconstructing institutions, such as schools and government, to promote greater justice in human relations. Cooperation rather than competition was the higher social value. He gave a series of six lectures on "The Ethics of Marriage" for the Lowell Institute 's 1896–1897 season. Adler was the founding chairman of the National Child Labor Committee in 1904. Lewis Hine was hired as the committee's photographer in 1908. In 1917, Adler served on the Civil Liberties Bureau, which later became the American Civil Liberties Bureau and then the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In 1928, he became president of the Eastern division of the American Philosophical Association . He served on the first executive board of the National Urban League . Tenement house reform [ edit ] [ edit ] As a member of the New York State Tenement House Commission, Adler was concerned not only with overcrowding but also by the increase in contagious disease caused by overcrowding. Though not a proponent of free public housing, Adler spoke out about tenement reform and the rents, which he considered exorbitant. Jacob Riis wrote that Adler had "clear incisive questions that went through all subterfuges to the root of things." In 1885 Adler and others created the Tenement House Building Company in order to build "model" affordable tenements; they rented for $8–$14/month. By 1887 the company had completed six model buildings on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for the sum of $155,000. Critics favored legislation and regulations to improve tenement conditions, but the model tenement was a progressive step. American foreign policy [ edit ] [ edit ] By the late 1890s, with the increase in international conflicts, Adler switched his concern from domestic issues to the question of American foreign policy. While some contemporaries viewed the 1898 Spanish–American War as an act to liberate the Cubans from Spanish rule, others perceived the U.S. victories in the Caribbean and the Philippines as the beginning of an expansionist empire . Adler at first supported the war but later expressed concern about American sovereignty over the Philippines and Puerto Rico .  He believed that an imperialistic rather than a democratic goal was guiding U.S. foreign policy . Ethical Culture affirms "the supreme worth of the person", and Adler superimposed this tenet on international relations, believing that no single group could lay claim to superior institutions and lifestyle. Unlike many of his contemporaries during World War I , Adler did not believe that the defeat of the German Empire would make the world safe for democracy. He thought peace depended on representative democratic governments being non-imperialistic and their curbing the arms race . He opposed the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations . As an alternative, Adler proposed a "Parliament of Parliaments", elected by the legislative bodies of the different nations and representing  different classes of people, rather than special interests, so that common interests would prevail over national differences. Philosophy [ edit ] [ edit ] Adler developed an original philosophy with a foundation in those of Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that developed and transformed these roots. He considered philosophy not just a guide of life but a key to improving society and the human condition appropriate to respect for essential human dignity. Rejecting Kant's metaphysics, he embraced his stress on the intrinsic worth and dignity of the person. Combining a supreme moral principle similar to Kant's with his detailed ideas of self-realization, he emphasized the free development of the individual about societal concerns and fellowship. He preceded John Dewey in a concern for the "problems of men" instead of philosophical technicalities. While his ideas shared some aspects of pragmatism , he was better described as "an ethical idealist with great practical reforming zeal" he promoted an idealist version of moral perfectionism . He was, however, realistic and not sentimental, acknowledging that man has done evil knowingly and deliberately. [ 9 ] [ ] Adler's ethics combined an appeal to universal principles with moral particularism , which holds that the unique circumstances of a particular case must be carefully considered to determine the ethical choice in that case. Adler believed that moral laws could not be applied similarly to varied and unique individuals but that moral principles applied to all. He saw a need to balance essential general principles with consideration of the particular specific circumstances. He developed his own version of what he called Kant's "formula," which was, "Treat every [person] as a spiritual means to thine own spiritual end and conversely." [ 9 ] [ ] He proposed a "supreme ethical rule," which he stated as follows: "So act as to elicit the unique personality in others, and thereby in thyself," or "Act so as to elicit the best in others and thereby in thyself." He thought by doing so, one would transcend both egoism and altruism . He believed that virtue is and must be its reward, or else it is not. He characterized a virtuous act as one "in which the ends of self and of the other are respected and promoted jointly," coordinating Kantian universalistic imperative ethics with a type of perfectionism. He took ethics seriously and felt it "must run like a golden thread through the whole of a [person's] life." He felt consequentialism , particularly utilitarianism , was inappropriate in ethics as it attempts to apply quantitative measures to something of a qualitative nature. [ 9 ] [ ] Adler's social philosophy opposed commercialism . He claimed, "The root disease that afflicts the world at the present day is the supremacy of the commercial point of view." [ 9 ] His thought prized public works and the use of reason to develop ultimate ethical standards. Adler published such works as Creed and Deed (1878), Moral Instruction of Children (1892), Life and Destiny (1905), The Religion of Duty (1906), Essentials of Spirituality (1908), An Ethical Philosophy of Life (1918), The Reconstruction of the Spiritual Ideal (1925), and Our Part in this World. He made use of ideas from Judaism, as well as the philosophies of Kant and Ralph Waldo Emerson , mixed with specific socialist ideas of his time. He believed that the concept of a personal god was unnecessary and thought that the human personality was the central force of religion.  He believed that different people's interpretations of religions were to be respected as religious in themselves. The Ethical Culture movement was open to people of diverse beliefs. Ethical Culture societies were formed in the late nineteenth century in numerous cities in the United States, for instance, Philadelphia and St. Louis.

[ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Antonelli later apologized, and Gerrold accepted the apology, saying "Let's put this one to bed, once and for all. Lou Antonelli did something dumb. People were outraged. Someone who cared about him held up a mirror and he recognized he was (in his words) turning into his own crazy uncle. He apologized. I'm satisfied that his apology was sincere. And that should be the end of it." [ 11 ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] He was married to Patricia (Randolph) Antonelli, a Dallas native. Antonelli died suddenly at the age of 64 at his residence in Clarksville, Texas .

Born on June 30, 1935, and raised in Brooklyn , he attended Columbia University , studying music and philosophy. [ 1 ] While serving at Fort Bliss in El Paso County, Texas while in the United States Army for two years, he hosted a local radio show and organized a jazz festival. [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] While in his late-20s, Berniker produced Barbra Streisand 's first three albums — The Barbra Streisand Album (that year's Grammy winner for Album of the Year ), The Second Barbra Streisand Album and The Third Album — all of which were released six months apart in the one-year span from February 1963 to February 1964, and which were described by The New York Times as "among the most expressively uninhibited" of her career. [ 2 ] Berniker also produced Streisand's classic career-making single " People ", her first Top 10 single. He produced several Broadway albums, including his work with composer Cy Coleman on The Will Rogers Follies , which won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album at the 1992 ceremonies . He won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the Grammy Awards of 1986 for his work as producer of the original Broadway cast album for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom . [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] As an executive with RCA Records , Berniker signed Daryl Hall and John Oates and Juice Newton . [ 2 ] [ ] Berniker lived with his wife Heather in Fort Lee, New Jersey from the mid-1970s until 2002, when they moved to Hillsdale, New York . He died on July 25, 2008, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts of complications from kidney disease. [ 3 ] [ ] References [ edit ] [ edit ] ^ "Obituaries" . Columbia College Today . December 2008 .

( April 2024 ) April 2024 ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Arledge in 1978  Roone Pinckney Arledge Jr. ( 1931-07-08 ) July 8, 1931 Queens , New York ,  U.S. ( 1931-07-08 ) 1931-07-08 December 5, 2002 (2002-12-05) (aged 71) New York City , U.S. (2002-12-05) Sacred Hearts of Jesus & Mary R.C. Cemetery, Southampton, New York Columbia University (BA) Roone Pinckney Arledge Jr. (July 8, 1931 – December 5, 2002) was an American sports and news broadcasting executive who was president of ABC Sports from 1968 until 1986 and ABC News from 1977 until 1998, and a key part of the company's rise to competition with the two other main television networks, NBC and CBS , in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s.  He created many programs still airing today, such as Monday Night Football , ABC World News Tonight , Nightline and 20/20 . Early life [ edit ] [ edit ] Arledge was born in Forest Hills, Queens , New York City, the son of Gertrude (Stritmater) and Roone Pinckney Arledge, an attorney. [ 1 ] Arledge grew up in Merrick [ 2 ] and attended Wellington C. Mepham High School on Long Island where he wrestled and played baseball. Although Arledge was not a stand out wrestler, Mepham was the most premier wrestling school in the country at the time. [ ] [ ] Upon graduation, he decided that sportswriting was what he wanted to do in life, and applied to Columbia University . There, he discovered that Columbia's journalism program was a graduate program, not an undergraduate one.  Even so, Arledge liked what he saw and enrolled in a liberal-arts program. He also served as President of the Omega chapter of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta .  His classmates included Max Frankel , who would eventually win a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for his work as editorial page editor of the New York Times ; Larry Grossman , who became president of the Public Broadcasting Service in 1976 and later went on to head NBC News; and Richard Wald , another president of NBC News that Arledge would later persuade to come over to ABC News as a senior vice-president. He was the only one of the four who did not work at the Columbia Daily Spectator , the daily student newspaper of Columbia University. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1952, Arledge enrolled in graduate studies at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs .  Restless with graduate studies, he went looking for a job where he could use his college degree and obtained an entry-level job at the DuMont Television Network .  Military service intervened, and after Arledge's discharge, he learned the network had folded and he had no job to return to. Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] Arledge was married three times. He wed Gigi Shaw in 1994. He is survived by her and his four children from his first marriage, Roone, Elizabeth, Susan Weston and Patricia Loonie. His previous spouses were Joan Heise and Ann Fowler. Career [ edit ] [ edit ] Contacts he made at DuMont paid off with a stage manager's job at NBC's New York City station, WRCA (later WNBC ).  One of his assignments there was to help produce a children's puppet show hosted by Shari Lewis .  In 1958, the program won a New York City Emmy award . Even with that success, Arledge wanted to tinker with programming ideas.  Using the avant-garde magazine Playboy as his model, Arledge convinced his superiors at WRCA to let him film a pilot of a show he called For Men Only .  While his superiors liked the pilot, they told him WRCA could not find a place in the programming schedule for it.  But the WRCA weatherman, Pat Hernon, who hosted the pilot episode of For Men Only , began showing the kinescope to people around New York City who might want the program.  One of them was a former account executive at the ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample , Edgar J. Scherick , who as far as Hernon knew, was doing something at ABC. Assistant Producer [ edit ] [ edit ]   This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( June 2019 ) June 2019 ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Scherick had joined the fledgling ABC television network when he persuaded it to purchase Sports Programs, Inc.  Scherick had formed this company after leaving CBS when the network would not make him the head of sports programming, choosing instead Bill MacPhail , a former baseball public-relations agent.  Before ABC Sports even became a formal division of the network, Scherick and ABC programming chief Tom Moore pulled off many programming deals involving the most popular American sporting events. While Scherick wasn't interested in "For Men Only," he recognized the talent Arledge had.  Arledge realized ABC was the organization he was looking to join.  The lack of a formal organization would offer him the opportunity to claim real power when the network matured.  So, he signed on with Scherick as an assistant producer. Several months before ABC began broadcasting NCAA college football games, Arledge sent Scherick a remarkable memo, filled with youthful exuberance, and television production concepts which sports broadcasts have adhered to since. [ citation needed ] Previously, network sporting broadcasts had consisted of simple set-ups and focused on the game itself.  The genius of Arledge in this memo was not that he offered another way to broadcast the game to the sports fan.  Arledge recognized television had to take the sports fan to the game.  In addition, Arledge realized that the broadcasts needed to attract, and hold the attention of women viewers.  At age 29 on September 17, 1960, he put his vision into reality with ABC's first NCAA college football broadcast from Birmingham, Alabama, between Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs won by Alabama, 21–6.  That same year, ABC began broadcasting games in the fledgling American Football League and used the same innovative techniques in their broadcasts.  Sports broadcasting has not been the same since. [ citation needed ] citation needed citation needed ABC Sports [ edit ] [ edit ] Despite the production values he brought to NCAA college football, Scherick wanted low-budget (as in inexpensive broadcasting rights) sports programming that could attract and retain an audience.  He hit upon the idea of broadcasting track and field events sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union .  While Americans were not exactly fans of track and field events, Scherick figured Americans understood games. So in January 1961, Scherick called Arledge into his office and asked him to attend the annual AAU board of governors meeting.  While he was shaking hands, Scherick said, if the mood seemed right, might he cut a deal to broadcast AAU events on ABC?  It seemed a tall assignment, but as Scherick said years later, "Roone was a gentile and I was not."  Arledge came back with a deal for ABC to broadcast all AAU events for $50,000 a year. Next, Scherick and Arledge divided up their NCAA college football sponsor list.  They then telephoned their sponsors and said in so many words, "Advertise on our new sports show coming up in April, or forget about buying commercials on NCAA college football this fall."  The two persuaded enough sponsors to advertise, though it took them to the last day of a deadline imposed by ABC programming to do it. Wide World of Sports suited Scherick's plans exactly.  By exploiting the speed of jet transportation and flexibility of videotape, Scherick was able to undercut NBC and CBS's advantages in broadcasting live sporting events.  In that era, with communications nowhere near as universal as they are today, ABC was able to safely record events on videotape for later broadcast without worrying about an audience finding out the results. Arledge, his colleague Chuck Howard , and Jim McKay (who left CBS for this opportunity) made up the show on a week-by-week basis the first year it was broadcast.  Arledge had a genius for the dramatic storyline that unfolded in the course of a game or event.  McKay's honest curiosity and reporter's bluntness gave the show an emotional appeal that attracted viewers who might not otherwise watch a sporting event. But more importantly from Arledge's perspective, Wide World of Sports allowed him to demonstrate his ability as an administrator as well as producer.  Arledge did not gain a formal title as president of ABC Sports until 1968, even though Scherick left his position to assume a position of vice president for programming at ABC in 1964. Arledge personally produced all ten ABC Olympic broadcasts, created the primetime Monday Night Football , [ citation needed ] and is said to have coined ABC's famous "The thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat" tagline [ citation needed ] — although ABC insiders of that era attribute the authorship to legendary sports broadcaster Jim McKay . He also presided as producer over the 1975 flop, Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell , which director Don Mischer blamed on Arledge's inexperience with the variety show genre and indifference to the work required. [ 3 ] citation needed citation needed [ ] ABC News [ edit ] [ edit ] Arledge took over as President of ABC  News during a time that had  been characterized by  blunders such as the disastrous pairing of Barbara Walters with Harry Reasoner at the desk of the network's evening news. The previous year, ABC had lured Walters away from NBC's Today Show for $1,000,000. Previous to that time, the only news experience Arledge had was providing ABC's coverage of the tragedies during the '72 Olympics in Munich. Other than that, he had no other major experience in news. Arledge's first major creation for ABC was 20/20, which premiered in June 1978. The first iteration of this program fared badly, and resulted in the firing of the original hosts, with Hugh Downs chosen as the new anchor beginning the second week of the program, with the above-mentioned Barbara Walters joining Downs the following year, eventually becoming Downs' co-anchor by 1981. Shortly thereafter, Arledge reformatted the network's evening newscast with many of the splashy graphics he had developed at Wide World of Sports, and created World News Tonight. The program was unique not only because it was anchored by three newsmen, but because each of them was located in separate cities. The lead anchor became Frank Reynolds , who was based in Washington, with Max Robinson based out of Chicago, and Peter Jennings reporting from London. The program expanded to Sundays in 1979 and Saturdays in 1985. In 1983, Reynolds died of bone cancer, and Robinson departed the network, and ABC made Jennings the sole anchor of World News Tonight on September 5, 1983. Jennings anchored the broadcast until April 5, 2005, when he announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, to which Jennings would succumb on August 7, 2005. In 1979, the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran was taken over by Iranian students, creating the Iranian Hostage Crisis . And on November 4, 1979, Frank Reynolds began anchoring a series of special reports entitled America Held Hostage . Several nights later, Ted Koppel , then the network's diplomatic correspondent to the U.S. State Department, took over as anchor. The special reports led to the creation of Nightline , which premiered on March 24, 1980. Koppel anchored the broadcast with Chris Bury , and served as its managing editor. Koppel retained the position until his retirement in November 2005. In 1981, Arledge brought David Brinkley to ABC from NBC, and created the Sunday-morning affairs program This Week for Brinkley. Brinkley would retire from the program in 1996. The last major news program created during Arledge's reign at ABC News was Primetime Live , in 1989. The program was originally anchored by Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer. In 1986, Arledge stepped down as president of ABC Sports. That same year, ABC's World News Tonight began a ten-year domination of the network news ratings. In 1998, Arledge retired from ABC News. Arledge died on December 5, 2002, in New York City, New York, at the age of 71, following a battle with prostate cancer. He was buried in Southampton Cemetery. His autobiography, Roone: A Memoir , was published posthumously in 2003. United States Championship Tournament scandal [ edit ] [ edit ] In 1976, managing editor of The Ring , Johnny Ort fabricated records of selected boxers, to elevate them, thereby securing them lucrative fights in the United States Championship Tournament, which was promoted by Don King and sponsored by ABC Sports. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The scandal was uncovered by boxing writer Malcolm "Flash" Gordon and ABC staffer Alex Wallau . After Gordon and Wallau's evidence was presented to  Arledge the United States Championship tournament was cancelled. The scandal would lead to the eventual resignation of New York State Boxing Commissioner James A. Farley Jr. , who had lent his name to the Championship fights. [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 20/20 criticism  [ edit ] [ edit ] Scandal would erupt around Arledge again in 1985 from a decision by Arledge, president of ABC News and Sports, to kill a 13-minute report about Marilyn Monroe possibly due to his close ties to Ethel Kennedy . 20/20 drew criticism from the co-anchors of the program, Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters, and the executive producer, Av Westin.  Arledge said that he had killed the piece because it was "gossip-column stuff" and "does not live up to its billing." Downs, however, took issue with Arledge's judgment. "I am upset about the way it was handled," he said in an interview. "I honestly believe that this is more carefully documented than anything any network did during Watergate. I lament the fact that the decision reflects badly on people I respect and it reflects badly on me and the broadcast." [ 6 ] Additionally, Westin said: "I don't anticipate not putting it on the air. The journalism is solid. Everything in there has two sources. We are documenting that there was a relationship between Bobby and Marilyn and Jack and Marilyn. A variety of eyewitnesses attest to that on camera." Two other aspects of the unaired report, according to an ABC staff member who has seen it, are eyewitness accounts of wiretapping of Miss Monroe's home by Jimmy Hoffa , the Teamster leader, that reveal meetings between her and the Kennedy brothers, and accounts of a visit to Monroe by Robert F. Kennedy on the day of her death. Fred Otash, a detective who says he was the chief wiretapper, is interviewed on camera, and ABC staff members said his account was corroborated by three other wiretappers. In addition, several people not in the book say on camera that Monroe kept diaries with references to meetings with the Kennedy brothers, according to a staff member who has seen the report. "It set out to be a piece which would demonstrate that because of alleged relations between Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe the Presidency was compromised because organized crime was involved," he said. "Based on what has been uncovered so far, there was no evidence." [ 6 ] Arledge's decision to kill the broadcast resulted in the subsequent decision of Geraldo Rivera to leave ABC entirely. Rivera was a 20/20 correspondent but did not work on that story. He had been publicly critical of Arledge's decision. Arledge, who has been both a champion and defender of Rivera, has said he thought the story needed more work. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Honors [ edit ] [ edit ] Arledge was selected by Life magazine as one of the "100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century". Sports Illustrated ranked him number three in a list of "the 40 individuals who have most significantly altered or elevated the world of sports in the last four decades". The NATPE "Man of the Year" Iris Award was presented to him in 1971. In 1981, he was a recipient of the Silver Olympic Order . [ 8 ] [ ] He was the winner of 37 Emmy Awards and in 1990 was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame .  In 2001, he was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame .  In 2007, The Walt Disney Company posthumously named Arledge a Disney Legend for his contributions to ABC News and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC), both (along with the ABC Network) now owned by Disney. [ 9 ] [ ] The Roone Arledge auditorium located in student center Alfred Lerner Hall of Columbia University , Arledge's Alma Mater, is named in his honor. In 1997, Arledge won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism . [ 10 ] [ ] Arledge was portrayed by John Heard in the 2002 TNT movie Monday Night Mayhem . [ 11 ] In the 2024 film September 5 , about ABC's coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympics, Arledge was portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard . [ ] General sources [ edit ] [ edit ] Arledge, Roone (2003). Roone .

His wife, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor , served as the leader of New York society's " Four Hundred " during the Gilded Age . [ ] Early years [ edit ] [ edit ] William Backhouse Astor Jr. was born on July 12, 1829, in New York City, New York. He was the middle son of real estate businessman William Backhouse Astor Sr. (1792–1875) and Margaret Rebecca ( née Armstrong) Astor (1800–1872).  His siblings included elder brother John Jacob Astor III , who married Charlotte Augusta Gibbes; [ a ] Emily Astor, who married Samuel Cutler Ward ; [ b ] Laura Eugenia Astor, who married Franklin Hughes Delano ; [ c ] Mary Alida Astor, who married John Carey; Henry Astor, who married Malvina Dinehart; [ 5 ] and Sarah Astor, who died in infancy. [ citation needed ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] citation needed Astor's paternal grandparents were fur-trader John Jacob Astor and Sarah Cox (née Todd) Astor. [ 6 ] His maternal grandparents were U.S. Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida (née Livingston) Armstrong of the Livingston family . [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] A well-liked man, Astor graduated from Columbia College in 1849. He was a member of Columbia's Philolexian Society . [ 7 ] [ ] Subsequent activity [ edit ] [ edit ] He supported the abolition of slavery before the American Civil War , and during the war, he personally bore the cost to equip an entire Union Army regiment. [ citation needed ] citation needed Unlike his business-oriented father, William Jr. did not aggressively pursue an expansion of his inherited fortune. Instead, he preferred life aboard the Ambassadress , at that time the biggest private yacht in the world, or horseback riding at Ferncliff , the large estate he had built on the Hudson River . Astor's horse Vagrant won the second running of the Kentucky Derby , in 1876. [ 8 ] [ ] Florida involvement [ edit ] [ edit ] William Jr. often spent winters aboard his yacht in Jacksonville, Florida , and he was responsible for the construction of a number of prominent buildings in the city. He and sixteen other businessmen founded the Florida Yacht Club in Jacksonville in 1876, although he was the only person in Florida to actually own a yacht. The club is now the oldest social club in Jacksonville and one of the oldest yacht clubs in the United States. Liking the area, Astor in 1874 purchased a land tract of around 80,000 acres (320 km 2 ) along the St. Johns River north of Orlando , in an area that is now Lake County, Florida . There he and two partners used 12,000 acres (49 km 2 ) to build an entire town that he named Manhattan; the name was later changed to Astor in his honor. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] His project, which would come to include several hotels, began with the construction of wharves on the river to accommodate steamboats. These steamboats attracted a steamship agency that could bring in the necessary materials and supplies. Astor enjoyed his development and purchased a railroad that connected the town to the "Great Lakes Region" of Florida. He donated the town's first church and the land for the local non-denominational cemetery, and he also helped build a schoolhouse, both of which are still standing today. In 1875, one of the many nearby lakes was named Lake Schermerhorn after his wife, Lina Schermerhorn. [ 9 ] [ ] The town boomed, and Astor, with an eye on the large New York market, expanded his interests to a grapefruit grove; this fruit at the time was only available on a very limited basis in other parts of the United States. He did not live long enough to see the orchard grow to production. Following his death on April 25, 1892, the property fell to his son Jack. By then though, rapid changes were taking place throughout Florida. New railroads had been built in 1885 through the central and western part of the state, and in the late 1890s Henry Flagler built a railroad line running down Florida's east coast from Daytona Beach . All this expansion left the town of Astor isolated and it was all but abandoned after train service was discontinued. [ 9 ] [ ] Personal life [ edit ] [ edit ] On September 23, 1853, he married the socially ambitious Caroline Webster "Lina" Schermerhorn (1830–1908) [ 11 ] at Trinity Church in Manhattan. [ 12 ] Her parents were Abraham Schermerhorn , a wealthy New York City merchant, and Helen Van Courtlandt (née White) Schermerhorn. [ 13 ] Lina would go on to reign over New York and Newport society known simply as "the Mrs. Astor." [ 14 ] William Jr. had little interest in society parties, and reportedly, Lina would try to keep him at his club late to prevent him coming home and sending the orchestra out and his children to bed. [ citation needed ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] citation needed Together, William Jr. and Lina had five children: Emily Astor (1854–1881), [ 15 ] who married sportsman/politician James John Van Alen (1848–1923) and had three children. [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893), [ 17 ] who married diplomat James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt (1854–1927), [ 18 ] half-brother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , and had two children. [ 18 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Charlotte Augusta Astor (1858–1920), [ 19 ] who married James Coleman Drayton (1852–1934) and had four children. [ 20 ] They divorced and she later married George Ogilvy Haig (1859–1905). [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Caroline Schermerhorn "Carrie" Astor (1861–1948), [ 22 ] who married Marshall Orme Wilson (1860–1926), [ 23 ] brother of banker Richard Thornton Wilson Jr. and socialite Grace Graham Wilson , and had two sons. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV (1864–1912), who married socialite Ava Lowle Willing (1868–1958) [ 25 ] and had two children; he later married socialite Madeleine Talmage Force (1893–1940), [ 26 ] the sister of real estate businesswoman/socialite Katherine Emmons Force , and had one son. He died in the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912. [ 27 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] William Backhouse Astor Jr. died of an aneurysm at the Hotel Liverpool in Paris. [ 1 ] Astor, an Episcopalian , was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. [ 28 ] He is one of several responsible for opening up the tourist trade in Florida.  His widow died years later in 1908.

As a Tolkien scholar he has written on a variety of topics including " The Scouring of the Shire " and Tolkien's biblical sources.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He took his MA at New York University in 1990, and he completed his PhD in 1992, also at New York University. [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Birns was a visiting professor at Western Connecticut State University from 1992 to 1993. [ 2 ] He was a professor at the New School from 1995 to 2014. [ 2 ] He joined Eugene Lang College in 2005, teaching many different courses in literature. [ 2 ] He taught at the College of New Rochelle from 2012. [ 2 ] He is an adjunct instructor at the New York University School of Professional Studies . [ 4 ] and lectures on Scottish history at the St Andrew's Society of the State of New York . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is the editor of Antipodes: A Global Journal of Australian/NZ Literature [ 8 ] and in 2024, was named a Corresponding Fellow by the Australian Academy of the Humanities. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] He is a noted Tolkien scholar , having written on topics including " The Scouring of the Shire ", [ 11 ] The Children of Hurin , [ 12 ] the wizard Radagast , [ 13 ] and Tolkien's biblical sources . [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Birns was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 2024. [ 15 ] [ ] Reception [ edit ] [ edit ] The scholar of English literature Christine Berberich , reviewing Birns's Understanding Anthony Powell for Modernism/modernity , described it as "a labor of love" and "a laudable task" undertaken with a "thorough knowledge of the subject matter", though she regretted the lack of discussion of the "influence of fascism on the British upper classes " in the 1930s, and of the holocaust , whereas the lesser-known Katyn massacre was covered in detail. [ 16 ] [ ] The scholar of Spanish and Latin American literature Eduardo Gonzalez wrote that Roberto Bolaño as World Literature was "the best Bolaño critical ensemble since Bolaño Salvaje (2006)" and had an "exemplary introduction". [ 17 ] [ ] The author and scholar of Australian literature Jean-Francois Vernay wrote of Birns's Contemporary Australian literature: A world not yet dead that it discussed the writings of Australian authors "within the wider international context, and in terms of the history of ideas". In his view, Birns "manages to think outside the box by applying tenets of neoliberalism to Australian literary studies and one learns much from this book, not least from its valuable discussions of the American reception of Australian fiction."

( September 2020 ) September 2020 ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Albert S. Axelrad (born October 22, 1938) is an American Reform rabbi , author, educator, and community leader. He fostered the American Jewish counterculture of the 1960s-1980s. [ 1 ] He also served as Jewish chaplain at Brandeis University and Executive Director of its B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation from 1965 to 1999. [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] Life and career [ edit ] [ edit ] Albert Sidney Axelrad was born in Brooklyn in 1938. He attended the Yeshivah of Flatbush and then earned a BA in sociology at Columbia University . He received an MA and, in 1965, rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. [ 3 ] [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] As Hillel director at Brandeis, Axelrad pioneered a number of programs that were adopted widely in American Jewish life, leading one student to dub him a "Jewish impresario." [ 4 ] The annual Jewish Arts Festival introduced there became a part of Hillel programming around North America . Under Axelrad's leadership, the Berlin Chapel, the Jewish chapel at Brandeis, for several years housed the office of the young Jewish counterculture's quarterly magazine Response: A Contemporary Jewish Review , which had been founded by Jewish students in New York in 1967. [ 5 ] His commitment to pluralism in Jewish communal life earned him widespread respect, even among groups for whom his religious and political views were anathema. [ 6 ] One official of the central Hillel Foundation organization described Axelrad in the 1980s as "not a Hillel director; the Hillel director." [ 2 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Axelrad was one of the founders in 1968 of Havurat Shalom in Somerville, Massachusetts , which was originally envisioned as a "community seminary" to offer a new model of rabbinic training. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The Brandeis student "egalitarian minyan " prayer groups, with Axelrad's active involvement, were among the earliest spinoffs of the new approach to Jewish prayer developed by Havurat Shalom. [ ] [ ] When Axelrad understood that many adult members of the university community, especially women, had not celebrated their bar/bat mitzvah decades earlier,  Axelrad arranged for the first " adult bar and bat mitzvah " training and celebrations in the early 1970s. [ 9 ] He and his students and friends helped popularize the practice in all denominations of North American Judaism. [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] Beginning in the first years of his rabbinate, Axelrad advocated for rabbinic officiation at marriages of a Jew and a non-Jew , although only under limited circumstances. [ 11 ] Noting that supportive non-Jewish spouses could be involved in raising Jewish children, he proposed that rabbis should be understanding of a non-Jewish partner's reluctance to convert to Judaism for any of a variety of reasons. For couples willing to raise Jewish children, Axelrad proposed that the cooperation and support of a rabbi at the outset of the marriage could be crucial in their decision to do so. [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] Advocacy and other interests [ edit ] [ edit ] Arriving at Brandeis as American involvement in the Vietnam War reached its peak, Axelrad became involved in advising students considering seeking conscientious objector status in the Selective Service military draft system . He was an active member of the Jewish Peace Fellowship . [ 13 ] Axelrad came to describe himself not as a   " pacifist " but as a "pacifoid," doing everything possible to avoid war, but also recognizing that in extreme cases war may be necessary. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Another area of Axelrad's political advocacy was in the movement for divestment from South Africa as a way of pressuring the government there to abandon apartheid . [ 16 ] He remained troubled by the anti- Israel bias of many who shared his divestment position. [ 17 ] [ ] [ ] From 1973 through 1977, Breira , the first national Jewish organization to advocate for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, counted Axelrad among its leaders. [ 18 ] [ ] In the 1970s and 1980s, Axelrad was involved in the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union , who were unable to practice Judaism and also unable to emigrate. He made Brandeis University a center of activity in the Soviet Jewry Movement of those years. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] His 1978 trip to the Soviet Union, the first of two such journeys to visit refuseniks , is documented in a brief book he wrote, Refusenik: Voices of Struggle and Hope . [ 21 ] He visited again, with a rabbinic colleague from Boston , in February, 1991. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Axelrad's interest in nonviolent resistance to tyranny led him to focus on the biblical midwives of the Hebrew women of Egypt, Shifra and Puah . [ 8 ] He publicized one of two visits to Brandeis by Avital Sharansky during her efforts to free her husband Anatoly Shcharansky (later Natan Sharansky ) from imprisonment in the Soviet Union led Axelrad to create the Shifra and Puah Award, presented annually by Brandeis Hillel. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] After his retirement from Brandeis, Axelrad served as the founding director of the Center for Spiritual Life and adjunct professor of religion at Emerson College in Boston, and as a part-time chaplain at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear , a specialty hospital in Boston.
