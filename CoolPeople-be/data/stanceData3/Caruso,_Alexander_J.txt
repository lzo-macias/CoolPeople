Raised by an Italian father and Colombian mother, both in the legal profession, understanding the law, justice, and doing the right thing runs in my blood. As a teacher, I know first-hand how broken our public education system is in NYC.  I couldn't stand by working in a system that fails our children. I’m running for the same reason I became a teacher —for the kids. If we’re not building a better society for them, then what’s the point? That means addressing our housing crisis, building better schools, and having a city government ran by tried and true public servants. This is why I’m  running for NYC Council District 19.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Caruso’s Grassroots Campaign Housing This is a call to all Queens renters to UNITE! Fight for the RIGHTS needed to save the American Dream for all renters, both residential and commercial alike. Around forty percent (24,133 units) of NYC Council District 19 are renters. We need a  City Council, with the will and courage to stand up to the real estate lobby, The Real Estate Board of New York, REBNY. Green New Deal for Public Housing: Investing in public housing to improve living conditions, create union jobs, and make buildings more sustainable without privatizing critical community assets. Expanding Homeownership: Making homeownership achievable for working families through down payment assistance and affordable housing programs. Modular Housing: Promoting modular housing to quickly and cost-effectively meet demand with sustainable and quality-built homes. Office Conversions: Turning vacant office spaces into affordable housing units, revitalizing neighborhoods, and making better use of underutilized spaces. Supportive Housing: Expand supportive housing that integrates on-site services to help vulnerable populations achieve stability and independence. Community Land Trusts: Empowering communities to control land, prevent displacement, and ensure housing remains permanently affordable. Building a Housing Pipeline: Increase supply of affordable housing, incentivizing mixed-income development, and leveraging federal and state resources for sustainable growth. Education An educator by trade, I have a passion and focus for the education system. New York State spends upwards of 45 billion dollars on education in NYC, which is the largest municipal education budget in the country. Yet our schools don’t rank in the top 10 in the United States. Unfortunately, this system has declined, spurred by poor leadership during DeBlasio and Adams mayoral administration. In the last decade alone, NYC has seen lowered test standards, and literacy rates, and cut the arts programs. Resulting in a decline in the quality of our student’s education across the board. Fight for universal after-school programs. Make CUNY colleges tuition-free! Fair Pay for Our Paraprofessionals Desegregate our schools by advocating for the repeal of Hect-Calandra at the state level, end all discriminatory screens in New York City public schools, and launch a community-led diversity plan for middle schools in Queens Build more schools! New York State has mandated smaller class sizes but the city has yet to meet these requirements. We require new school buildings to handle the amount of students in our citi’s school system. The Democratic Party is in an identity crisis! Neo-liberalism has tainted the idea of what it means to be a public servant. We had it right back when we were the Party of FDR —the days of the New Deal Democrats. With that said, I am not just running as a Democrat but also also under Working Families Party (WFP) . Because we need to get back to our roots and fight for working-class Americans. With Mayor Adams soon to be gone essentially gone, we need a new mayor of New York City. I fully back the WFP slate for mayor: City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and state Sen. Zellnor Myrie. Organize a working-class bloc within the City Council like the WFP to influence not only the Speaker’s race, committee chairs, and memberships, but also the adoption of session rules and the budget process and outcome Ensuring constituent services are proactive, not reactive, and that district offices are hubs for organizing so that constituents can access the tools, skills, and training needed to find solutions to local problems. Implement internal rules and  reforms that limit the overwhelming power of the Speaker over the Council’s legislative and budget agenda and push the bounds of the body’s power as the effective counterweight to the Mayoralty Use working groups, resident councils, and/or neighborhood block groups to influence decision-making, increase understanding of local government processes, and facilitate constant communication and co-governance Reform the NYC Government Public safety extends to more than just tackling crime; it requires a holistic approach that ensures safe streets, safe communities, and trusted public institutions. I will work to create safer neighborhoods without compromising justice and fairness. At the end of the day, I wanna fund cops, NOT robots! Fighting Gun Violence : Supporting common-sense gun laws, community-based violence prevention, and safe storage regulations to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. Safe Streets : Expanding Vision Zero, improving street lighting, and implementing traffic calming measures to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike. NYPD Accountability: It is crucial we  enhance independent oversight, transparency, and crisis intervention training so we can build trust between law enforcement and the community. Investing in Alternatives : Funding mental health response teams, violence interruption programs, and reentry support to address the root causes of crime and promote community safety. Public Safety A Green NYC With Local Law 97 now in effect, many dwellings across East Queens and NYC broadly will have to start buying new, green home appliances. While I support NYC going green, it’s not fair on the taxpayer to suddenly meet this new city compliance. If elected, I  will proudly work with NYC Councilwoman Sandra Ung and Linda Lee in passing Local Law 1197. Green Job Creation : Investing in training programs and clean energy industries to create good-paying union jobs that support a sustainable economy and workforce transition. Resilient Infrastructure : Investing in flood protection, green spaces, and renewable energy projects that create union jobs and enhance community resilience. Sustainable Transit : Expanding public transit options, building protected bike lanes, and improving access in underserved neighborhoods to reduce emissions. Green Public Housing : Modernizing public housing with energy-efficient upgrades and sustainable design to improve living conditions and cut emissions. Community-Driven Climate Action : Empower neighborhoods to lead on local climate initiatives, from urban farming to energy cooperatives, ensuring the benefits reach those most impacted.

They are certified by the State Bar and can be identified by their State Bar certification number or mark in all advertising. These services are able to: Help you determine if your problem can be resolved without a lawyer. For example, you might have a problem that could be handled, without charge, by a rent control board or community mediation program. If you need this type of assistance, the referral service may be able to connect you with the appropriate organization(s). Refer you to a lawyer who is experienced in the appropriate field of law and is a licensee of the State Bar in good standing. Lawyer referral services will refer you to attorneys with experience related to your legal needs. Refer you to a lawyer who is required to carry professional liability insurance. In general, lawyers can decide whether they want to carry this kind of insurance, but to be included in a Certified Lawyer Referral Service, a lawyer must have insurance. Having insurance is not just important in the event of malpractice. It also often means that the lawyer is supported by risk management resources and training provided by the insurance carrier. May be able to refer you to a bilingual attorney or an attorney who offers reduced rates depending on your income.

In other words, find two or more candidates and contact them for brief interviews. To find lawyers to consider, begin with these resources: Certified lawyer referral services . These agencies can refer you to a local, licensed attorney who specializes in the area of the law that fits your needs. Certified specialists. To find an attorney who is a certified specialist in certain areas of the law, such as taxation or family law, you can use the State Bar’s online certified specialist directory , which allows you to search for a certified attorney by specialty area and California county. Recommendations . Ask people you trust to recommend a lawyer who can assist you or refer you to other attorneys who have experience with your type of problem. Public defenders. If you are accused of a crime and cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free representation from a public defender. Check your county’s local listings online, or in a telephone directory, to find a public defender’s office. If there isn’t one in your area, the judge assigned to your case can appoint a private attorney to represent you free of charge. Public interest groups. Several nonprofit public interest organizations, such as those that focus on civil liberties or housing discrimination, may be able to help you find a lawyer. Prepaid legal services plans. These plans are available through certain employers, labor unions, and other organizations. Generally, if you have such a plan, you are entitled to a certain amount of a lawyer’s time and services at a reduced rate. Also: Consider dispute resolution programs. Mediation programs provide an alternative for resolving civil disputes without having to hire an attorney or go to court. The California Department of Consumer Affairs provides a list of local mediation programs . Note: Be wary of attorneys who approach you in person, by phone, or through social media to offer legal services.

Deadline: October 20, 2024, 11:59 p.m. Direct comments to Comments should be submitted using the online Public Comment Form . The online form allows you to input your comments directly. Background At its September Board meeting, the Board of Trustees approved the implementation of a one time Offer and Comprise Program to allow former and current licensees the ability to settle debt owed to the State Bar consisting of discipline costs, monetary sanctions and Client Security Fund (CSF) reimbursements. A new State Bar rule is necessary to implement this program because the State Bar Rules of Procedure already provide a process for the reduction, waiver, and extension of time for payment of discipline costs and monetary sanctions by filing a motion in State Bar Court. As such, a new rule is necessary to provide an alternative process for licensees to seek reductions of such debt, as well as first-time process to reduce CSF debt by way of participation in the program, notwithstanding these established procedures. Discussion/proposal The new rule indicates that there is good cause for the establishment of the program in order to afford licensees financial relief and to increase State Bar revenue. This language is necessary because the relevant statutes indicate that the State Bar’s discretion to reduce or waive discipline costs and CSF must be based on “hardship, special circumstances, or other good cause.” The rule also specifies that licensees may participate in the program notwithstanding any other relevant State Bar Rule or State Bar Rules of Procedures. The rule leaves the criteria for participation in the program, as well as logistics of implementation, for guidelines to be authorized by the executive director. Lastly, the rule makes clear that this is a one-time program for debt that was accrued on or before January 1, 2025.  Any fiscal/personnel impact The cost to develop the platform to manage the Offer and Compromise Program is estimated to be $750,000.

These grants are made possible with the help of charitable donations and state funds earmarked to help the most disadvantaged in our society. The three main sources of funds are: The Greg E. Knoll Justice Gap Fund , which collects tax-exempt donations from attorneys and the public to support free legal services to low-income Californians. The fund also receives “cy pres” funds, residual money from class action lawsuits, probate matters or other proceedings. The Equal Access Fund , which administers state funds allocated by the governor and state legislature. The Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA) pools the interest on money that lawyers hold for their clients in small amounts or for a short period of time.

Find out more about the State Bar’s legal aid funding. Grant applications Applications for IOLTA/EAF funding are generally available online in early April for the subsequent grant year and are due in mid-May. See sample applications, guidelines, and contact information for our grant program. online What is a legal aid grant under the IOLTA statute? The legal aid grant program was established in 1984 to distribute IOLTA revenue to nonprofit legal aid organizations, in accordance with California Business and Professions Code section 6210, et seq. (the Statute). Each year, the State Bar of California awards approximately $30 million in IOLTA and EAF grants to approximately 100 nonprofit organizations. Who receives funding? Grantees are funded to provide civil legal services without charge. Grants cannot be used to fund assistance in criminal law matters, outside California, or matters involving nonindigent clients. “Indigent” is defined by the Statute to include individuals whose income is 200 percent or less of the federal poverty threshold, who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income, and/or who are eligible for free services under the Older Americans Act or Developmentally Disabled Assistance Act. In the case of certain grantees whose principal means of service delivery in a given county is through pro bono attorneys, “indigent” also includes any person whose income is 75 percent or less of the maximum levels of income for lower-income households as defined in California Health & Safety Code section 50079.5. (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 6213 (d)). Grants support work on a wide spectrum of legal issues including family law, landlord-tenant, restraining orders, probate, adoption and guardianship, workplace and employment issues, debt and fraud, immigration and citizenship, and senior services, among other areas. A full list of 2024 grantees is available online. Under authority delegated by the State Bar Board of Trustees, eligibility for grants is determined by the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission. The Statute has been implemented through a number of State Bar Rules and the Eligibility Guidelines for Legal Services Projects and Eligibility Guidelines for Support Centers . The statute provides for grants to two kinds of organizations: Qualified Legal Services Projects (QLSPs), which provide civil legal services without charge directly to indigent clients. These may include law school clinical programs, as defined below. Qualified Support Centers, which provide legal training, legal technical assistance, and advocacy support without charge to the legal community. Qualified legal services projects (QLSPs) Qualified legal services projects (QLSPs) Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6213(a), a "qualified legal services project" means either of the following: (1) A nonprofit project incorporated and operated exclusively in California that provides as its primary purpose and function legal services without charge to indigent persons and that has quality control procedures approved by the State Bar. (2) A program operated exclusively in California by a nonprofit law school accredited by the State Bar that has been in operation for at least two years at a cost of at least $20,000 dollars per year as an indentifiable law school unit with a primary purpose and function of providing legal services without charge to indigent persons. The program must have quality control procedures approved by the State Bar.

The program must have quality control procedures approved by the State Bar. Qualified support center Qualified support center A “qualified support center” is defined as an incorporated nonprofit legal services center that has as its primary purpose and function the provision of legal training, legal technical assistance, or advocacy support without charge, and which actually provides through an office in California a significant level of legal training, legal technical assistance, or advocacy support without charge to QLSPs on a statewide basis in California.

Applicants must meet the primary purpose requirements described in Business and Professions Code section 6213 (see descriptions above for Qualified Legal Services Projects and Qualified Support Centers). Additionally, in determining primary purpose: Applicants must meet the primary purpose requirements described in Business and Professions Code section 6213 (see descriptions above for Qualified Legal Services Projects and Qualified Support Centers). Additionally, in determining primary purpose: Applicants must meet the primary purpose requirements described in Business and Professions Code section 6213 (see descriptions above for Qualified Legal Services Projects and Qualified Support Centers). Additionally, in determining primary purpose: A QLSP is presumed to meet the primary purpose and function requirement when 75 percent or more of its expenditures are directed to free legal services to indigent people. A Qualified Support Center is presumed to meet primary purpose and function if 75 percent or more of its expenditures are directed to providing legal support services without charge (legal training, legal technical assistance, and advocacy support.) Applicants must provide an audited financial statement by an independent certified public accountant, or a financial review if its gross corporate expenditures are less than $500,000. (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 6222; State Bar Rule 3.680(E)(1); Eligibility Guideline 2.7.1). Eligibility for legal aid grants is determined by the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission, subject to approval by the State Bar Board of Trustees. Potential applicants may refer to the following considerations in assessing whether or not to pursue funding: Your organization may be eligible if your organization is applying as a Legal Services Project: Your organization does not charge for its services The majority of your organization's expenses are directly related to providing legal services to indigent people in California The vast majority of your organization's clients are under 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold, are eligible for Supplemental Security Income, or are eligible for free services under the Older Americans Act or Developmentally Disabled Assistance Act Your organization has clear quality control procedures If your organization is a law school clinic, the clinic has operated for at least two years at a cost of at least $20,000 per year and is an identifiable unit of the law school (e.g., autonomous leadership, designated office space, separate financial schedule for the clinic). If your organization is applying for a pro bono county allocation, it annually recruits at least 30 attorneys, 5 percent of its county’s actively volunteering attorneys, or 1,000 hours of volunteered attorney time, and meets additional requirements to demonstrate that the principal means of delivery of service is through pro bono. If your organization is applying as a Support Center: The majority of your organizations expenses are directly related to providing legal support services without charge Your organization provides a significant amount of legal support services (legal training, legal technical assistance, advocacy support) to QLSPs in California without charge The majority of your organizations expenses are directly related to providing legal support services without charge Your organization provides a significant amount of legal support services (legal training, legal technical assistance, advocacy support) to QLSPs in California without charge Your organization may be ineligible if your organization is applying as a Legal Services Project: Your organization charges for some or all of its services, even on a sliding scale. Your organization provides some legal services, but spends as much or more annually providing non-legal services (e.g., job training, financial literacy, residential housing, etc.). Many of your organization’s clients exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold and are not eligible for Supplemental Security Income or free services under the Older Americans Act or Developmentally Disabled Assistance Act. Your organization focuses on out-of-state work, or your program is a California branch of a nationwide nonprofit organization. You are a legal services department or a program within an organization that provides a number of non-legal services. Your organization is new and does not yet have audited financial statements for a full fiscal year. In addition: If your organization is a law school clinic, the clinic has not been in operation for at least two years at a cost of at least $20,000 per year or is not an identifiable unit of the law school (e.g., no autonomous leadership, no designated office space, no separate financial schedule for the clinic). If your organization is applying for a pro bono county allocation, it does not annually recruit at least 30 attorneys, 5 percent of the county’s actively volunteering attorneys, or 1,000 hours of volunteered attorney time, and is not able to demonstrate that the principal means of delivery of service is through pro bono. If you are applying as a Support Center: Your organization charges for its services, even on a sliding scale. Your organization spends a significant amount of time providing direct legal services to clients, rather than legal support to direct service providers. Your organization focuses on out-of-state work. Your organization does not currently provide a significant level of legal support to existing QLSPs. The requirement of a “significant” level of support is discussed in the Support Center Eligibility Guidelines. Under no circumstances will it be met with service to fewer than ten different QLSPs. Your organization is a legal services department or program within a larger organization that provides a number of non-legal services. Your organization is new and does not yet have audited financial statements for a full fiscal year. What are the grant amounts? IOLTA grants and “IOLTA-Formula” Equal Access Fund grants utilize the same formula for determining grant amounts. The statutory formula that determines grant amounts is based on the grantees’ expenditures for civil legal aid without charge to indigent persons. Based on the statutory formula, funding can range from under $10,000 for smaller programs to over $1,000,000 for larger programs. The formula for calculating IOLTA grant distributions, found in Business and Professions Code section 6216, is as follows: Fifteen percent of the total available for each grant fund is divided equally among all qualifying Support Centers. The remaining 85 percent of available funding is allocated across California’s 58 counties based on each county’s relative share of the state’s population of persons with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold. For each county where a QLSP is providing services primarily through volunteer attorneys, ten percent of that county’s allocation is set aside for pro bono programs that utilize pro bono attorneys as their principal means of service delivery. Applicants for funding as QLSPs identify the counties where they provide free civil legal services, and how much they spent providing such services in each county. Each county’s allocation is proportionally divided among the qualified QLSPs based on their relative share of the total prior-year expenditures for free legal services by QLSPs in that county. In any county in which any applicant for QLSP funding is eligible as a “pro bono” program, ten percent of that county’s allocation is set aside for those pro bono programs. This sum is distributed on the same pro-rata basis, among all the “pro bono” programs in that county. Applicants for funding as QLSPs identify the counties where they provide free civil legal services, and how much they spent providing such services in each county. Each county’s allocation is proportionally divided among the qualified QLSPs based on their relative share of the total prior-year expenditures for free legal services by QLSPs in that county. In any county in which any applicant for QLSP funding is eligible as a “pro bono” program, ten percent of that county’s allocation is set aside for those pro bono programs. This sum is distributed on the same pro-rata basis, among all the “pro bono” programs in that county. How do I apply? Organizations interested in applying for legal aid grants should visit the online grant portal to review California Business and Professions Code sections 6210–6228, the State Bar Rules, the relevant Eligibility Guidelines, and a sample application. After reviewing these authorities, if your organization is interested in applying please contact the Office of Access & Inclusion to set up an introductory call. As the application process is time-intensive, we find it is beneficial for new organizations to discuss eligibility requirements and grantee obligations before completing an application. If you have questions about applying for a grant or to set up an introductory call, call 415-538-2252 or email trustfundprogram@calbar.ca.gov . Complaints Grant recipients must abide by the IOLTA Statute and related State Bar Rules to remain eligible for funding. Members of the public who know or believe that a grant recipient fails to meet one or more of the requirements for these grants can submit a written complaint to the Office of Access & Inclusion with details of the alleged violation, and the Office of Access & Inclusion will investigate. (See State Bar Rule 3.692 for more information.) Please note that this process is restricted to whether grantee organizations are compliant with their grant requirements; it is not intended to resolve disputes about level of service (for example). Complaints may be submitted to trustfundprogram@calbar.ca.gov .

California Rule of Court 9.35 served as the basis for the creation of the State Bar Legal Specialization program. The program was intended to provide a method for attorneys to earn the designation of certified specialist in particular areas of law, increasing public protection and encouraging attorney competence. The program was the first of its kind in the United States, and it has served as a model for other state programs for certifying legal specialists around the nation. Admissions Applicant Portal The Legal Specialization program is now administered through the Admissions Applicant Portal . Through the Applicant Portal, licensees can register for the Legal Specialist Examination, apply for initial certification or recertification, report Legal Specialist Continuing Legal Education (LSCLE) Compliance, or submit other legal specialization requests. Current certified specialists can find initial certification dates, current certification terms, and LSCLE compliance dates all in the Applicant Portal. All California licensees have a current Applicant Portal account. Note that a new account should not be registered or created. If you need assistance logging in, please see our Applicant Portal FAQs or fill out the Licensee Record and Compliance Inquiry form . Note that (1) the Applicant Portal and your My State Bar Profile utilize separate login credentials; and (2) any updates to your contact information in the Applicant Portal do not affect your information in your My State Bar Profile, or vice-versa. Requirements The general requirements to become a certified specialist include: passage of a written examination in the legal specialty area practiced law continuously for at least five years, spending at least 25 percent of the time given to occupational endeavors practicing in the specialty area completion of continuing education in the specialty area greater than that required of general licensees of the State Bar demonstration of a broad-based and comprehensive experience in the specialty area based on completion of a variety of matters in the specialty area favorable evaluations by other attorneys and judges familiar with the attorney's work in the specialty area of law The State Bar of California must approve each attorney’s application. Organizations whose certification program is State Bar-accredited can also certify attorneys, but their certification requirements must equal or exceed those of the State Bar of California’s program. Once certified, specialists must maintain their certification by: paying the Legal Specialization Program Annual Fee each year; reporting compliance of the education requirement by completing 36 hours of LSCLE every three years, due at the same time as their MCLE reporting date; and reporting compliance of the task & experience and reference requirements by recertifying in five years.
