The CFB may choose to stop offering Contribute, or any particular portion of Contribute, or modify or replace any aspect of Contribute, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to Contribute, where, in the CFB's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you.

Contribute Contribute Contribute Contribute Privacy Policy Contribute (“Contribute”) is an online credit and debit card contributions
platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (“the Website”) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically
collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the
following: The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a user’s Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,
Internet Explorer, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer. The date and time a user visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to
Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a user’s Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,

Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The CFB uses this information to identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility
with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New York’s Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFB’s work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFB’s work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

NYC Votes! How to Vote Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions How can we help you? Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections? Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results? The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day. However, these results will not include any absentee ballot votes. After they receive all absentee ballots, they will finish counting and release certified final results. You can find election results at the NYC Board of Elections website. Visit the Board of Elections website Vote by Mail Back to Top Can I still vote in person if I request or submit an absentee ballot? If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Learn more about voting by mail Can I drop off my absentee ballot at my poll site? Yes! You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any NYC poll site. Ballot boxes will be available at the front desk. You can also drop off your ballot at any Board of Elections office . You do not need postage if you are dropping off your ballot. Learn more about voting by mail Can I track my absentee ballot after I return it? Yes! The Board of Elections’ ballot tracker will let you know the status of your ballot after you submit a request. It will also let you know if they have received your completed ballot and whether it’s valid. Track your ballot Can I fix my absentee ballot if I made a mistake? The Board of Elections is required by law to notify you if there is a curable error on your ballot envelope, such as a missing or incorrect signature. If there is a fixable error on your ballot, they will contact you by mail, email, and phone (if available) within 1 day of discovering the error. You will then have a minimum of 5 days to correct the error by returning a signed affirmation. Learn more about voting by mail Can I vote absentee in person? Sounds strange, but it’s true! You can vote absentee in person at your borough’s Board of Elections office. Offices are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, and on the weekend prior to Election Day. This can be a helpful option if you miss the deadline to request a ballot online or by mail. On Election Day offices are open until 9pm. Find your local Board of Elections office Can I join a permanent absentee ballot list? Yes!

It is the campaign’s responsibility to report your contribution correctly and claim it for matching funds. What happens to my money when I contribute to a campaign? Candidates running for local New York City office have the option of using Contribute as their online fundraising platform.

Do I need to create a new account for the current election cycle? If you had a Contribute account in a previous election cycle, you can simply log in using your existing email and password, then you will be prompted to connect to a Stripe account. If you ran in a previous election, you cannot reuse an old Stripe account. After logging into your Contribute account, you must create a new Stripe account by using an email address that is easily accessible by the candidate, treasurer, and anyone else monitoring your Contribute account, as time-sensitive emails may be sent by Stripe to this email address. How do I sign up for Contribute? 1.    Sign up at contribute.nycvotes.org/signup After registering with the CFB, your campaign will have access to Contribute.

You will need to complete fields such as: Type of business: Select “Nonprofit Organization” Legal business name: Enter the committee’s name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select “Political Organization” How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select “Within One Day” Executive Details: The campaign’s Stripe account should be created by the candidate (strongly recommended), treasurer, or another campaign representative with significant managerial control.

Receive Contribute link After creating your Stripe account, you will receive an email that confirms that your Contribute account has been connected to Stripe, and that contains your unique Contribute link. This link can be used for promotional materials, campaign flyers and mailings, and social media posts. Once you have connected your Contribute account with Stripe, your campaign can begin receiving contributions. Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions. You can confirm your payout schedule and estimated payout timing in your Stripe Dashboard . How do I upload contributions to C-SMART? After receiving contributions, you must upload your credit card contribution data and documentation directly into C-SMART. You must perform the upload for contributions to appear in C-SMART; otherwise, your disclosure statement will not include contributions received via Contribute and you will lose the opportunity to claim any eligible contributions for matching funds. IMPORTANT: Do not manually enter C-SMART contributions received via Contribute. If you notice that a contribution is not uploading correctly into C-SMART, contact your Candidate Services liaison. 1.    Sign in to your campaign’s Contribute account Go to contribute.nycvotes.org/login and enter your CFB-registered email address and Contribute password. 2.    Enter your C-SMART encryption key When you log in, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page.

For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute. For more information on how to edit contributions to claim them for matching funds, see Monetary Contributions in C-SMART Help Use the Contribute Upload Report in C-SMART to assist you when claiming contributions from Contribute for match. The report contains each contribution’s C-SMART transaction ID and the matching amount. Additionally, the report includes an indicator that tells you whether the matching amount has been updated. How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time? Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements? Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. How can we help you?

It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes?  No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot?  If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot. However, the voting machine will not let you know if you skip rankings or rank the same candidate multiple times, since your top-choice vote will still count in those cases. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot When can I expect results in Ranked Choice Voting elections?  Final results in Ranked Choice elections will not be known until all absentee and military ballots are counted, which could take several weeks after Election Day. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Where can I find official election results?  The NYC Board of Elections will share unofficial election results after polls close on Election Day.

You will need to complete fields such as: Type of business: Select “Nonprofit Organization” Legal business name: Enter the committee’s name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select “Political Organization” How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select “Within One Day” Type of business: Select “Nonprofit Organization” Legal business name: Enter the committee’s name (as disclosed to the IRS and CFB) Business website: If your committee does not have a website, you can use contribute.nycvotes.org for this field Business description: Select “Political Organization” How long after paying will customers typically receive their goods or services?: Select “Within One Day” Executive Details: The campaign’s Stripe account should be created by the candidate (strongly recommended), treasurer, or another campaign representative with significant managerial control.

For more information on how to access and use this report, review Reports in C-SMART Help . You should also compare the total number of contributions on the C-SMART report to the total number displayed in the Contribute Activity Report , which can be accessed through your Contribute account page. In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute.

How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART?  In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page. The fees available to upload will be based on the amount reflected on your monthly account statements, which are emailed to your campaign on the 10th day of each month, and cover activity for the preceding month. When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload. Note : If there were no contributions received for a given month, there will be no Stripe fees available to upload for that month. Upon your first upload of Stripe fees to C-SMART, a new name record will be created for Stripe in C-SMART to report the lump sum amount of fees deducted for the month. In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

Where can I see a list of my contributions by date/time?  From the Data tab of your account page, click Email Contribute Activity Report . You will receive an email with a spreadsheet containing your Contribute financial activity to date. How can I initiate refunds to contributors?  For prohibited contributions (e.g. corporate or over-the-limit contributions), refunds can be issued via Stripe, certified or bank check, or ACH transfer.

To set custom contribution amounts for fundraising events, navigate to the Fundraising Events tab and change event contribution amounts on the Tools tab of each event’s administrative page. Can I use Contribute for multiple committees at the same time?  Yes. As a candidate or treasurer, you can access multiple committees from one Contribute login, as long as you are using the same email address on your committees’ CFB registrations. This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account. Note: as with any post-election fundraising or spending, you are required to report contributions received via Contribute as well as monthly Stripe fees with the corresponding periodic disclosure deadline . If you are using Contribute for multiple campaigns simultaneously, you will need to upload data from the Data tab of each campaign’s account dashboard. Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States?  Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?  Contribute helps by collecting the contributor information the CFB requires for compliance and disclosure purposes including employment information, “doing business” status, and the contribution affirmations required by law. Ultimately it is the campaign’s responsibility to ensure the required information for each contribution is accurately reported to the CFB. Still have questions? Contact us on social media!

NYC Votes! Who We Are In this Section: Contact Us NYC Votes is an initiative of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, the independent city agency that ensures local elections are fair, inclusive, and open. We boost participation among voters and candidates alike so that our elected officials address the needs of our diverse communities and the issues voters care about. We do this by empowering New Yorkers who are less likely to vote, reducing barriers to running for office, and offering solutions to improve our election system. NYC Votes partners with community organizations, volunteers, and other city agencies to register, educate, and engage voters across the city. We aim to build a greater understanding of the electoral process for all New Yorkers by having an honest dialogue about how our elections work and why they matter . Established in 1988, the agency also equips New Yorkers with information about the candidates on their ballot and how their campaigns are funded. Our matching funds program matches every $1 from a local donor with up to $8 of city funding, encouraging city candidates to focus on their communities instead of special interests.

What is meant by "doing business"? Contributions from people associated with entities that do business with city government are regulated in order to reduce the potential for, and appearance of, “pay-to-play” corruption. These contributors are subject to lower contribution limits and their contributions are not eligible to be matched with public funds. The city’s Doing Business Database (DBDB) lists these people and their associated entities. The DBDB is available to the public, and campaigns can check to see whether their contributors are listed. Entities that engage in, apply for, or are awarded any of the following have “business dealings” with the city: Contracts Franchises Concessions Grants Lobbying Land use actions Real property agreements Pension fund investment contracts Economic development agreements The regulations apply to certain individuals associated with those entities: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or its equivalent Chief Operating Officer (COO) or its equivalent Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or its equivalent Anyone who owns or controls more than 10% of the entity Senior managers who, whether by title or duties, have substantial discretion and oversight in business transactions with the city Lobbyists required to register with the City Clerk are also covered. Under a separate law, contributions from the spouses, domestic partners, unemancipated children, and employees of registered lobbyists are not eligible to be matched with public funds but are not subject to the doing business contribution limits. What sort of restrictions apply to contributions from people in the database? Contributions from or intermediated by anyone in the DBDB will not be matched with public funds. In addition, people in the database are subject to lower contribution limits, which vary by office: Office Doing Business Contribution Limit Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller $400 Borough President $320 City Council $250 How can someone determine if they have business dealings with the city? The DBDB can be searched by people’s names or their associated entities. Someone may not be aware that an organization with which they are associated does business with the city. They can confirm their status by checking the database before making contributions. Why might someone think they should be in the DBDB when they are not? A person will not be considered doing business with the city merely because s/he: works for the city drives a city taxi hires a lobbyist seeks permits for his or her 1, 2, or 3 family home applies for street permits, including parades or street fairs other similar individual activities with the city What transactions are included in the doing business regulations, and how long are individuals listed in the DBDB? Contracts, Concessions and Franchises: proposing on or holding $100,000 in goods or service contracts, $500,000 in construction contracts, or $100,000 in concessions or franchises; or being awarded $100,000 in City Council or borough president discretionary allocations. Contracts of $5,000 or less, publically-advertised competitive sealed bids, and emergency contracts are not covered. Contract and concession proposers are covered for one year from the date of the proposal or bid. Awardees are covered for the term of the contract or concession plus one year. Franchise proposers are covered for one year from the proposal submission date. If the entity receives the franchise, it is covered for one year from the award date. Grants: receiving grants totaling $100,000. Grants of $5,000 or less are not covered. Recipients are covered for one year from the award date. Economic development agreements: applying for or receiving an economic development agreement. Incentives qualified for by operation of law are excluded. Applicants are covered from the application date to when a decision is made. Recipients remain covered until the end of the agreement, plus one year. Contracts for the investment of pension funds: proposing on or holding a contract for the investment of pension funds,includingany investment in a private equity firm and any contract with an investment-related consultant. Proposers are covered from the earlier of the presentation of investment opportunity or the submission of a proposal, to when a decision is made. Awardees remain covered through the term of the transaction plus one year. Real property transactions: the purchase, sale, or lease of real property with or by the city, including office space, or any application or proposal for the same. Transactions awarded by public auction or competitive sealed bid are excluded, as are certain affordable housing transactions. Proposers are covered from the proposal date to when a decision is made. Lessors of the city remain covered through the lease term, plus one year. Lessees of the city and entities that buy or sell real property remain covered for one year from the date the agreement is finalized. Land use actions: land use applications subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) under City Charter §197c and any application for leases (§195) or zoning changes (§201). Applications for zoning changes involving owner-occupants of 1, 2, or 3familyhomesareexcluded,asare permits. Land use action applicants are generally covered from the date of certification (§197c and §201) or application (most §195 actions) to when the City Council files its action with the Mayor, plus 120 days. When the city is leasing office space under §195, coverage runs from application through lease agreement, plus one year. Lobbyists: any firm or person required to register as a lobbyist with the Office of the City Clerk, including placement agents. This does not include entities that hire a lobbyist (clients). Lobbyists are covered whenever they are listed on a lobbying registration. The contents of the DBDB are determined by the Doing Business Accountability Project of the Mayor’s Office of Contract Services (MOCS). For questions about whether or for how long an entity should be included in the DBDB, contact MOCS at 212-298-0600 or DoingBusiness@mocs.nyc.gov . For Campaigns What is a Doing Business Notification? After you file a disclosure statement, the CFB will review your campaign’s contributions to ensure compliance with the doing business law. The CFB will notify your campaign of over-the-limit contributions within 20 calendar days. In the six weeks preceding an election, the CFB will notify your campaign within four business days. Following both types of notification, you have 20 days to issue a refund for the overage and provide documentation of the refund to the CFB. The law does not allow extensions of this 20-day response deadline. Any questions about the notification must be asked prior to the deadline, as unresolved questions do not grant campaigns an extension. The notification lists each contribution over the doing business limit and states the required refund. Sometimes there are multiple small contributions that, together, exceed the limit. Contributions from people on the DBDB are also not matchable, but the notification does not list invalid claims. The campaign’s regular statement review will include these contributions on the Invalid Matching Claims report. You can avoid receiving notifications by checking each contribution against the Doing Business Database and either not accepting them or refunding the over-the-limit portion before the next disclosure statement. How will I get the Doing Business Notification? If you have contributions over the applicable doing business limit, you will receive a notification via the CFB Portal . How Do I Respond? To resolve the notification, your campaign will need to: Provide a refund of the over-the-limit portion to each contributor cited in the notification. Refunds must be issued by bank or certified check. If the contribution was claimed for match, withdraw the matching claim in C-SMART. You must respond to the CFB with a copy of the refund check issued for each over-the-limit contribution, labeled with the transaction ID, within 20 days. To submit your response, you can ether: Upload refund documentation directly to C-SMART (For assistance, please see Submit Monetary Contribution Refund Documentation to the CFB in C-SMART Help .) Or email refund documentation as attachments to CFBDoingBusiness@nyccfb.info . If you fail to issue a refund, the CFB may deduct the excess contributions from future public funds payments and may assess penalties to your campaign. Will this be part of the regular reviews that the CFB sends to each campaign (statement reviews)? No. Campaigns will receive regular statement reviews separate from the Doing Business Notifications. How does the CFB match data in the Doing Business Database to contributor information? The CFB uses an automated system to identify potential matches of contributors to people in the DBDB. Each match is individually assessed, using information reported by the campaign and contained in the DBDB. If a match is unclear, the individual is researched further so that the CFB can be as certain as possible whether the contributor is in the DBDB. How can a campaign check if a contributor has business dealings with the city? Campaigns should look up contributors in the DBDB . Campaigns can also ask contributors directly, contributors may not be aware of their doing business status. Since the database is the source for the CFB’s decisions, it is more reliable and should be checked when accepting contributions that exceed the doing business limits, either on their own or aggregated with previous contributions from the same contributor. The CFB’s contribution card template includes detailed information about doing business regulations. If the campaign designs its own contribution card, it must contain the phrase: If a contributor has business dealings with the City as defined in the Campaign Finance Act, such contributor may contribute only up to $250 for city council, $320 for borough president, and $400 for mayor, comptroller, or public advocate. What should a campaign do if it thinks a contributor is not the person who is in the Doing Business Database? The more complete and accurate the campaign’s reporting of contributor information, the less likely a mismatch is to occur. However, if a campaign believes a contributor is not the person in the DBDB, it must provide the CFB with records or data to demonstrate this. The campaign could also send the CFB a signed statement from the contributor, asserting that s/he is not the person in the DBDB and is not associated with the doing business entity in any capacity. Because people may be in the DBDB in connection with organizations that do not employ them, simply stating that the contributor works for a different employer than the doing business entity is not sufficient. An example of a possible misidentification is a case where two individuals have the same name but different suffixes (e.g., Jr. and Sr.) and are reported without the suffix in either the DBDB or the campaign’s reporting. Campaigns can contact the CFB at 212-409-1800 or CFBDoingBusiness@nyccfb.info for guidance about what led to the match determination. What if a contributor is in the Doing Business Database but tells the campaign s/he isn’t doing business with the city? People may be in the DBDB due to relationships other than paid employment. However, if a contributor is no longer associated with the entity that has listed him/her in the DBDB, he/she should contact the entity to complete and submit a DBA Update Form to the Doing Business Accountability Project at DoingBusiness@mocs.nyc.gov . If this is unsuccessful, s/he should complete and submit a Removal Request Form . The CFB will be notified when a removal occurs. Contact the Doing Business Accountability project at 212-298-0600 for additional information. What if the CFB says a contributor is in the Doing Business Database but the campaign can't find him/her there? Contact the CFB prior to the response deadline with any questions. If contributors were in the DBDB at the time of their contributions, but are no longer doing business at the time of notification, they may not appear in the public DBDB when the notification is received. These contributors are still subject to the contribution limits and refunds must be issued by the deadline. In other cases, the campaign may look for contributors in the DBDB at the time of the contribution and not find them, only to be later notified by the CFB that they were doing business at the time. This may occur because the DBDB is updated once a month, meaning it may take several weeks for new listings to appear. If you have difficulty finding a contributor in the DBDB, you must contact the CFB prior to the response deadline, as you may still be required to issue a refund. How should the campaign treat a matching claim that is marked invalid because the contribution’s intermediary is doing business with the city? The matching claim must be withdrawn for any contributions intermediated by individuals listed in the DBDB. Contributions intermediated by people in the DBDB cannot be matched with public funds. If the campaign believes the intermediary is not doing business with the city, it may pursue the same actions as if it believes a contributor is not the person in the DBDB or is no longer associated with the entity, as described above. The doing business status of the intermediary is not related to that of the contributor. If the campaign demonstrates that the intermediary is not the person in the DBDB or was not doing business at the time of his/her intermediated contributions, the contributions will be eligible for match if otherwise acceptable to the Board. What if the contributor who is doing business is the candidate or a close family member of the candidate? Contributions from the candidate or the candidate’s parent, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle, cousin, niece or nephew by blood or marriage are not subject to the doing business regulations. Does the law apply to in-kind contributions? Yes. In-kind contributions of goods or services, including discounts not available to the general public, are subject to the same contribution limits and source restrictions as monetary contributions as stated in chapter 2 of the Handbook . What if someone who is not in the Doing Business Database gives a campaign a contribution up to the regular contribution limit, and then later becomes the officer of a firm that gets a city contract? What happens to that contribution? The law is not retroactive. If the person was not doing business at the time of the contribution, the campaign may keep the contribution, provided that doing so does not violate any other part of the Campaign Finance Act. However, the campaign may not accept any subsequent funds from that contributor while s/he is on the DBDB. The contributor will be considered already at the Doing Business limit and all further contributions will be required to be refunded.

Will this be part of the regular reviews that the CFB sends to each campaign (statement reviews)? No. Campaigns will receive regular statement reviews separate from the Doing Business Notifications. How does the CFB match data in the Doing Business Database to contributor information? The CFB uses an automated system to identify potential matches of contributors to people in the DBDB. Each match is individually assessed, using information reported by the campaign and contained in the DBDB. If a match is unclear, the individual is researched further so that the CFB can be as certain as possible whether the contributor is in the DBDB. How can a campaign check if a contributor has business dealings with the city? Campaigns should look up contributors in the DBDB . Campaigns can also ask contributors directly, contributors may not be aware of their doing business status. Since the database is the source for the CFB’s decisions, it is more reliable and should be checked when accepting contributions that exceed the doing business limits, either on their own or aggregated with previous contributions from the same contributor. The CFB’s contribution card template includes detailed information about doing business regulations. If the campaign designs its own contribution card, it must contain the phrase: If a contributor has business dealings with the City as defined in the Campaign Finance Act, such contributor may contribute only up to $250 for city council, $320 for borough president, and $400 for mayor, comptroller, or public advocate. What should a campaign do if it thinks a contributor is not the person who is in the Doing Business Database? The more complete and accurate the campaign’s reporting of contributor information, the less likely a mismatch is to occur. However, if a campaign believes a contributor is not the person in the DBDB, it must provide the CFB with records or data to demonstrate this. The campaign could also send the CFB a signed statement from the contributor, asserting that s/he is not the person in the DBDB and is not associated with the doing business entity in any capacity. Because people may be in the DBDB in connection with organizations that do not employ them, simply stating that the contributor works for a different employer than the doing business entity is not sufficient. An example of a possible misidentification is a case where two individuals have the same name but different suffixes (e.g., Jr. and Sr.) and are reported without the suffix in either the DBDB or the campaign’s reporting. Campaigns can contact the CFB at 212-409-1800 or CFBDoingBusiness@nyccfb.info for guidance about what led to the match determination. What if a contributor is in the Doing Business Database but tells the campaign s/he isn’t doing business with the city? People may be in the DBDB due to relationships other than paid employment. However, if a contributor is no longer associated with the entity that has listed him/her in the DBDB, he/she should contact the entity to complete and submit a DBA Update Form to the Doing Business Accountability Project at DoingBusiness@mocs.nyc.gov . If this is unsuccessful, s/he should complete and submit a Removal Request Form . The CFB will be notified when a removal occurs. Contact the Doing Business Accountability project at 212-298-0600 for additional information. What if the CFB says a contributor is in the Doing Business Database but the campaign can't find him/her there? Contact the CFB prior to the response deadline with any questions. If contributors were in the DBDB at the time of their contributions, but are no longer doing business at the time of notification, they may not appear in the public DBDB when the notification is received. These contributors are still subject to the contribution limits and refunds must be issued by the deadline. Contact the CFB prior to the response deadline with any questions. If contributors were in the DBDB at the time of their contributions, but are no longer doing business at the time of notification, they may not appear in the public DBDB when the notification is received. These contributors are still subject to the contribution limits and refunds must be issued by the deadline. In other cases, the campaign may look for contributors in the DBDB at the time of the contribution and not find them, only to be later notified by the CFB that they were doing business at the time. This may occur because the DBDB is updated once a month, meaning it may take several weeks for new listings to appear. If you have difficulty finding a contributor in the DBDB, you must contact the CFB prior to the response deadline, as you may still be required to issue a refund. In other cases, the campaign may look for contributors in the DBDB at the time of the contribution and not find them, only to be later notified by the CFB that they were doing business at the time. This may occur because the DBDB is updated once a month, meaning it may take several weeks for new listings to appear. If you have difficulty finding a contributor in the DBDB, you must contact the CFB prior to the response deadline, as you may still be required to issue a refund. How should the campaign treat a matching claim that is marked invalid because the contribution’s intermediary is doing business with the city? The matching claim must be withdrawn for any contributions intermediated by individuals listed in the DBDB. Contributions intermediated by people in the DBDB cannot be matched with public funds. If the campaign believes the intermediary is not doing business with the city, it may pursue the same actions as if it believes a contributor is not the person in the DBDB or is no longer associated with the entity, as described above. The doing business status of the intermediary is not related to that of the contributor. If the campaign demonstrates that the intermediary is not the person in the DBDB or was not doing business at the time of his/her intermediated contributions, the contributions will be eligible for match if otherwise acceptable to the Board. What if the contributor who is doing business is the candidate or a close family member of the candidate? Contributions from the candidate or the candidate’s parent, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle, cousin, niece or nephew by blood or marriage are not subject to the doing business regulations. Does the law apply to in-kind contributions? Yes. In-kind contributions of goods or services, including discounts not available to the general public, are subject to the same contribution limits and source restrictions as monetary contributions as stated in chapter 2 of the Handbook . What if someone who is not in the Doing Business Database gives a campaign a contribution up to the regular contribution limit, and then later becomes the officer of a firm that gets a city contract? What happens to that contribution? The law is not retroactive. If the person was not doing business at the time of the contribution, the campaign may keep the contribution, provided that doing so does not violate any other part of the Campaign Finance Act. However, the campaign may not accept any subsequent funds from that contributor while s/he is on the DBDB. The contributor will be considered already at the Doing Business limit and all further contributions will be required to be refunded.

We are not liable for delays caused by a mail or email service or any contribution or clearinghouse system. Privacy of Information These Terms include our privacy policy , which describes how we use your personal information. By using this Website, you acknowledge that we will receive certain personal information, and that you are voluntarily providing this information to us. We will not rent, sell or otherwise make available to any third party any information that identifies you or contributions you make, other than to the Campaign to which you are contributing, or to process your contribution, or to comply with applicable law, rules or regulations, including the requirement that we post contributor names, employers, occupations, and the amount of their contributions on the CFB website. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Your information will be shared with both the Campaign to which you are contributing and with us, just as it would be if you made a credit or debit card contribution directly to the Campaign at a Campaign event using a credit card reader or similar device or by using the Campaign’s website. Access to Other Information The Website maintains records containing personal information about contributors, or information that can be identified or associated with a particular contributor, for the purposes of providing public disclosure, as part of the CFB’s routine business as an agency of the City of New York, in furtherance of its missions and duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York. Examples of this information include the name of the Campaign receiving the contribution, a contributor’s address, employer, or occupation, and the amount of the contributor’s contribution. To the extent these records contain information that is not considered confidential, such information may be disclosed to the public, posted on the CFB website, or made available to the campaign through Website as part of the contribution information. If you are concerned about the accuracy of any information displayed on the CFB website, you must contact the campaign to which you gave the contribution. Credit card transaction information may be stored by the Campaign’s payment processor. Security To process your contribution securely, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a security protocol that provides data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity for connections to the Internet, to ensure that Account numbers and personal data you provide by using the Website are not transmitted over the Internet unencrypted and cannot be viewed by unauthorized individuals. Using the Website Contribute is an Internet-based service that allows you to make contributions to a Campaign via the Internet using your credit or debit card. By using the Website you instruct Stripe, the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to debit or charge your Account, which allows your contribution to be forwarded to the Campaign, based on the Campaign’s agreement with its payment processor and the contribution instructions you provide on the Website, subject to this Agreement. In order to use the Website, you must provide all requested information. Because federal law prohibits contributions by foreign nationals, you must be a United States citizen or a green card holder. The contribution must be made in U.S. dollars and is not tax-deductible.  The contribution must be made from your own funds and not from funds provided to you by another person or entity. The Account must be your own and must be a personal account, not a business account. You authorize the Campaign’s payment processor or its authorized agent to electronically order the Financial Institution to debit (i.e., make a charge against) your Account in the amount you specify and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, to your Account as may be necessary to make the contribution and to correct any error. Your Account will show a separate transaction for the contribution to the Campaign. Once you complete a transaction on the Website, your authorization to debit or charge your Account for this specific contribution shall remain in full force. Your contribution is considered approved when you receive an online confirmation. In Case of Errors or Questions about Your Contribution If you dispute anything related to how your contribution was processed, you must contact the Campaign. You agree to contact the Campaign as soon as possible if you believe that an error has occurred, or if there has been unauthorized use of your Account. Using this system does not guarantee or improve the chances of a Campaign receiving public funds through the Campaign Finance Program. We are not responsible for any Website, vendor, third-party, contributor, or campaign errors that might make a particular contribution ineligible for public matching funds pursuant to the New York City Campaign Finance Program. Limits on Use You must be the person authorized to make a contribution using the credit or debit card information provided to the Campaign on the Website. You agree not to use the Website in an amount that will exceed the funds or available credit line in your Account. If you do, the Campaign has no obligation to complete the transaction and you agree that the Campaign may debit your Account for its payment processor’s returned item fee or other similar fee. Your use of your Account may be limited by your agreement with your Financial Institution and by applicable law. Neither the Campaign nor the CFB is responsible for not completing a transaction as a result of any such limit on your Account and are not responsible if your Financial Institution fails to honor any charge or debit against your Account. At the Campaign’s payment processor’s sole discretion, it may refuse to complete any transaction, which it has reason to believe is not made by you, may violate any law, rule or regulation, or if it has reasonable cause not to honor it. Communications/Verifications Communications to us via the Website or the Contribute email address shall in no way be deemed to constitute legal or official notice to the CFB, or the City of New York, its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents with respect to any existing, pending or future claim or cause of action against the CFB or the City of New York or any of its agencies, officers, employees, representatives or agents where notice is required by federal, state, or local law. Communications to the CFB or the City of New York via the Website or the Contribute email address shall not be deemed to constitute legal or official notice for any other purpose. We ask all Website users to use appropriate names and language in the name spaces, address spaces and other spaces (if any) provided on the Website. Users are prohibited from using false email addresses. Governing Law This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the City and State of New York (notwithstanding New York choice of law or conflict of law principles), and the laws of the United States, where applicable. Jurisdiction You agree that any and all claims asserted by or against the CFB or the City of New York arising under or related to this Agreement or your use of the Website shall solely be heard and determined either in the courts of the United States located in the City or in the courts of the State located in the City and County of New York. You further agree that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement, or your use of the Website, shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York. Amendments We may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time. In such event, we will post the amended Terms and Conditions on the Website. Liability Should you choose to terminate or discontinue your use of the Website, you shall nonetheless remain liable for all amounts you contributed using the Website. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that the Campaign’s payment processor may incur in order to collect any amounts you owe under these Terms and Conditions. Feedback We welcome your comments regarding the Website. Feedback can be directed to us by email to contribute@nyccfb.info . Miscellaneous This Agreement constitutes the full agreement between you and the CFB related to the use of the Website. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, all other provisions will remain in full force and effect. The CFB, and any vendors or third party contractors partnered with the CFB to provide the Website, may choose not to exercise or to delay enforcement of any  rights under this Agreement without losing them.

Luis Quero for City Council Menu  Home Volunteer Vote! Bring Dignity Back Bring Dignity Back Our Campaign Be an Activist Donation Voting Info Bringing Dignity Back to Sunset Park, Dyker Heights, Red Hook and Bath Beach Brooklyn You just want to get to work without getting stabbed or burned alive. Join the movement to ensure we take a stand against Criminals which have taken control of City Hall and our neighborhoods. "There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the streets" Fiorello LaGuardia No New Shelters or Drug Clinics These facilities have been crammed into our community with few opened in wealthier neighborhoods like Tribeca or Soho. Sunset Park alone has seen a 68% increase in Felonious Assaults and 35% increase in Rape in 2024 when compared to the last 14 years (NYPD Compstat 72 Precinct 12/29/2024 ). I will oppose all new shelters or Drug Treatment centers in our community until we implement a strategy to distribute them equitably. No more Luxury Towers. Build Housing for the Masses Luxury Towers with a couple of affordable apartments sprinkled in ensure that our Real Estate market remain inaccessible to the average New Yorker. The City should prioritize Low to Moderate Income Coop development projects when approving new commercial to residential conversions. I want to bring back Co-op housing for a renewed sense of ownership in our community. Stop Funding "Do Nothing" Non Profits & Fund Training Programs I will work to vet out nonsense non-profits and reallocate funding to programs that focus on small business incubation, vocational and technical upskilling Click here to Donate Click here to Donate
