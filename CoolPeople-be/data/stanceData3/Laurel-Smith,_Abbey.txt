Screenshot Donate to this campaign to help ReBuildUSAtoday I am a KNOW-NOTHING Republican. I KNOW-NOTHING outside the constitution. I KNOW-NOTHING except a wish to secure our BORDER. I KNOW-NOTHING but a burning will to RefocusTheCongress, RePurposeTheMilitary and ReBuildUSAtoday! So help me God as I propose a return to THE AMERICAN SYSTEM. Hi there! I am Abbey Laurel-Smith, a KNOW-NOTHING PARTY candidate running for PRESIDENT of this great country of ours as SMITHIEFORPRESIDENT 2024 I am a KNOW-NOTHING REPUBLICAN because I offer common sense.  I don’t offer a dream and I have not grown to be compromisingly insular as other established candidates fielded by the Republicans, the Democrats, the Greens and the Libertarian parties. I will use your tax to encourage innovations, promote American industries and re-invigorate economically depressed communities all over the country. Subsidies, aids, sovereign grants and loans would be spend at home, as I will not only be seeing to be making internal improvements to our aging infrastructures, I will use it to build an economic system where the man who puts the land to use – through farming or mining, reigns over the man who’s main aim is to hold onto a built structure. Penal or paternal? I say paternal! Americans need to be taken care of, not neglected and certainly not punished. America’s State Department and the Foreign Secretary’s office will be reverted back to how it was originally set up – given back to the control of the Methodist and Baptist churches. All in all, penal or paternal? I say paternal! Americans need to be taken care of, not neglected and certainly not punished anymore than we all are as at now.

SmithieForMayor NYC 2021 Trust in me to ReBuildNewYorkCity Toggle Sidebar About “Smithie” Abbey Laurel-Smith Popularly known as “Smithie” Abbey Laurel-Smith, a Radical Republican and a U.S. Presidential candidate in 2016, 2020 and will be in 2024. He was an Independent mayoral candidate for the city of New York in 2013, 2017, and will be again this November, 2021. “Smithie” is the founder of The Pilgrims Alliance Party of America (La Alianza Peregrinos)- an FEC registered and recognized third political party in the United States.  He also started a set of non-partisan “ReBuild” hybrid PACs’ – ReBuildUSAtoday, ReBuildUKtoday, ReBuildCanada and ReBuildAustralia, and ReBuildNewYorkCity as a way to enable grass root demand for total infrastructure update, energize a call to embrace technology and the new age of clean and sustainable energy for the common good of all. As a self described “pruning hook” politician, Smithie never believed in raising property or sales taxes on a few notable others – when we have millions of other options to explore. And as a reconstructionist, Smithie said, “I believe in General Ulysses Grant. I trust in what he said about reconstruction, the general welfare of the poor and less fortunate Americans in his memoir of 1885.” With this in mind, Ladies and Gentlemen, do not be too surprised if I say, “my main focus – if elected into a public office, will be to use General Grant’s view of duty and care for every single American, to revive the health of New York city, the economy of the rust belt states, the gulf coast states, California, and farming communities in the western states – all of whom have been neglected by past Presidents for the past twenty five years.” “My goal is to ReBuildNewYorkCity and ReBuildUSAtoday – through these communities. Re-enegize low income and economically depressed areas in these and in other areas across America, with a green but sustainable plan. I plan to update aging infrastructures nationwide, strengthen the middle class, boost small businesses, and make certain a future for our millennials. And I will do it by synthesizing ways of dealing with “climate change” for the economic benefit of all. And I will do it according to what was in the book of Genesis 1:26 and 1 Thessalonians 5:21. By keeping in line with the American constitution, the Bible – if I may say, my party’s charter and bylaws, Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand here today to present a brief insight into my green but sustainable plan. By focusing on climate change and material technology alone, a green but sustainable plan will not only improve our quality of life, it will boost the current economy ten times better than what we have at the moment. And this is because I see climate change as a key actor that not only touches upon us all, I see it as an actor that affect services, affect our distribution network and the effectiveness of how we interact within and outside these network. For now, my goal is to set New York city straight, do what was done after the American civil war and the great depression era to get New York city back on track, to Reform the NYPD, build affordable housing, create jobs, solve problem of homelessness in public places and in public schools, set up a public healthcare and a universal insurance plan for the all in the city, put a freeze property tax and rent hike, then boost small businesses as a way to maintain a sustainable economy for the next fifty years.” Once featured in WSJ, the New York Times and at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Abbey Laurel-Smith started life as a professional artist, and a pseudo song writer with two BBC live performance credits to his name. He is also a celebrated poet, a script writer of military action adventure stories and an avid blogger/publisher of unedited line(s) of thought. He lives and works in New York city, and is currently busy setting up his political party (The PILGRIMS Alliance Party [La Alianza Peregrinos] and ReBuildUSAtoday) across the United States by advocating on behalf of the general public. “We must never be silent about issues that affect us all. Time is right for all to be engaged rather than leave the playing field to pressure groups or those serving partisan interests. Time is tight, but do-able if we have to restructure our homes, reinforce our fences, then adjust to face up to future challenges.” Writing about his works, William Zimmer, a contributing critic to the New York Times, claimed they were a testimony to “a constant ability to coherently shift from feelings to facts, from poetry to painting without a sense of disruption.” Another critic, Nina Korman of Miami New Times, claimed his works were “more than a form of spring cleaning…” Please do not hesitate to show support and tell others about SMITHIE, The PILGRIMS Alliance Party of America or La Alinaza Peregrinos – the first ever Latino party in America.
