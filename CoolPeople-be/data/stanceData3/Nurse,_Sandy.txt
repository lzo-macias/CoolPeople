New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Prime Sponsor Agenda # Agenda Note Name Type Summary Action Result Action Details Multimedia Int 0762-2024 * Rafael Salamanca, Jr. Proposed Int. No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service.

Brooks-Powers Amended and Coupled on GO Flash flood preparedness outreach and evacuation guidance. Introduction This bill would require New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) to disseminate localized emergency preparedness materials in locations that are prone to flash floods, in order to increase public awareness as to the appropriate responses by members of the public to flash flood risks and to increase registration for an emergency notification system. Such efforts would involve outreach conduct in-person and via mass mailings, and target locations selected with consideration of: (i) a history of flash flood events; and (iii) the prevalence of subgrade dwellings. Additionally, NYCEM would be required to develop guidance for facilitating safe evacuation before flash flood emergencies.

This would be led by a Deputy Mayor in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, and any other agency with relevant experience and expertise. The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The report would recommend a design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with city requirements. The agency would also post a comprehensive online map of all public bathrooms in the City.

Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY Not available Int 0168-2024 A Amanda Farías Amended and Coupled on GO Department of investigation’s oversight of the police department use of surveillance technology. Introduction The Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act was enacted by City Council in 2020 and requires the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate and report on surveillance technologies used by the Department. This legislation would add new provisions to the law which would require that the NYPD, upon request, provide the Department of Investigation (DOI) with an itemized list of all surveillance technologies currently used by the Department, and provide information on all data access and retention policies for data collected by such technologies. In addition, the legislation requires that the NYPD provide DOI with semiannual updates on all newly acquired or discontinued surveillance technologies and updates to any data access and retention policies established in recently executed contracts for surveillance technologies. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 0233-2024 A Crystal Hudson Amended and Coupled on GO Establishment of a police department policy for using facial recognition technology and regular audits to ensure compliance. Introduction This legislation would require the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to publish on its website a written policy that establishes procedures and regulations for the Department’s use of facial recognition technologies. The legislation would also require that the NYPD conduct an annual audit of the Department’s use of facial recognition technology, share the findings of such audit with the Department of Investigation, and post such findings on the Department’s website. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 0480-2024 A Julie Won Amended and Coupled on GO Police department transparency in the use of surveillance technology. Introduction The Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act was enacted by the City Council in 2020 and requires the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate and report on surveillance technologies used by the Department. This legislation would clarify language in existing law to ensure increased transparency in NYPD’s required “Impact and Use Policies” (IUPs), specifically requiring: (1) that NYPD publishes IUPs for each distinct surveillance technology used by the Department; (2) that such IUPs fully identify each external entity by name that receives data gathered from such technology; (3) that such IUPs report on specific safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized dissemination of surveillance data; and (4) that such IUPs disclose evaluation of potential disparate impacts on protected groups arising from the NYPD’s use of such technologies.

Adams Disbursement of a percentage of awards to non-profit organizations for contracts immediately upon registration by the comptroller. Introduction This bill would require the Procurement Policy Board to promulgate rules requiring the immediate disbursement of 80 percent of a fiscal year’s contract funds for agency contracts with non-profit organizations for goods, services or construction upon registration by the Comptroller and upon the start of each subsequent fiscal year, and to establish a process to recover funds for which the agency does not ultimately receive and accept the agreed-upon goods, services or construction.

Not available Not available Int 1249-2025 * Justin L. Brannan Requiring agency corrective action plans for retroactive contract registration. Introduction This bill would require city agencies to submit annual reports on contract registration during the previous fiscal year. An agency would be required to submit a corrective action plan by January 1 if it: (1) registered 100 or more contracts or contracts valued at over $10 million in the previous fiscal year; and (2) more than 30 percent of its contracts or contract value were registered 90 days or more after their start dates. Such corrective action plans would need to analyze the causes of delays, specify improvements to be made, include implementation timelines, and set performance targets. The city chief procurement officer would be required to submit an annual report to the Mayor and Council analyzing citywide trends in the effectiveness of these corrective action plans.

Introduction This bill would codify New York City’s (“City” or “NYC”) cooling center program. The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.

Oversight Not available Not available Int 0408-2024 * Public Advocate Jumaane Williams Creating a division within the department of small business services to assist street vendors and requiring the commissioner of small business services to update the department’s programs to facilitate street vendor access. Introduction This bill would create a Division of Street Vendor Assistance within the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to assist street vendors. The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors. Further, the Commissioner would be required to annually submit to the Speaker and the Mayor, and publish on the SBS website, a report on the updating of SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations and a report on the Division’s assistance of street vendors.

Introduction This bill would increase the number of food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses available each year for five years, and then it would lift the cap on food vendor supervisory licenses and general vendor licenses. This bill would also expand training to include information related to the particular vending restrictions of the license holder. Not available Not available Int 1164-2025 * Joann Ariola Requiring an interagency portal to track street vending enforcement. Introduction This bill would require the Office of Street Vendor Enforcement (OSVE) to create a portal that would allow all agencies enforcing street vending laws and regulations to share enforcement-related information. OSVE would also ensure that each enforcing agency has the capability to verify the authenticity of vendor licenses. Not available Not available Int 1251-2025 * Amanda Farías Issuing supervisory licenses to mobile food vendors. Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.

Not available Not available Not available Int 1251-2025 * Amanda Farías   Issuing supervisory licenses to mobile food vendors. Introduction Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.
This bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.   Not available Not available Not available

Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

No. 694-A Long-term citywide bathroom strategy and to make other technical changes. Introduction This bill would create a permanent, long-term strategic planning process for establishing and maintaining a citywide public bathroom network. This would be led by a Deputy Mayor in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, and any other agency with relevant experience and expertise. The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The report would recommend a design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with city requirements. The agency would also post a comprehensive online map of all public bathrooms in the City.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

To assist Council Members and residents in understanding what is important to people in their neighborhood, we have initiated a data driven approach, to serve New Yorkers better. We have brought together a variety of data sources ( 311 , Constituent Services , Census ) to understand what New Yorkers care about and how they live in their neighborhoods and city-wide. This strategy goes hand in hand with the important intuitive and nuanced understanding Council Members and residents have about our neighborhoods, to form a fuller picture of what matters most to residents. 311 Calls and Requests NYC 311 provides access to non-emergency City services and information about City government programs.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more?

We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

The bill mandates a goal of 100 Megawatts (MW) on city-owned buildings by 2025, and expands the target to 150MW on buildings and other public properties by 2030. The bill was introduced just in time for Climate Week NYC, and demonstrates the Council’s clear commitment to addressing the climate crisis and investing in a just and clean energy future. The bill builds on and codifies previous goals outlined in OneNYC and again in the latest PlaNYC, to ensure the administration is on track to meet the city’s clean energy goals. The City must be aggressive in urgently and equitably meeting our climate goals. NYC can catalyze good union labor jobs by leveraging federal opportunities to fund solar. The City can address environmental injustices by prioritizing investments in disadvantaged communities. The bill is supported by Climate Jobs New York and Climate Works for All. “The climate crisis is truly at a breaking point and necessitates investments in solutions faster than we ever have before,” said Council Member Sandy Nurse. “It is madness to wait any longer to install solar power for clean renewable energy on NYC buildings. We must rapidly draw down our use of fossil fuels at every possible opportunity. Not doing so puts our city and entire younger generations in extreme danger.” “Climate change’s effects are alarmingly more visible every day, and the longer we wait to act, the less of a chance we have to change the tides. New York City has the potential to lead the nation in carbon emission reduction and climate action while providing green union jobs to a labor market that is ready to work. This bill is one step in that direction,” said Council Member Carmen De La Rosa . “We commend Council Member Nurse for taking the lead to codify the much needed goal of installing 100MW of solar systems on public buildings by 2025 and 150MW by 2030. This would help NYC rapidly scale up sustainable and reliable energy systems to meet the interrelated crises of climate change, public health, and social inequality” said Shravanthi Kanekal, Resiliency Planner at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance and co-coordinator of the Climate Works for All coalition. “This is common-sense legislation that will create green union jobs, deliver renewable energy to communities citywide, and take another step forward in building Green, Healthy Schools,” said Lucas Shapiro, Interim Executive Director for ALIGN, co-coordinators of the Climate Works for All coalition . “Our relentless climate crisis demands urgency and action, and we are proud to work with CM Nurse to envision an equitable, sustainable future for our schools and all other public buildings across our city.” “In the face of the climate crisis, our council is taking bold steps towards a cleaner, more resilient future. If passed, our city will produce 100 megawatts of clean electricity through solar photovoltaic systems on city buildings by 2025, and by 2030, we’ll reach 150 megawatts, proving that we’re committed to environmental stewardship even as others threaten our climate progress. We’re not just installing solar panels; we’re prioritizing environmental justice, ensuring that all communities have equal access to the benefits of clean energy, reduced energy costs, and green job opportunities, while also protecting workers’ rights with project labor agreements. This initiative represents a comprehensive commitment to a greener, fairer, and more sustainable city, and we invite everyone to join us in this transformative journey.” said Rami Dinnawi, Environmental Justice Campaign & Policy Manager at El Puente. “Putting solar on the thousands of city-owned buildings will make New York City a leader in reducing our carbon footprint. If done right, this legislation could lead to the creation of thousands of good jobs and an entry into a lifetime career for young workers and workers of color,” said Gary LaBarbera, President of The New York State Building Trades and Principal Officer of Climate Jobs NY. “Investing in clean energy to power our public buildings will reduce New York City’s energy costs while improving building energy efficiencies. New York can take advantage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the environmental bond act to help defray the cost of installing solar on our public buildings while creating thousands of good union jobs,” said Vincent Alvarez, President of the New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO and principal officer of Climate Jobs  NY. “We applaud Councilmember Nurse for introducing legislation to accelerate the transition to solar on New York’s public buildings prioritizing New York City’s public schools. This is an important first step in making every New York City public school building a clean and healthy place to learn and to work in addition to creating thousands of good union green jobs.  Extreme weather events like the recent wildfires remind us how urgent it is we take immediate action for a just transition to renewable energy. Let’s invest in responsible solutions to build a sustainable and just future,” said Lenore Friedlaender, Executive Director of Climate Jobs NY. “Maximizing public solar to power New York City is a critical component in bringing down our emissions and tackling the climate crisis. I’m proud to support Council Member Nurse and her legislation to bring more solar power to our public buildings,” said Council Member Lincoln Restler. BACKGROUND: New York City can lead the way in the transition to a renewable energy future by prioritizing solar energy installation on city-owned buildings and other public properties. In 2014, the City announced the goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050 (known as 80×50), and committed to installing 100 MW of solar energy on public buildings by 2025. The primary City agency responsible for our public sector transition to renewable energy is the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The DCAS Division of Energy Management leads the City’s energy conservation and sustainability efforts. According to the 2022 City of New York Municipal Solar Readiness Assessment report, DCAS oversees more than 10,000 utility accounts for city government agencies across 4,000 public buildings. It implements creative solutions to reduce energy consumption, promote energy efficiency in public buildings, and to generate clean energy on City-owned properties. This is a moment New York City can go big—enlisting federal, state and city support and building on earlier work to put solar on some New York City schools, public land, parking lots, industrial facilities, and more. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes over $350 billion of investment in clean energy and climate change mitigation, and extended the renewable energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to municipal governments for the first time in history. Furthermore, the City can use energy savings from these solar installations to reinvest into our communities. New York City buildings also need investments to become “solar-ready,” for example many school buildings are in need of basic repairs and upgrades, including deteriorating rooftops and outdated electrical grids. School buildings should be healthy and safe for students and staff and be a model for carbon free buildings in the effort to combat climate change. As of July 2022, DCAS has a total installed solar photovoltaic capacity of 16.7 MW across 115 city-owned buildings, with another 46.3 MW of solar capacity currently in development. While New York City has made progress in meeting solar targets, there is more work to be done to ensure we are leading in the transition to a renewable energy future and centering workers and communities.

Not only are we engaging constituents and directly incorporating their concerns into our work, but we're also partnering with local and citywide movements to build policies and envision transformative legislation that we, collectively, can draft and ultimately pass once elected. How We Created This Policy Action Plan This policy platform is the result of these efforts and reflects our vision for a better community, a better City. It is, as all policy platforms should be, a living document, one that is and will continue to be informed by movements as we collectively struggle for a better world. Our Platform HOUSING FOR ALL NEW YORKERS Housing is a human right, and no one should be without a home. Council District 37 has the highest rate of youth who are housing insecure or homeless, some of the highest rates of women and children going into local shelters, and the highest number of homes on the city’s tax lien sale. My top priority is to push for a NYC Homes Guarantee to win housing for all and treat land and housing as a public good, not as a commodity.

This inequality is replicated in our school system, and must end by guaranteeing quality education for all. We need to support the next generation of leaders and innovators through providing free higher education to every New Yorker who seeks it. As an activist and organizer, I have been fighting against student debt and the high cost of higher education for years. In the Council, I will continue that fight.

Prisons, torture, and isolation should not be our societal practices. I believe our communities can be safe without having armed officers respond to the majority of crises. Whether it’s Council Members or District Attorneys , all public officials have a responsibility to decarcerate our city. We must divest from the systems that harm us, and invest in the public services and programs that promote healthy communities such as robust family services, drug rehabilitation centers, strong job and workforce development programs, anti-violence programs and experts, and real investments in mental health facilities and services.

Jan 30, 2020 New York, NY The de Blasio Administration today launched NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island, building on the Administration’s commitment to guaranteeing health care for all New Yorkers. The program will seek to enroll 15,000 members in Brooklyn and Staten Island within the first six months of launching. Over 13,000 New Yorkers have enrolled in NYC Care since its initial launch in the Bronx in August 2019, surpassing the program’s original goal of 10,000 in the first six months. “In New York City, we believe that healthcare is a human right,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio . “Already, NYC Care has brought 13,000 people in the Bronx access to quality, affordable health care. By expanding to Staten Island and Brooklyn, we can help even more New Yorkers get the care they need.” NYC Care is the new health care access program operated by NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) for New Yorkers who are not eligible for insurance or who cannot afford it. Since its launch in the Bronx, NYC Care has already begun to dramatically change the way the City’s public health system connects people to primary, preventive and specialty care. To date, NYC Care’s 13,000 members have had over 27,000 provider visits, with over 20,000 prescriptions filled during new, extended pharmacy hours. Beginning today, NYC Care membership will now be open to anyone who has lived in the city for at least six months, lives or wants to seek care in Brooklyn or Staten Island, and is currently uninsured. All new NYC Care members will be offered a primary care appointment within two weeks from enrollment. H+H patient care locations in Brooklyn and Staten have added new evening and weekend hours to accommodate members. NYC Care applicants and members also have access to a 24/7 customer assistance line where they can ask questions about NYC Care and speak to an on-call clinician for all of their needs, including prescription refills. In an effort to reach more New Yorkers eligible for NYC Care, nine community-based organizations (CBOs) will receive seven-month contracts through a partnership between NYC H+H, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) and the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City to conduct culturally appropriate outreach to prospective NYC Care members in Brooklyn and Staten Island. The nine community-based organizations – African Refuge, Brighton Neighborhood Association, Arab-American Family Support Center, Council of Peoples Organization (COPO), Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island, Make the Road New York, Mixteca Organization, Project Hospitality, and Single Stop – were selected through a request for proposal process. A total of 23 full-time outreach workers will conduct grassroots outreach in order to identify, engage, and refer uninsured New Yorkers for screening and enrollment in NYC Care. Beginning today, these CBOS will begin outreach efforts in 20 languages, such as Spanish, Russian, Haitian Creole, Polish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Arabic. In addition, H+H is conducting a borough-wide multilingual public awareness campaign, including public transportation, the Staten Island Ferry and train, in-store posters, radio and street outreach in top targeted communities. There will also be significant multilingual digital advertisements and ethnic and community media engagement to reach those eligible for NYC Care. As part of the campaign, New Yorkers can also learn more about the program by calling 646-NYC-CARE as well as through a dedicated website at nyccare.nyc where they can download brochures and other materials available in multiples languages. “NYC Care is a pillar of the de Blasio administration’s commitment to health care for all New Yorkers, and today, we are unlocking access to health care for thousands of people in Brooklyn and Staten Island,” said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Dr. Raul Perea-Henze . “With more than 13,000 members enrolled in the Bronx, NYC Care is making an impact for New Yorkers who need high-quality and affordable care, especially our immigrant communities. Everyone eligible in Brooklyn and Staten Island is urged to enroll today, and to tell their families, friends and neighbors about NYC Care. I thank NYC Health + Hospitals, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, and all our community partners for the ongoing success of NYC Care as we work to bring the program to every borough by the end of this year.” “Starting today, New Yorkers in both Brooklyn and Staten Island will have much-needed access to high-quality, affordable, preventive care,” said Mitchell Katz, MD, President and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals . “This furthers our vision to fundamentally change the way our health care system connects those who are not eligible for health insurance to the high-quality health care we deliver to thousands of New Yorkers every day.” “The launch of NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island invites members regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay to use our system in a different way. All New Yorkers are entitled to receive primary and preventive and specialty care before it is too late and they must use the emergency department,” said NYC Care Executive Director Marielle Kress . “I am excited to continue our work with trusted organizations to reach thousands of New Yorkers who need access to care in Brooklyn and Staten Island.” “Enrolling in NYC Care helps previously uninsured New Yorkers access primary care and prescription drugs in a timely manner, avoiding more serious and costly health problems down the line,” said Assembly Health Committee Chair Richard N. Gottfried . “There’s a clear need for the program, and I commend Mayor de Blasio, H+H, and the Office of Immigrant Affairs for extending it to patients in Brooklyn and on Staten Island. “For the many thousands of immigrants and other vulnerable New Yorkers who have been forced to forgo essential medical care because they can’t obtain or afford health insurance, the NYC Care program is nothing less than a lifesaver,” said Assembly Member Steven Cymbrowitz . “I’m pleased that the Mayor’s office is expanding this important initiative to Brooklyn, where experienced community-based organizations like the Brighton Neighborhood Association will give residents the opportunity to connect with NYC Cares without even leaving their neighborhood.” “The expansion of NYC Care to the Boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn is encouraging given the success and results taking place in the Bronx. Every new resident enrolled in the program is a step in the right direction toward ensuring every Staten Island resident has access to care. I look forward to working with health care providers in the North Shore to assure this program benefits those that need it most. Affordable, accessible health care is a human right and all efforts to extend this program for the most vulnerable who often have nowhere to go for emergency and general care will assist in the quality of life for all New Yorkers,” said Assembly Member Charles D. Fall . “New Yorkers deserve access to quality and affordable health care. The expansion of NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island means more New Yorkers will be able to prioritize preventative care and lead healthier lives. With health insurance being one of the single biggest expenses, the expansion of NYC Care is crucial to help ensure that New Yorkers will not have to think twice about going to a doctor. I welcome NYC Care to Brooklyn and applaud Mayor de Blasio and NYC Health and Hospitals for their dedication to this important issue,” said Assembly Member Joseph R. Lentol . “NYC Care is a critical step in ensuring that finances, language, or immigration status are no longer barriers to healthcare. All members of our community deserve affordable healthcare that fits with their schedules, lifestyles, and cultural needs. I look forward to working with the Mayor’s office, H + H, and community organizations like the Arab-American Family Support Center to make that a reality,” said Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon . “I want to congratulate Health + Hospitals on the expansion of the NYC Care program, which will now give thousands of Brooklynites and Staten Islanders easier access to an affordable primary care doctor and help alleviate demands in our busiest emergency rooms. As the federal administration continues to attempt to strip access to public benefits, New York City is ensuring that no one in the Five Boroughs is left behind. I look forward to working with the Mayor’s Office and H+H to ensure the continued roll out of NYC Care is successful and funded effectively,” said Council Member Carlina Rivera, Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals . “Healthcare is a human right, and that means everybody, including our immigrant neighbors. As someone who represents one of the largest and most diverse immigrant populations in the City, I see everyday the impossible choices families often make between going to a doctor or putting food on the table. NYC Care has changed that equation forever, and I cannot wait to work with local organizations, like Mixteca, the Arab-American Family Support Center, and Make the Road New York to get as many people enrolled as possible in Brooklyn,” said Council Member Carlos Menchaca, Chair of the New York City Council’s Committee on Immigration . “I am happy to see diverse community-based organizations including the Council of Peoples Organization (COPO) in my district, working collaboratively with the de Blasio Administration to ensure Brooklyn residents can access the healthcare that they need to improve their quality of life,” said Council Member Farah N. Louis . “There is nothing more important than providing hardworking New Yorkers with access to quality affordable healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status” said Council Member Mathieu Eugene . “I want to commend the de Blasio Administration and NYC Health and Hospitals on today’s launch of NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island, because I believe it will have a profound impact on our great city’s ability to provide essential healthcare services to those who need them most. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and we know of far too many cases of uninsured New Yorkers who are in need of medical treatment but cannot afford to see a doctor. With the launch of NYC Care, the City of New York is making a profound statement that we will work together to help underserved communities receive the medical resources they require, and I am most appreciative to the many community-based organizations who have worked very hard to make it a success. “Today NYC Care moves closer to its mission of being a citywide program for all uninsured New Yorkers,” said Max Hadler, Director of Health Policy at the New York Immigration Coalition . “With immigrant communities and public benefits under attack by the Trump administration, the city is reinforcing an important message that affordable health care is a right for all regardless of immigration status. We look forward to working with NYC Health + Hospitals and trusted community-based organizations to ensure that all New Yorkers know they can and should get the health services they need.” “In January 2019, Mayor de Blasio made a big commitment to New Yorkers to expand upon its already strong public health program to improve access to healthcare services for everyone, regardless of their immigration status. Today we are proud to work alongside our city and other advocates as NYC Care expands into Brooklyn and Staten Island, said Becca Telzak, Director of Health Programs at Make the Road New York . “This program has already, and will continue to, go a long way in increasing access to healthcare services for immigrants and low-income communities. At a time when immigrant communities are under attack, NYC Care stands as a symbol that all New Yorkers are welcome and valued in our city. We look forward to working with the administration and NYC Health + Hospitals to get the word out about this initiative and are looking forward to this ongoing partnership as the program is expanded citywide.” “Single Stop is proud to collaborate with New York City to bring quality, affordable healthcare to low income New Yorkers in Brooklyn. Single Stop has worked for years to help low-income families overcome barriers to economic success. Access to healthcare has consistently been one of the biggest challenges low-income households face,” said Sarah Crawford, National Director, National Director of Partnerships and Programs, Single Stop . “We commend the Mayor’s Fund, MOIA, and NYC Health + Hospitals for prioritizing the health of all New Yorkers by providing this critical service and we look forward to playing a major role in this landmark program.” “Mixteca Organization, Inc. is excited to partner with New York City’s recently introduced healthcare program, NYC Care, to inform and connect individuals to much needed healthcare services in Brooklyn, regardless of status,” said Executive Director Lorena Kourousias, Mixteca . “Serving as a critical and trusted information hub for Latinx immigrant communities, Mixteca recognizes the importance of having accessible preventative care, especially for immigrant communities. NYC Care will be an important and accessible resource for uninsured New Yorkers.” “African Refuge is proud to have been selected to participate in NYC Care. We believe, it is a wonderful health option for the more than 600,000 New Yorkers who are uninsured, under-insured and either, unemployed, employed, documented or undocumented. It takes us back to a day when families had a family doctor. Someone they could call and trust to address their health concerns without waiting unnecessarily in an emergency room for hours,” said Reverend Judy L Brown, Executive Director, African Refuge . “We commend, The Mayor, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and NYC Health + Hospitals for taking a step in the right direction to achieve an important goal for our city and country, health care not just for some, but health care for all.” “At the Council of Peoples Organization (COPO), we believe that access to affordable, quality healthcare is a fundamental human right. With NYC Care, New Yorkers will now be able to receive free or low-cost primary care from top-notch providers, all while maintaining their dignity and their wellbeing. COPO is proud to support NYC Care and will continue to advocate for the rights of all New Yorkers,” said Mohammad Razvi, CEO, Council of Peoples Organization . “NYC Care will greatly improve the lives of Staten Islanders who cannot access or afford health insurance. Rather than waiting until a health problem becomes an emergency, our community members will be able to more easily access health care services at NYC Health & Hospitals facilities, as well as critical preventive and specialty care,” – Reverend Karen Jackson, Project Hospitality’s Director of Community Initiatives . Contact: Press Office , 212-788-3339 Health Care For All: NYC Care Launches in Brooklyn and Staten Island NYC Care will be available in every borough by the end of 2020. Jan 30, 2020 New York, NY The de Blasio Administration today launched NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island, building on the Administration’s commitment to guaranteeing health care for all New Yorkers. The program will seek to enroll 15,000 members in Brooklyn and Staten Island within the first six months of launching. Over 13,000 New Yorkers have enrolled in NYC Care since its initial launch in the Bronx in August 2019, surpassing the program’s original goal of 10,000 in the first six months. “In New York City, we believe that healthcare is a human right,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio . “Already, NYC Care has brought 13,000 people in the Bronx access to quality, affordable health care. By expanding to Staten Island and Brooklyn, we can help even more New Yorkers get the care they need.” NYC Care is the new health care access program operated by NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) for New Yorkers who are not eligible for insurance or who cannot afford it. Since its launch in the Bronx, NYC Care has already begun to dramatically change the way the City’s public health system connects people to primary, preventive and specialty care. To date, NYC Care’s 13,000 members have had over 27,000 provider visits, with over 20,000 prescriptions filled during new, extended pharmacy hours. Beginning today, NYC Care membership will now be open to anyone who has lived in the city for at least six months, lives or wants to seek care in Brooklyn or Staten Island, and is currently uninsured. All new NYC Care members will be offered a primary care appointment within two weeks from enrollment. H+H patient care locations in Brooklyn and Staten have added new evening and weekend hours to accommodate members. NYC Care applicants and members also have access to a 24/7 customer assistance line where they can ask questions about NYC Care and speak to an on-call clinician for all of their needs, including prescription refills. In an effort to reach more New Yorkers eligible for NYC Care, nine community-based organizations (CBOs) will receive seven-month contracts through a partnership between NYC H+H, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) and the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City to conduct culturally appropriate outreach to prospective NYC Care members in Brooklyn and Staten Island. The nine community-based organizations – African Refuge, Brighton Neighborhood Association, Arab-American Family Support Center, Council of Peoples Organization (COPO), Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island, Make the Road New York, Mixteca Organization, Project Hospitality, and Single Stop – were selected through a request for proposal process. A total of 23 full-time outreach workers will conduct grassroots outreach in order to identify, engage, and refer uninsured New Yorkers for screening and enrollment in NYC Care. Beginning today, these CBOS will begin outreach efforts in 20 languages, such as Spanish, Russian, Haitian Creole, Polish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Arabic. In addition, H+H is conducting a borough-wide multilingual public awareness campaign, including public transportation, the Staten Island Ferry and train, in-store posters, radio and street outreach in top targeted communities. There will also be significant multilingual digital advertisements and ethnic and community media engagement to reach those eligible for NYC Care. As part of the campaign, New Yorkers can also learn more about the program by calling 646-NYC-CARE as well as through a dedicated website at nyccare.nyc where they can download brochures and other materials available in multiples languages. “NYC Care is a pillar of the de Blasio administration’s commitment to health care for all New Yorkers, and today, we are unlocking access to health care for thousands of people in Brooklyn and Staten Island,” said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Dr. Raul Perea-Henze . “With more than 13,000 members enrolled in the Bronx, NYC Care is making an impact for New Yorkers who need high-quality and affordable care, especially our immigrant communities. Everyone eligible in Brooklyn and Staten Island is urged to enroll today, and to tell their families, friends and neighbors about NYC Care. I thank NYC Health + Hospitals, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, and all our community partners for the ongoing success of NYC Care as we work to bring the program to every borough by the end of this year.” “Starting today, New Yorkers in both Brooklyn and Staten Island will have much-needed access to high-quality, affordable, preventive care,” said Mitchell Katz, MD, President and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals . “This furthers our vision to fundamentally change the way our health care system connects those who are not eligible for health insurance to the high-quality health care we deliver to thousands of New Yorkers every day.” “The launch of NYC Care in Brooklyn and Staten Island invites members regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay to use our system in a different way. All New Yorkers are entitled to receive primary and preventive and specialty care before it is too late and they must use the emergency department,” said NYC Care Executive Director Marielle Kress . “I am excited to continue our work with trusted organizations to reach thousands of New Yorkers who need access to care in Brooklyn and Staten Island.” “Enrolling in NYC Care helps previously uninsured New Yorkers access primary care and prescription drugs in a timely manner, avoiding more serious and costly health problems down the line,” said Assembly Health Committee Chair Richard N. Gottfried . “There’s a clear need for the program, and I commend Mayor de Blasio, H+H, and the Office of Immigrant Affairs for extending it to patients in Brooklyn and on Staten Island. “For the many thousands of immigrants and other vulnerable New Yorkers who have been forced to forgo essential medical care because they can’t obtain or afford health insurance, the NYC Care program is nothing less than a lifesaver,” said Assembly Member Steven Cymbrowitz . “I’m pleased that the Mayor’s office is expanding this important initiative to Brooklyn, where experienced community-based organizations like the Brighton Neighborhood Association will give residents the opportunity to connect with NYC Cares without even leaving their neighborhood.” “The expansion of NYC Care to the Boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn is encouraging given the success and results taking place in the Bronx. Every new resident enrolled in the program is a step in the right direction toward ensuring every Staten Island resident has access to care. I look forward to working with health care providers in the North Shore to assure this program benefits those that need it most. Affordable, accessible health care is a human right and all efforts to extend this program for the most vulnerable who often have nowhere to go for emergency and general care will assist in the quality of life for all New Yorkers,” said Assembly Member Charles D.

TeachHub Employees Submit Home Learning Programs Community Schools NYC Community Schools Beginning in fall 2014, 45 schools became NYC Community Schools as part of an attendance-improvement and drop-out-prevention grant in partnership with United Way NYC. In School Year 2022-23 there are 421 Community Schools across every district in NYC, funded through city, state and federal dollars. Community Schools support: the whole child the child’s family learning both inside and outside of the classroom Community School Success Read about our results in a new report from the RAND Corporation which proves that NYC Community Schools are effective in increasing graduation rates and student achievement, and in reducing chronic absenteeism and disciplinary incidents. What Happens in a Community School? The more time students spend at school, the more they learn. And so Community Schools stay open after school and over the summer. During that time they may offer: Arts Sports Music lessons Book clubs Robotics Healthy students attend more days of school. That’s why school-based health services include: Vision care/free glasses Medical care Dental care Mental health counselors When students feel supported and welcome, they thrive in school. That’s why community schools have more adults who can: Mentor Tutor Make connections with parents and families When students see learning as a life-long skill, they stick with it more. That’s why we offer parents and families: Adult education classes Training for parents leaders Access to social services Adult education programs and social services provide parents and caregivers with skills and resources to improve their lives. Each school has a lead Community-Based Organization (CBO) partner that coordinates and delivers services. Every school also has a Community School Director, who is a CBO employee. Ways to Get Involved Parents Attend your schools Parent Association/Parent Teacher Association Meeting(s) or run for a position. Meet with your Parent Coordinator to discuss upcoming opportunities to get involved, like parent workshops or your Community School Forum in the spring. Contact the Parent Empowerment Liaison for your district about upcoming parent leadership development opportunities.

The near economic collapse was a result of unfortunate patterns and practices here in the city. Recovery would depend on the revival of a local economy that was already being rocked by a decline of manufacturing jobs, and by how it dealt with middle-class suburb migration. Consequently, the housing market took a drastic turn when we failed to put in place initiatives that would promote fiscally responsible infrastructure driven by a partnership between the public and private sectors. Though many believe that the downturn in housing stock was a result of overly progressive public policies, the real decline was caused by an industry-driven private sector, and our failure to create real mandates for affordable housing throughout the five boroughs. Because of that failure, New York, including but not limited to New York City, has experienced high levels of gentrification and displacement. As a result of housing and land use policies that too often prioritize profit over people, many Brooklynites are no longer able to afford living in neighborhoods where they were born and raised. One policy that is fueling gentrification is the 421-a tax abatement program. The 421-a program is available to almost any new residential building of more than five units. Projects that qualify for the exemption must set aside 20 percent of their units as “affordable.” This relic of 1970s New York was intended to encourage big real estate to build affordable housing. However, we have learned that these tax breaks do not spur affordable housing , but instead accelerate gentrification by saturating local housing markets with luxury housing units and driving up housing costs while providing a small number of “affordable” units that are often only affordable to families earning over $100,000. Fortunately, New York City has two programs that will put the private sector back in a position where the benefit of creating new and real affordable housing will be shared proportionately with working families. The programs — the Extremely Low & Low-Income Affordability program and the New Housing Opportunities Program — are under the supervision of the New York City Housing Development Corporation. These programs provide benefits for lower income families that range from setting aside units for formerly homeless applicants, to mandating a number of affordable units based on 30 to 60 percent of Area Median Income, all while providing below-market mortgages for developers constructing moderate income rental housing. Both of these programs serve as prime examples of our city’s desire to build affordable and sustainable housing for all. However, when unsustainable tax abatement programs like 421-a remain an option to lending institutions, we leave developers to their own devices and, subsequently, our worst outcomes as a city. 421-a costs New York City over $1.5 billion per year in lost property tax revenue to fund housing units unaffordable to the majority of New York City residents. The program also fails to meet the ultimate and real-time demands to build income-targeted housing that is sufficient for the homeless and city residents in need, putting the demand for profit over everything else. In fact, the New York City Independent Budget Office looked at a case study of a Midtown luxury condo building in 2015 and found that its 421-a benefits cost the city $65 million while the project created a mere 66 affordable units off-site in the Bronx. Had the development simply not received 421-a benefits, the IBO estimates that the city could have used that revenue to fund the construction of over 300 units in the Bronx by way of cash grants. As long as we keep tax abatement programs like 421-a in place, the priority to efficiently build sustainable, supportive and truly affordable housing will remain secondary to leveraging housing for corporate profit. The recent Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act has been the most robust legislative response to the rental crises in the history of the state. It is one that ensures all involved in the industry of affordable housing make the necessary changes in their practices to break the cycle of poverty. Similar to the task we faced in the 1970s, we must now decide the fate of roughly one million-plus city renters and their families. From luxury deregulation, capital improvement removal and preferential rent elimination, the desperate need for structural changes is obvious. However, the stage is set to take that next critical step — a step that will run counter to arguments made by corporate interests and attempt to create a new resolve for those who want to call our great state home.

In 2019, Ms. Rosa sat in her apartment where she’s lived for 40 years, worrying about the strange noises she was hearing at night and hoping no one was planning to break in. She had just commuted from the hotel where she was sleeping after illegal construction in her bathroom forced her out of her apartment temporarily. Over 80 years old, she just wanted to be home. Ms. Rosa lives at 149 Irving Ave., owned by Ink Property Group , in Bushwick. One half of the six-unit rent stabilized building has been vacant over two years (one family who had been evicted currently lives in a shelter while their apartment remains empty). The empty apartment next to Ms. Rosa looked almost post-apocalyptic after a leak ran for weeks. When city inspectors finally did gain access to the vacant unit, they wouldn’t enter for fear of their own safety: the black mold coated the walls like paint. Ms. Rosa worried about her health and the health of her neighbors. While New York City is experiencing a severe shortage of affordable housing and increase in homelessness both before and amidst the pandemic, landlords are holding thousands of affordable units off the market. Many apartments have been warehoused for so long that they have deteriorated to the danger of adjacent neighbors. Tenants are surrounded by apartments left to rot, filled with debris, mold and pests. This is the paradox of warehoused apartments in a city of 92,000 homeless people. CityViews are readers’ opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today! The consequences are dire. The pandemic has amplified the homelessness crisis already in progress. Some tenants are being driven out of their homes as overcrowded rooms and shelters lend themselves to spreading COVID-19. Those experiencing homelessness are dying at a 61 percent higher rate than the general population while the city is simultaneously experiencing one of the biggest vacancy rates in years. This is unconscionable. We can no longer afford to allow housing to sit unused while COVID-19 threatens our city and state. Meanwhile, some landlords have intentionally created mostly-empty buildings, leaving remaining tenants surrounded by warehoused units. In one 15-building portfolio in the Lower East Side, over half of the 281 apartments have been sitting vacant for more than four years. Not coincidentally, many of those apartments are rent-regulated. Some were gutted as the new owner planned to convert them into market-rate, luxury, 5 and 6 floor walk-ups. Others remain habitable but empty. In north Brooklyn, a few rent-regulated tenants survive in their otherwise vacant rent-stabilized building. But why are landlords choosing to leave so many apartments vacant? Doesn’t this go against all sense of good business? After NY State’s Housing and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, landlords found new ways to deregulate apartments and raise rents. If two vacant apartments are combined—commonly now called “Frankensteined”—landlords are able to raise the base rent to whatever they like, essentially deregulating the units. Some hope that remaining tenants in near-empty buildings would clear out, so multiple apartments could be combined or to fully demolish and renovate the building into new, unregulated units. Data pulled from the Department of Buildings shows that 341 applications to combine two apartments were approved since January 1, 2019, meaning that almost 700 rent stabilized units were permanently lost due to this practice. Other landlords are simply waiting for the tenant-friendly legislative body in Albany to shift. According to a Real Deal article published in September , many landlords “don’t blame Covid as much as they do the new law’s limits on how much landlords can be reimbursed for renovations. Some landlords also say they are reluctant to fill vacant apartments because they think state legislators might change the law in their favor.” As the COVID-19 crisis drags on with no end in sight, more and more units are being vacated. A Crain’s article this month reports that vacancies in Manhattan reached a record high, with close to 16,000 available to rent. There are tangible solutions. The End Warehousing Coalition, which came together to address this crisis, is inspired by cities around the world responding to the problem of warehoused units.  Barcelona is forcing landlords to rent out empty apartments within thirty days or face the possibility of having the dwellings seized by the city. Los Angeles is exploring a tax on vacant apartments, which would push landlords to rent rather than sit on their housing stock. More and more creative solutions are emerging worldwide to ensure housing for all during a pandemic. New York should be a leader in this movement. Our coalition is working with the New York City Council and the New York State government to advance legislation which would create a registry of vacant units, mandate inspections of those units, and fine landlords who are holding affordable apartments empty. Money generated from those fines could feed into a voucher program to fund housing for the homeless. Another proposed policy would automatically reduce residential rents to the federally-determined fair market rates and require landlords to accept housing vouchers from low-income and homeless applicants. We need an affordable solution for New Yorkers. Our tax money should not support warehousing any affordable units, especially in private buildings that receive government subsidies. New York City and state can and must develop immediate policy solutions to this crisis.

She had just commuted from the hotel where she was sleeping after illegal construction in her bathroom forced her out of her apartment temporarily. Over 80 years old, she just wanted to be home. Ms. Rosa lives at 149 Irving Ave., owned by Ink Property Group , in Bushwick. One half of the six-unit rent stabilized building has been vacant over two years (one family who had been evicted currently lives in a shelter while their apartment remains empty). The empty apartment next to Ms. Rosa looked almost post-apocalyptic after a leak ran for weeks. When city inspectors finally did gain access to the vacant unit, they wouldn’t enter for fear of their own safety: the black mold coated the walls like paint. Ms. Rosa worried about her health and the health of her neighbors. While New York City is experiencing a severe shortage of affordable housing and increase in homelessness both before and amidst the pandemic, landlords are holding thousands of affordable units off the market. Many apartments have been warehoused for so long that they have deteriorated to the danger of adjacent neighbors. Tenants are surrounded by apartments left to rot, filled with debris, mold and pests. This is the paradox of warehoused apartments in a city of 92,000 homeless people. The consequences are dire. The pandemic has amplified the homelessness crisis already in progress. Some tenants are being driven out of their homes as overcrowded rooms and shelters lend themselves to spreading COVID-19. Those experiencing homelessness are dying at a 61 percent higher rate than the general population while the city is simultaneously experiencing one of the biggest vacancy rates in years. This is unconscionable. We can no longer afford to allow housing to sit unused while COVID-19 threatens our city and state. Meanwhile, some landlords have intentionally created mostly-empty buildings, leaving remaining tenants surrounded by warehoused units. In one 15-building portfolio in the Lower East Side, over half of the 281 apartments have been sitting vacant for more than four years. Not coincidentally, many of those apartments are rent-regulated. Some were gutted as the new owner planned to convert them into market-rate, luxury, 5 and 6 floor walk-ups. Others remain habitable but empty. In north Brooklyn, a few rent-regulated tenants survive in their otherwise vacant rent-stabilized building. But why are landlords choosing to leave so many apartments vacant? Doesn’t this go against all sense of good business? After NY State’s Housing and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, landlords found new ways to deregulate apartments and raise rents. If two vacant apartments are combined—commonly now called “Frankensteined”—landlords are able to raise the base rent to whatever they like, essentially deregulating the units. Some hope that remaining tenants in near-empty buildings would clear out, so multiple apartments could be combined or to fully demolish and renovate the building into new, unregulated units. Data pulled from the Department of Buildings shows that 341 applications to combine two apartments were approved since January 1, 2019, meaning that almost 700 rent stabilized units were permanently lost due to this practice. Other landlords are simply waiting for the tenant-friendly legislative body in Albany to shift. According to a Real Deal article published in September , many landlords “don’t blame Covid as much as they do the new law’s limits on how much landlords can be reimbursed for renovations. Some landlords also say they are reluctant to fill vacant apartments because they think state legislators might change the law in their favor.” As the COVID-19 crisis drags on with no end in sight, more and more units are being vacated. A Crain’s article this month reports that vacancies in Manhattan reached a record high, with close to 16,000 available to rent. There are tangible solutions. The End Warehousing Coalition, which came together to address this crisis, is inspired by cities around the world responding to the problem of warehoused units.  Barcelona is forcing landlords to rent out empty apartments within thirty days or face the possibility of having the dwellings seized by the city. Los Angeles is exploring a tax on vacant apartments, which would push landlords to rent rather than sit on their housing stock. More and more creative solutions are emerging worldwide to ensure housing for all during a pandemic. New York should be a leader in this movement. Our coalition is working with the New York City Council and the New York State government to advance legislation which would create a registry of vacant units, mandate inspections of those units, and fine landlords who are holding affordable apartments empty. Money generated from those fines could feed into a voucher program to fund housing for the homeless. Another proposed policy would automatically reduce residential rents to the federally-determined fair market rates and require landlords to accept housing vouchers from low-income and homeless applicants. We need an affordable solution for New Yorkers. Our tax money should not support warehousing any affordable units, especially in private buildings that receive government subsidies. New York City and state can and must develop immediate policy solutions to this crisis.

There are an enormous amount of apts vacant at the moment that are not rent regulated that are trying to be rented.  And again you want to punish landlords for that too.  Tax vacant apts?  There has been no assistance for rent apt buildings during Covid.  A time when there has been a mass exodus from nyc and a large % of tenants unable or unwilling to pay their rent. Yes, there is a homeless problem in NY, but why are you forcing private individuals to foot the bill to house them particularly those that do not get any government tax credits. There is so much talk about making housing available to low income people, yet you’ve done nothing to insure that those that are deserving get them.  There is no registry, no oversight and no qualifications for getting and keeping a rent regulated apt.  You can be a millionaire with multiple other homes, but as long as you live in your apt as your primary residence you can get and keep your regulated apt forever and then pass it on once you’re gone.   So really who is warehousing apts, the landlords or the rich tenants that will never give up their deal of the century!?

I been applying for affordable  housing lotteries in nyc for 10 yrs I have 2 children and because of this ridiculous rent rise and these ridiculous amounts of incomes this system is asking for you to make is impossible, you will just work to pay rent and nothing else you won’t even be able to afford groceries for a family of 4 with these prices and it needs to change this is 2020 we are still with this stone age methods what worked 10 yrs ago is not going to work now we need new strategies  and i can’t WAIT TILL THESE EXTREME MEASURES START TAKING ACTIONS. 0 Likes Reply NYC person Posted October 19, 2020 at 10:46 am Rochelle – you obvious do not know what it is like to run a building especially pre war buildings that were forced against the constitutional rights of Americans to provide the subsidy known as rent stabilized and rent control apartments whereby not receiving the just compensation from the government for that taking. Now history lesson aside, here is the microeconmic reality of your false accusations and unsupported rhetoric – particularly this statement “nyc landlords are cheap they don’t like to pay for the proper service in fixing their rental building they prefer to cover all the walls up with plaster, paper, and paint and just disguise them into looking like beautiful apartments when the truth is they are rotting inside with mold” if you are not an environmental engineer and have not tested the surfaces, don’t exaggerate and say without investigating that walls have rotting mold. Also exaggerating that NYC landlords are cheap is not true for all. There are many small property owners who can not afford the requirements because rents are forced to be too while maintaining inflated NYC Property taxes and insurance and utilities and while trying to provide a living wage to workers as well as employee insurance and payroll taxes. This is in addition to tenants who willfully damage apartments and cause expenses to also increase. You are taking a look at your own unfortunate situation and because you can’t catch the lucky break you think you deserve by having a government hand out, you automatically project and blame your anger on others. Why don’t you look at the people who have multiple homes who were lucky enough to get their hands on a rent regulated apartment and holding onto it to give to their family member and not letting people like you get a chance to move into them? Until you walk a  mile in someone’s shoes, then don’t assume you know what it’s like so keep your false narrative to yourself and go focus on your own life and get yourself into a better situation so you won’t continue spreading incorrect statements. 0 Likes Reply robi Posted December 30, 2020 at 10:04 pm Dude, NYC is a terrible place.

Its going to get worst. Because rent continues to go up. and race plays a part also when people go find apartment.

What needs to be done. stop saying the affordable apartments because there not for people who make under 30 thousand.

The macroeconomics of living a good life in NYC has dumbfounded me. 0 Likes nan Posted February 28, 2021 at 9:48 pm Wow. That’s just pure hatred! 0 Likes NYC person Posted October 19, 2020 at 10:46 am Rochelle – you obvious do not know what it is like to run a building especially pre war buildings that were forced against the constitutional rights of Americans to provide the subsidy known as rent stabilized and rent control apartments whereby not receiving the just compensation from the government for that taking. Now history lesson aside, here is the microeconmic reality of your false accusations and unsupported rhetoric – particularly this statement “nyc landlords are cheap they don’t like to pay for the proper service in fixing their rental building they prefer to cover all the walls up with plaster, paper, and paint and just disguise them into looking like beautiful apartments when the truth is they are rotting inside with mold” if you are not an environmental engineer and have not tested the surfaces, don’t exaggerate and say without investigating that walls have rotting mold. Also exaggerating that NYC landlords are cheap is not true for all. There are many small property owners who can not afford the requirements because rents are forced to be too while maintaining inflated NYC Property taxes and insurance and utilities and while trying to provide a living wage to workers as well as employee insurance and payroll taxes. This is in addition to tenants who willfully damage apartments and cause expenses to also increase. You are taking a look at your own unfortunate situation and because you can’t catch the lucky break you think you deserve by having a government hand out, you automatically project and blame your anger on others. Why don’t you look at the people who have multiple homes who were lucky enough to get their hands on a rent regulated apartment and holding onto it to give to their family member and not letting people like you get a chance to move into them? Until you walk a  mile in someone’s shoes, then don’t assume you know what it’s like so keep your false narrative to yourself and go focus on your own life and get yourself into a better situation so you won’t continue spreading incorrect statements. 0 Likes 0 Likes Reply robi Posted December 30, 2020 at 10:04 pm Dude, NYC is a terrible place.

Gotham Gazette The Place for New York Policy and politics Past Stories Opinion Donate Connect with us Twitter Facebook CITY CITY City Council Holds Hearing on Sexual and Reproductive Right October 27,  2020 | by Caroline Leddy City Council Member Helen Rosenthal, right (photo: John McCarten/City Council) New York City Council Members will hold an oversight hearing Wednesday on “sexual and reproductive rights in New York City” and consider a package of legislation on those subjects, at a joint hearing of the Council’s Committee on Health and Committee on Women and Gender Equity. The bills cover a wide range of issues, including access to contraception, establishing a board on gender equity in hospitals, and providing health care professionals with training on how to identify the signs of female genital mutilation. Most of the bills fall under the World Health Organization's 17 indicators of reproductive health, according to a City Council spokesperson. The hearing comes at a time where reproductive rights in the United States are again at the center of the national political conversation, amid a presidential election, the recent death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a strong supporter of abortion rights, and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has expressed opposition to abortion, to replace Ginsburg on the high court, tilting it further toward conservatives and raising concerns among pro-choice Americans that the Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling could be overturned. The National Organization for Women’s New York City chapter issued a statement soon after Justice Barrett was confirmed, signaling that women’s reproductive rights may now be at stake with her on the bench. “We're on the brink of losing our hard fought right to choose. We're going to have to fight like never before to protect our rights and those of the next generation," said Sonia Ossorio, President of NOW-NY. In New York, abortion protections provided by Roe v. Wade were codified into state law last year, while insurance companies were also mandated to cover contraception. But various aspects of reproductive health continue to be debated and discussed. Among those testifying at Wednesday’s hearing, which is expected to largely focus on the bill package but to also look at sexual and reproductive rights more broadly, will be representatives of the New York City Department of Health and of the city’s Commission on Gender Equity, according to City Council Member Helen Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council Committee on Women and Gender Equity. In an interview, Rosenthal said that the package of bills is a result of meetings with experts to figure out how to best support women’s reproductive health. "The Women's Caucus, and the BLAC -- the Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus -- has been meeting jointly on a number of these issues, to hear from advocates, activists, and medical professionals themselves, who are experts in these areas. And that's why you have this broad range for very thoughtful legislation," she said. Rosenthal is the lead sponsor on a bill that would create an advisory board on gender equity in city hospitals. The bill was written after a group of female medical students sued Mt. Sinai hospital for gender discrimination last year. Rosenthal said that gender-based discrimination in hospitals not only harms the employees, but also affects the patients as well. “If a doctor berates a female medical student who is responsible for a particular patient and then leaves the room, how is that patient supposed to respect that medical student?” she said. The board would consist of 13 members, including city officials as well as members of the medical community and students. Both emergency and long term-reversible contraception would be made available at Department of Health and Mental Hygiene facilities if a bill sponsored by Council Member Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council’s Committee on Hospitals, is passed. The bill would provide free or low-cost access to the insertion or removal of long acting-reversible contraception such as an intrauterine device or subdermal contraceptive implants. As chair of one of the committees at hand, Rosenthal will lead the oversight portion of the hearing along with Council Member Mark Levine, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council’s health committee, while other members of the two committees and of the larger Council who decide to participate will also be able to ask questions of those testifying. Also in the package of legislation are two bills on female gential mutilation and cutting, which aim to create an advisory board and educate health-care professionals on how to identify the practices. Female genital mutilation is outlawed in New York State but has gone underground and continues to affect an estimated 60,000-plus women in the New York and New Jersey metro area, according to Council Member Rosenthal, who is the lead sponsor on the education bill. “When a medical professional, a doctor, is presented with someone who is trying to get pregnant or who may already be pregnant and has undergone female genital cutting,” Rosenthal said, “that doctor needs to know what they're looking at. And many doctors don't.” According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Office of Women’s Health, female genital mutilation and cutting may complicate a childbirth if not properly identified by a doctor. The bill seeking to establish an advisory board for female genital mutilation and cutting, sponsored by Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel, a Brooklyn Democrat, would help educate providers and establish guidelines on the identification and protection of those at risk of the practices. The board would also change the way the city collects data on the practice and would develop outreach campaigns aimed at preventing such practices from occurring. In a follow-up to his original bill, which required that employers provide breastfeeding employees with on-site lactation rooms, which went into effect last year, Council Member Robert Cornegy, a Brooklyn Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would require lactation rooms to be regularly inspected by the city Health Department and also provide training on how to prepare and clean the rooms. Also on the agenda for the hearing is consideration of a bill introduced by Council Member Danny Dromm, a Queens Democrat, that is aimed at preventing medically unnecessary procedures on intersex infants will also be considered on Thursday. If passed, it would create a public outreach campaign to educate New Yorkers about “medically unnecessary treatments and interventions performed on infants born with intersex traits.” The bill would also postpone any procedure until the intersex person can make an informed decision about the procedure, rather than having that decision made at birth by their parents. Along with the bills under consideration, the Council will be considering two non-binding resolutions on abortion, one specifically calling on the federal government to rescind the changes on Title X funding issued last year, which prohibits health care providers who recieve federal funding from performing abortions or providing abortion referrals to patients as a part of family planning. According to the resolution, introduced by Council Member Diana Ayala, a Democrat representing parts of Manhattan and the Bronx, the federal changes disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities whose members rely on Title X clinics for reproductive and preventative health care services. The second resolution, proposed by Council Member Margaret Chin, a Manhattan Democrat, calls on federal and state legislators to oppose a ban on sex-selective abortions, arguing that they perpetuate a racial stereotype against Asian-American and Pacific-Islander women. A ban on sex-selective abortions, according to the resolution, could potentially lead to further restrictions on access to abortion and “scrutinizes a woman’s reasons for making the decision to terminate a pregnancy.” *** by Caroline Leddy, Gotham Gazette @caroline_leddy @GothamGazette Read more by this writer. Tags: City Council • Helen Rosenthal • Mark Levine • Abortion • Health care • Carlina Rivera • reproductive rights City Council Holds Hearing on Sexual and Reproductive Right October 27,  2020 by Caroline Leddy  City Council Member Helen Rosenthal, right (photo: John McCarten/City Council) New York City Council Members will hold an oversight hearing Wednesday on “sexual and reproductive rights in New York City” and consider a package of legislation on those subjects, at a joint hearing of the Council’s Committee on Health and Committee on Women and Gender Equity. The bills cover a wide range of issues, including access to contraception, establishing a board on gender equity in hospitals, and providing health care professionals with training on how to identify the signs of female genital mutilation. Most of the bills fall under the World Health Organization's 17 indicators of reproductive health, according to a City Council spokesperson. The hearing comes at a time where reproductive rights in the United States are again at the center of the national political conversation, amid a presidential election, the recent death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a strong supporter of abortion rights, and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has expressed opposition to abortion, to replace Ginsburg on the high court, tilting it further toward conservatives and raising concerns among pro-choice Americans that the Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling could be overturned. The National Organization for Women’s New York City chapter issued a statement soon after Justice Barrett was confirmed, signaling that women’s reproductive rights may now be at stake with her on the bench. “We're on the brink of losing our hard fought right to choose. We're going to have to fight like never before to protect our rights and those of the next generation," said Sonia Ossorio, President of NOW-NY. In New York, abortion protections provided by Roe v. Wade were codified into state law last year, while insurance companies were also mandated to cover contraception. But various aspects of reproductive health continue to be debated and discussed. Among those testifying at Wednesday’s hearing, which is expected to largely focus on the bill package but to also look at sexual and reproductive rights more broadly, will be representatives of the New York City Department of Health and of the city’s Commission on Gender Equity, according to City Council Member Helen Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council Committee on Women and Gender Equity. In an interview, Rosenthal said that the package of bills is a result of meetings with experts to figure out how to best support women’s reproductive health. "The Women's Caucus, and the BLAC -- the Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus -- has been meeting jointly on a number of these issues, to hear from advocates, activists, and medical professionals themselves, who are experts in these areas. And that's why you have this broad range for very thoughtful legislation," she said. Rosenthal is the lead sponsor on a bill that would create an advisory board on gender equity in city hospitals. The bill was written after a group of female medical students sued Mt. Sinai hospital for gender discrimination last year. Rosenthal said that gender-based discrimination in hospitals not only harms the employees, but also affects the patients as well. “If a doctor berates a female medical student who is responsible for a particular patient and then leaves the room, how is that patient supposed to respect that medical student?” she said. The board would consist of 13 members, including city officials as well as members of the medical community and students. Both emergency and long term-reversible contraception would be made available at Department of Health and Mental Hygiene facilities if a bill sponsored by Council Member Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council’s Committee on Hospitals, is passed. The bill would provide free or low-cost access to the insertion or removal of long acting-reversible contraception such as an intrauterine device or subdermal contraceptive implants. As chair of one of the committees at hand, Rosenthal will lead the oversight portion of the hearing along with Council Member Mark Levine, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Council’s health committee, while other members of the two committees and of the larger Council who decide to participate will also be able to ask questions of those testifying. Also in the package of legislation are two bills on female gential mutilation and cutting, which aim to create an advisory board and educate health-care professionals on how to identify the practices. Female genital mutilation is outlawed in New York State but has gone underground and continues to affect an estimated 60,000-plus women in the New York and New Jersey metro area, according to Council Member Rosenthal, who is the lead sponsor on the education bill. “When a medical professional, a doctor, is presented with someone who is trying to get pregnant or who may already be pregnant and has undergone female genital cutting,” Rosenthal said, “that doctor needs to know what they're looking at. And many doctors don't.” According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Office of Women’s Health, female genital mutilation and cutting may complicate a childbirth if not properly identified by a doctor. The bill seeking to establish an advisory board for female genital mutilation and cutting, sponsored by Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel, a Brooklyn Democrat, would help educate providers and establish guidelines on the identification and protection of those at risk of the practices. The board would also change the way the city collects data on the practice and would develop outreach campaigns aimed at preventing such practices from occurring. In a follow-up to his original bill, which required that employers provide breastfeeding employees with on-site lactation rooms, which went into effect last year, Council Member Robert Cornegy, a Brooklyn Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would require lactation rooms to be regularly inspected by the city Health Department and also provide training on how to prepare and clean the rooms. Also on the agenda for the hearing is consideration of a bill introduced by Council Member Danny Dromm, a Queens Democrat, that is aimed at preventing medically unnecessary procedures on intersex infants will also be considered on Thursday. If passed, it would create a public outreach campaign to educate New Yorkers about “medically unnecessary treatments and interventions performed on infants born with intersex traits.” The bill would also postpone any procedure until the intersex person can make an informed decision about the procedure, rather than having that decision made at birth by their parents. Along with the bills under consideration, the Council will be considering two non-binding resolutions on abortion, one specifically calling on the federal government to rescind the changes on Title X funding issued last year, which prohibits health care providers who recieve federal funding from performing abortions or providing abortion referrals to patients as a part of family planning. According to the resolution, introduced by Council Member Diana Ayala, a Democrat representing parts of Manhattan and the Bronx, the federal changes disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities whose members rely on Title X clinics for reproductive and preventative health care services. The second resolution, proposed by Council Member Margaret Chin, a Manhattan Democrat, calls on federal and state legislators to oppose a ban on sex-selective abortions, arguing that they perpetuate a racial stereotype against Asian-American and Pacific-Islander women. A ban on sex-selective abortions, according to the resolution, could potentially lead to further restrictions on access to abortion and “scrutinizes a woman’s reasons for making the decision to terminate a pregnancy.”  *** by Caroline Leddy, Gotham Gazette @caroline_leddy @GothamGazette Read more by this writer.

Photo via NYC Unity By David Brand As attorneys argued a workplace rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court last October, advocates and members of the de Blasio Administration gathered at City Hall to unveil a first-of-its-kind employment program for homeless LGBTQ young people in New York City. But seven months later, the initiative, known as NYC Unity Works, is on the chopping block — a budget casualty that will save the city $2.7 million over the next four years Unity Works was set to begin July 1 as the next phase of the lauded NYC Unity Project, which supports LGBTQ young people far more likely to experience homelesness , face violence or commit suicide than their peers. Unity Works would connect participants to jobs with meaningful opportunities for growth — not just dead-end, minimum wage roles. “We’re proud to launch the nation’s most comprehensive workforce program for LGBTQI young people to make sure they have the education, training and the experience they need to start successful careers,” said First Lady Chirlane McCray at the time . “We will not sit on our hands while the forces in Washington, DC, and throughout this country push back on human rights and push back on our truth.” Now, however, the program is on indefinite “pause” as the city looks to cut spending and adjust to the coronavirus, the mayor’s office said. “Unfortunately, we will only be able to revisit the NYC Unity works contract when this deadly pandemic winds down,” said City Hall spokesperson Laura Feyer. The de Blasio administration is still committed to supporting LGBTQ young people, Feyer added. The Department of Community and Youth Development, which administers the Unity Works program, had already selected a contract recipient, but the agency never announced which organization would get the money to run the program, advocates said. First Lady Chirlane McCray unveiled The Unity Project in 2017. She and the de Blasio administration introduced NYC Unity Works in October 2019, garnering praise from advocates nationwide. Photo by Edwin J. Torres/Mayoral Photography In a letter Tuesday, dozens of local groups urged Mayor Bill de Blasio, DYCD Commissioner Bill Chong and Unity Project Director Ashe McGovern to award the contract and not cut a program that would facilitate jobs for some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers. “At a time when marginalized communities are already being disproportionately impacted financially by the COVID-19 crisis, we find it completely unacceptable that the City is not ensuring that a program that was intentionally developed to address income inequality faced by LGBTQ youth is not being awarded as planned,” reads the letter drafted by Coalition for Homeless Youth Executive Director Jamie Powlovich. The letter refers to Runaway and Homeless Youth, or RHY — a term the city and nonprofits use to refer to homeless people aged 16 to 24. “RHY youth, particularly LGBTQI youth, are disproportionately experiencing the impact of COVID-19 already and by suspending or delaying the start of this vital program, the City will be making the decision to negatively impact this population further,” the letter continues. The suspension came as a surprise to advocates because the city has celebrated the NYC Unity Project, even featuring the initiative in an ad campaign on subways and buses . As a part of the NYC Unity Project, “We Are LGBTQ Youth” campaign hits subways, buses, and social media: https://t.co/kbCApQAaPp @NYCFirstLady pic.twitter.com/hEsSNPAjMh — City of New York (@nycgov) May 14, 2018 Powlovich told the Eagle she understands the city’s budget woes — a $6 billion deficit exacerbated by the coronavirus — but said that Unity Works is a relatively modest expense with valuable outcomes. Coupled with the potential loss of the Summer Youth Employment Program , homeless LGBTQ New Yorkers between ages 16 and 24 will have few opportunities for job training and placement, she said. “The city is taking away all intentional investments in the economic stability of homeless young adults,” Powlovich said. Alex Roque, the executive director of social service organization Ali Forney Center, said the program could mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis for many homeless LGBTQ youth. “The coronavirus will further wedge the disparities that young people experience, including the lack of access to employment,” said Roque, whose organization signed the letter to the city. “I trust the city takes into account that this is a population that is on the outskirts of the outskirts and the most marginalized of all.” May 15, 2020 / David Brand / Communities , Features , Homelessness , Housing , news , politics homeless crisis , homeless lgbtq youth , nyc unity works , unity project , dycd , chirlane mccray David Brand May 15, 2020 May 15, 2020 NYC halts celebrated work program for homeless LGBTQ youth May 15, 2020 / May 15, 2020 / / David Brand  David Brand The city will cut an employment initiative for homeless LGBTQ young people set to begin July 1.

The Department of Community and Youth Development, which administers the Unity Works program, had already selected a contract recipient, but the agency never announced which organization would get the money to run the program, advocates said.

The letter refers to Runaway and Homeless Youth, or RHY — a term the city and nonprofits use to refer to homeless people aged 16 to 24. “RHY youth, particularly LGBTQI youth, are disproportionately experiencing the impact of COVID-19 already and by suspending or delaying the start of this vital program, the City will be making the decision to negatively impact this population further,” the letter continues. The suspension came as a surprise to advocates because the city has celebrated the NYC Unity Project, even featuring the initiative in an ad campaign on subways and buses . in an ad campaign on subways and buses As a part of the NYC Unity Project, “We Are LGBTQ Youth” campaign hits subways, buses, and social media: https://t.co/kbCApQAaPp @NYCFirstLady pic.twitter.com/hEsSNPAjMh Powlovich told the Eagle she understands the city’s budget woes — a $6 billion deficit exacerbated by the coronavirus — but said that Unity Works is a relatively modest expense with valuable outcomes.

New York | Seeking a Cure for Troubled Hospitals in Brooklyn  https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/nyregion/strained-brooklyn-hospitals-are-subject-of-cuomo-study-group.html Share full article Share full article   41 41 41 41 41 Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Seeking a Cure for Troubled Hospitals in Brooklyn Share full article 41 41 By Nina Bernstein Nov. 9, 2011 When the pain in his groin was too great to bear, Ralph Hutchins, who works as a mover, headed to the crowded emergency room at the nearest hospital one recent Tuesday, his life at risk. Tanya Boynton, a mother of four who works 12-hour shifts, hobbled into another emergency room from a homeless shelter, afraid illness would end her job. They needed care in the heart of Brooklyn, not far from the world’s richest concentration of premier hospitals. Only a few private hospitals have survived in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville and Bushwick to serve poor patients like them. Now all are in such dire financial shape that a small group of veteran health care planners appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is debating last-ditch measures to save them. For decades, the fallback solution in American cities has been to close such hospitals. But one of the actions being considered by the group may be even more radical: expunge the hospitals’ debt of more than $1 billion, partly at taxpayer expense, and then let large for-profit companies take over the facilities and restructure patients’ care. Experts say what ultimately becomes of the hospitals could make them a model, or a disastrous experiment, in the delivery of health care to the poor. The proposals are still being drafted but are already generating concern among public health advocates, who worry that the changes would shred a frayed medical safety net and send the poorest and uninsured patients to other overwhelmed hospitals, especially to three public hospitals that are at capacity and facing new budget cuts. Proponents say this fear is unfounded. But it runs deep in New York State, which added a right to health care to its constitution during the Great Depression, and is the only state that still prevents large companies and their stockholders from owning hospitals. “If we don’t figure out a way to redesign the system, we’re going to have free-fall bankruptcies not only in Brooklyn, but all over the state,” said Stephen Berger, chairman of Mr. Cuomo’s Brooklyn Work Group . Its recommendations are due this month. Brooklyn shows the acute stage of a problem that has vexed the nation for years: how to sustain delivery of major medical care to the poor. After the crack and H.I.V. epidemics of the 1980s, either shrinking hospitals with empty beds or letting them fail was seen as a way to make the system more efficient. But as big cities lost more than half their hospitals, closings were concentrated in places like central Brooklyn, where the bed-to-population ratio is now below state and national averages and busy hospitals are struggling financially despite high occupancy rates. Kings County Hospital Center, Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center and the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, the three public hospitals in the area, could shoot up to as much as 130 percent of capacity and face a third more emergency room visits if even one or two of the most vulnerable private hospitals closed, according to a study submitted to the Berger group by the union representing interns and residents at public and private hospitals. Alan Aviles, the president of New York City’s public hospital system , said it was making contingency plans for such a flood but could not go it alone, particularly since the collapse of the city’s Roman Catholic hospital network. Image Among endangered hospitals in Brooklyn is Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, where Ralph Hutchins's recent stay was prolonged when it took a week to procure a portable wound pump. Credit... Victor Blue for The New York Times “We have to make sure that we still have voluntary safety net hospitals that are capable of sharing in that effort,” he said, noting that city hospitals already provided 75 percent of all outpatient care to the uninsured. To stay healthy, experts say, even nonprofit private hospitals need a 3 percent profit margin. Only two of Brooklyn’s 10 private hospitals are doing that well, and of the five considered endangered — Interfaith Medical Center, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and Brooklyn Hospital Center — some are hemorrhaging money. Questions about mismanagement hang over some of these institutions, but analysts agree on the basic problem: Most of their patients rely on Medicaid, the government insurance program for the needy, which has been repeatedly cut as eligibility expanded. There is no confidence that the national health care overhaul will help. Indeed, federal cuts expected through 2013 will disproportionately hurt the same hospitals. In neighborhoods with mainly black and Latino residents, in a borough of 2.5 million where more than one in five residents live below the poverty line and two in five receive Medicaid, the five endangered hospitals account for 83,000 admissions, 325,000 emergency room visits and 760,000 clinic visits a year. The case of Mr. Hutchins, who showed up at Wyckoff, illustrates the strain. It was the third time in two months he sought help, he said. This time, at his insistence, the hospital admitted him. Surgery revealed a strangulated hernia so far gone that cutting out life-threatening infected tissue left an open wound, he said. Cost efficiency demanded speedy discharge; last year, Medicaid cut by 31 percent what it would pay for a case like his. But before Mr. Hutchins could be released, the hospital had to get him a portable wound pump. At hospitals that pay suppliers promptly, administrators say, the device typically gets same-day delivery. At Wyckoff, it took a week. Wyckoff’s general counsel, David Hoffman, said the hospital was like a homeowner with an underwater mortgage. Its buildings are worth a fraction of the $88 million it owes on a $140 million state loan, used in 1994 to rebuild. Its reserves are gone. Such hospitals have not benefited from recent gentrification in Brooklyn. Affluent newcomers typically keep ties with their Manhattan doctors, who send them to hospitals there with the prestige to get top dollar from private insurance plans. In 1980, Brooklyn had 26 hospitals; now it has 15, and 41 percent fewer acute-care beds — 2.3 beds per 1,000 residents, compared with Manhattan’s 4.7, the state’s 3.1 and the nation’s 2.6. Image Interfaith Medical Center is one of five Brooklyn hospitals that are regarded as endangered. Credit... Victor Blue for The New York Times That pattern has played out nationwide, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University who has analyzed decades of hospital closings in 52 cities. Professor Sager found that what best predicted that a hospital would be closed was not inefficiency, but location in a minority neighborhood, and for-profit hospitals were likeliest to close. Proposals to save the Brooklyn survivors include a federal waiver that could redirect state Medicaid savings to so-called safety net hospitals, and a push for additional mergers. Another idea is making one or more of the hospitals a free-standing emergency department, a concept being tried at the defunct St. Vincent’s Hospital in Greenwich Village. The proposal requiring the most salesmanship, and possibly a change in law, would leave taxpayers, bondholders and other creditors to absorb the hospitals’ net debt and then invite investors into a reformulated health care network. Steven Moore, an executive with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consultants invited by Mr. Berger to sketch out this proposal, likened Brooklyn’s indebted hospitals to banks with toxic assets, and suggested a bailout first. “Our premise is you have to design a system that will attract private capital,” Mr. Moore said. “Private capital is more efficient, it demands productivity, it demands creativity, it demands innovation.” It also demands profits. Many experts doubted the proposal’s contention that 20 percent to 30 percent waste could be safely carved from Medicaid spending in Brooklyn to yield a reliable return of about 7 percent. At the Greater New York Hospital Association, the lobbying group for hospitals, board members worried about people without insurance, particularly the city’s many illegal immigrants. Getting rid of toxic assets — hospitals’ debt — would not solve the problem of patient mix and revenue, said Kathleen Shure, an association executive, and “the board fears that it will end up in for-profit entities getting rid of ‘toxic populations.’ ” Mr. Berger, an investment banker and veteran of health commissions , is impatient with such objections. “Health care is not hospitals,” he said. “Health care is an integrated system, a network,” one that requires new patterns of investment. By law, hospitals must provide emergency care. But it is unclear what that might mean in a reformulated for-profit system, particularly for people in pain who damage the bottom line, like Ms. Boynton, 40, who limped into Interfaith with what turned out to be an acute attack of gout the same day Mr. Hutchins went to Wyckoff. She would have preferred the Bronx clinic in her Medicaid managed-care plan, but her family had been evicted from its Bronx apartment after the landlord failed to make repairs required for a housing subsidy. At Interfaith, she got a three-day prescription that put her back on her feet and commuting, from a Brooklyn homeless shelter to her $300-a-week job at a home goods store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Hutchins, 50, now discharged, is also on the mend. The hospital’s prognosis is more guarded. “We stay open at the grace and generosity of our vendors,” said Mr. Hoffman, Wyckoff’s general counsel. “They know it will eventually get better, because we have to have hospitals. Otherwise, we’ll have sick and dying people lying in the streets, and nobody wants that.” A version of this article appears in print on , Section A , Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Caring for Poor In Harsh Focus As Hospitals Ail .

That’s something we can all be proud of. But the ACA’s inherent promise of greater health equity still leaves many people struggling with health-care costs — especially in New York City, which has a high cost of living and a more diverse population. For example, almost 60% of New York City residents had a health care cost problem last year — that’s a rate almost 15 percentage points higher than experienced by comparable consumers elsewhere in our state, according to a survey issued last month by Altarum and released by the Community Service Society. New Yorkers are forced to make bad choices because of their affordability burdens, such as skipping tests or treatments, delaying going to the doctor, cutting pills in half or skipping doses altogether, and avoiding going to the doctor entirely. An important factor for New York City residents is our diversity; race, ethnicity, LGBTQ identity, language and immigration status exacerbate the barriers that we face in our complex health system. Just imagine the challenges of making the most of your health-care coverage if you don’t understand your coverage rules, or have never appealed a medical bill, or are afraid of filing a complaint because of your immigration status? The barriers to accessing mental health and substance use care are even bigger because of the stigma often associated with receiving treatment. These struggles are often lost on the average New Yorker. After all, New York is known for pioneering progressive health-care policies that have helped transform our health care system and led to advancements in health care coverage for some of our most vulnerable populations. For example, New York created “Health and Recovery Plans” to provide additional supports to help people with serious mental health conditions and substance use disorders achieve recovery. Even so, the gaps in our health care system are real, especially for low-income New Yorkers, communities of color, consumers with special needs and those in culturally and linguistically isolated communities. Here’s the good news: New York City has nationally recognized experience delivering health care services and programs to vulnerable and diverse communities. Between 1998 and 2010, New York City funded its own City-wide consumer assistance program called the Managed Care Consumer Assistance Program — a model adopted for the nation under the ACA, but then opposed by the Republicans during their anti-ACA wars. The program assisted the city’s most vulnerable populations, who struggle to navigate complex coverage rules, complaints and appeals processes, and medical bills by themselves. MCCAP served around 140,000 residents with all types of insurance coverage, in all five boroughs, offering services in 10 different languages, through a grassroots collaboration of 26 community-based organizations administered by the Community Service Society of New York. Better yet, MCCAP was a financial “twofer. Every dollar allocated by the City Council was matched by the federal government — so the City Council’s $2 million for MCCAP instantly became a $4 million program to expand and enhance health care services to New York City residents. In 2010, MCCAP was dismantled when City Council funding was abruptly eliminated when hard budget choices were made during the Great Recession. While New York State leaders in Albany were able to secure some ACA federal and state funding for a statewide look-alike program called Community Health Advocates — bringing valuable services to people upstate — New York City consumers have significantly less funding than before. The elimination of City Council funding meant New York City lost important resources for its underserved communities. Today, fewer than half of the former MCCAP CBOs continue to provide services under the CHA program. Restoring MCCAP would help the city in its fight against racial and ethnic health disparities. The program’s community-based organizations were rooted in critical communities as demonstrated by its statistics: 61% of MCCAP clients were racial and ethnic minorities, and 70% of MCCAP services were provided in languages other than English. As the city continues deliberations on a $92 billion municipal budget, we urge the City Council to consider restoring funding for MCCAP in next year’s budget. By bringing the program back, the Council will be helping our most vulnerable populations, including people with mental health conditions and substance use disorders, access quality health care programs and services from trusted and experienced organizations with deep ties to the communities they serve. At a time when immigrants, people of color and health care are under attack by the Trump administration, let’s do all we can to reduce costs and improve access to health care for underserved New Yorkers.

The barriers to accessing mental health and substance use care are even bigger because of the stigma often associated with receiving treatment. These struggles are often lost on the average New Yorker. After all, New York is known for pioneering progressive health-care policies that have helped transform our health care system and led to advancements in health care coverage for some of our most vulnerable populations. For example, New York created “Health and Recovery Plans” to provide additional supports to help people with serious mental health conditions and substance use disorders achieve recovery. Even so, the gaps in our health care system are real, especially for low-income New Yorkers, communities of color, consumers with special needs and those in culturally and linguistically isolated communities. Here’s the good news: New York City has nationally recognized experience delivering health care services and programs to vulnerable and diverse communities. Between 1998 and 2010, New York City funded its own City-wide consumer assistance program called the Managed Care Consumer Assistance Program — a model adopted for the nation under the ACA, but then opposed by the Republicans during their anti-ACA wars. The program assisted the city’s most vulnerable populations, who struggle to navigate complex coverage rules, complaints and appeals processes, and medical bills by themselves. MCCAP served around 140,000 residents with all types of insurance coverage, in all five boroughs, offering services in 10 different languages, through a grassroots collaboration of 26 community-based organizations administered by the Community Service Society of New York. Better yet, MCCAP was a financial “twofer. Every dollar allocated by the City Council was matched by the federal government — so the City Council’s $2 million for MCCAP instantly became a $4 million program to expand and enhance health care services to New York City residents. In 2010, MCCAP was dismantled when City Council funding was abruptly eliminated when hard budget choices were made during the Great Recession. While New York State leaders in Albany were able to secure some ACA federal and state funding for a statewide look-alike program called Community Health Advocates — bringing valuable services to people upstate — New York City consumers have significantly less funding than before. The elimination of City Council funding meant New York City lost important resources for its underserved communities. Today, fewer than half of the former MCCAP CBOs continue to provide services under the CHA program. Restoring MCCAP would help the city in its fight against racial and ethnic health disparities. The program’s community-based organizations were rooted in critical communities as demonstrated by its statistics: 61% of MCCAP clients were racial and ethnic minorities, and 70% of MCCAP services were provided in languages other than English. As the city continues deliberations on a $92 billion municipal budget, we urge the City Council to consider restoring funding for MCCAP in next year’s budget. By bringing the program back, the Council will be helping our most vulnerable populations, including people with mental health conditions and substance use disorders, access quality health care programs and services from trusted and experienced organizations with deep ties to the communities they serve. At a time when immigrants, people of color and health care are under attack by the Trump administration, let’s do all we can to reduce costs and improve access to health care for underserved New Yorkers.

List of organizations that endorsed the platform below. Follow Climate Works for All on Twitter and Facebook for campaign updates and how you can help us make this recovery plan a reality. We are the Climate Works for All coalition, a coalition of labor, community, environmental justice and faith organizations all working together to fight climate change and ensure a just transition and fair economy for workers and low-income communities. We are in the midst of a global health and economic crisis. The economy is collapsing, and we have already seen widespread job loss and trauma for many people that will continue to grow. We are now seeing what our coalition has known all along, that the hardest hit areas where most essential and low-wage workers reside are black and brown neighborhoods. For example, a recent preliminary study found that long-term exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter puts communities at a significantly higher risk of dying from coronavirus ; communities with higher levels of pollution across the city are low-income, black and brown communities. The black population may be dying at a younger age than the white population. And, though only about 29% of the population, Latinx deaths account for 34% of the deaths in NYC , the largest share for any racial or ethnic group. Over 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last 4 weeks , rising to a higher rate than at any point since the Great Depression. New York City has the 4th highest job loss in the nation. Unemployment disparities mirror the lack of access to healthcare across racial lines. Restaurant, nail salon, retail and other sectors where workers, who are overwhelmingly women of color, are experiencing the highest job loss, and their jobs may not return at all after the crisis. But this is not a new story. Our communities have faced economic disenfranchisement and disinvestment for decades, lacking access to affordable and healthy housing, quality healthcare, residing in the most polluted areas of the city, and working for poverty wages. The coronavirus pandemic has taught us that our government is grossly unprepared to protect our most vulnerable communities. But we can learn from this crisis and take aggressive, bold action to prepare for the crisis that has existed before the global pandemic: climate change. There is no time to sit and wait. Climate solutions will create direct opportunities for coming out of an economic collapse, but only if there is large-scale, coordinated citywide action rooted in equity. If we get this right today, we can create a forward-looking plan that addresses how our communities, especially frontline communities, can recover from an unprecedented economic crisis and thrive in a post-COVID city by building a resilient New York. In a time of great uncertainty, this much is clear: WE NEED GOOD JOBS. We need to move on a plan to create good jobs as soon as the economy can reopen safely, and that proactive plan can be adopted now. Our movement is coming together — labor unions, community organizations, environmental justice groups, and elected officials — to collectively call for immediate funds from the federal government to help us rebuild as a city. Austerity does not bring prosperity or justice or solutions to climate change. Another world is possible when we come out the other side. We stand together to call on our government for a commitment to the Climate and Community stimulus plan to strengthen our economy, put workers back to work in good, sustainable union jobs, prioritize the health, safety and wellbeing of environmental justice and low income communities, and move us towards our climate goals. Below is our platform that outlines major job creation strategies in the climate economy, and we emphasize that the following key principles be followed in the transition: 1. Centering low income Black and brown environmental justice communities 2. Creating good union jobs within the climate industry 3.

Sign In My Account  Sign In My Account Guest User November 27, 2017 Policy , Housing LiveOn NY Study: New York’s Affordable Housing Crisis for Seniors Persists Guest User November 27, 2017 Policy , Housing Wait Time Upwards of 10.3 years; Minimum of 19,700 Seniors Languish on Affordable Housing Waitlists on the Upper West Side Study Conducted in Manhattan Community Districts 7 and 9 — UWS Likely Indicative of City at Large Read the Full Report Here For Immediate Release CONTACT: Andrea Cianfrani, Dir. of Public Policy, 212-398-6565x233, acianfrani@liveon-ny.org New York, NY — The number of seniors on wait lists for affordable housing in New York continues to rise as the city gets older, according to a white paper released today by LiveOn NY, an advocacy and policy organization for New York’s community-based aging service providers. Highlights from the study: 19,700 seniors are currently on waiting lists in Community Districts 7 and 9 on the Upper West Side. With an overall response rate of 44%, it is estimated that an astounding 44,028 seniors are on waiting lists for affordable housing through the HUD202 program in this neighborhood alone. Of the seven affordable housing developments which responded to the study, only three were currently accepting additions to their waitlists With an average wait time of 10.6 years, a senior who signs up for affordable housing at the moment of eligibility—62 years old—will wait on average until he or she is 72.6 for affordable housing. “This study is proof of something we’ve known for a long time—New York City must continue to expand the stock of affordable senior housing with services, which allow seniors to age in the communities they have helped to build,” said Allison Nickerson, Executive Director of LiveOn NY . “As New York gets older, it is crucial that we direct resources to developing new affordable housing and ensuring that seniors can age with dignity and respect. Our communities must rally around organizations and elected officials who fight to make New York a better, safer city to age in place.” Approximately 45 affordable units become vacant in the neighborhood each year.  With over 19,700 seniors waiting to receive them, the odds of receiving affordable housing have become increasingly bleak. However, the white paper notes that the disparity in affordable housing access would almost certainly be even wider without the work of local and city officials to close the gap—including mayor Bill de Blasio’s efforts to construct or preserve 15,000 units of affordable senior housing as a component of the city’s overall housing plan, and Council Members Mark Levine and Vanessa Gibson’s initiative to ensure that low income tenants have access to a civil lawyer when facing eviction. Though the study takes place in Community Districts 7 and 9, the organization believes that the findings are indicative of the city at large, where over 200,000 seniors are on waitlists for affordable housing, according to an earlier study. “Too many of the most vulnerable New Yorkers – especially seniors – are currently facing a staggering affordability crisis in our city,” said New York City Council Member Mark Levine . “New Yorkers have the right to affordable housing, which is why I’m so proud that just this August -- with the invaluable help of advocates like LiveOn NY -- we were able to pass my legislation creating a right to counsel for tenants facing eviction, which will protect tens of thousands for seniors from being unfairly evicted from their homes. However, this report makes it clear there is still much more to do. I look forward to continuing to work with LiveOn NY, and my colleagues such as Council Member Margaret Chin, to make sure the City is doing everything in its power to help the 200,000 seniors currently waiting for affordable housing.” "This study provides more evidence of a growing crisis that demands tough decisions by elected officials called to represent all of our communities -- not just a privileged few lucky enough to have housing that is safe, accessible and affordable," said Councilwoman Margaret Chin, chair of the City Council's Committee on Aging . "One of the highest callings of the progressive movement is the commitment to caring for the most vulnerable among us. In our drive to be a more fair, equitable and just city, we cannot overlook the growing number of seniors who are still waiting for housing. We have a solemn obligation to these seniors who have contributed, and continue to contribute, so much to the life of one of the greatest cities in the world. It's my hope that this study will be a wake up call for us all that we may never forget this solemn obligation to our elders." "Thank you to LiveOn NY for shedding light on the extent of the housing crisis in New York City and how it disproportionately affects our seniors. It is unacceptable that as many as 44,000 seniors are currently on waiting lists for affordable housing in Community Districts 7 and 9 on the Upper West Side. My office has assisted hundreds of seniors in danger of losing their homes, which many have lived in for most of their lives, because of soaring property values and the rising cost of living overall. We must protect residents who have been the bedrock of our neighborhoods that we call home. I hope this white paper becomes a galvanizing step toward comprehensive citywide solutions that give our seniors the support they need at the moment they need it most,” said Council Member Helen Rosenthal . “The numbers tell the story – we need to build much more affordable senior housing,” said Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer . “Stable, multigenerational neighborhoods are one of the cornerstones of a healthy city – we need our seniors, and they need us. Thank you to LiveOnNY for this report and the call to action it provides.” As the baby boomer generation ages, the city population is skewing older.  New York City’s senior population is expected to grow by 47% by 2030, with a growing percentage of seniors preferring to age in place, surrounded by the social networks and supports they have cultivated over a lifetime rather than making the often costly move to a nursing home.  These factors will combine to ensure that demand for affordable senior housing continues to grow dramatically citywide. The study, conducted on the Upper West Side, is part of a larger series on affordable housing that the organization has released over the past few years. In 2016, LiveOn found that 2,000 seniors were on wait lists for affordable housing in nearby Council Districts 6 and 7—with a response rate of 37%, the organization estimated that upwards of 5,406 could actually have been waiting for a spot. The average wait for affordable housing last year was seven years.

Queens City Councilmember Danny Dromm's measure would ban locking someone in a cell alone as punishment for a violent offense unless it is used as an immediate measure to de-escalate conflict, according to the bill . Incarcerated individuals would only be allowed to be isolated for four hours after the conflict. Inmates could still be placed in restrictive housing—the same type of unit where the late Layleen Cubilette-Polanco was housed for nine days before she died of epileptic seizures after guards failed to properly check in on her. But Dromm's bill requires that inmates have a hearing with legal counsel before being placed in restrictive housing, with a review every 15 days of "whether the incarcerated person continues to present a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility if housed outside restrictive housing," the legislation reads. "Misbehavior on the part of incarcerated folks should not require the use of torture to correct that misbehavior," Dromm told Gothamist/WNYC. Advocates of the #HALTsolitary Campaign want to strengthen the bill further. The language currently allows for 14 hours of out-of-cell time per day for most inmates, except for those in restrictive housing, who would be permitted 10 hours out of their cells a day. Inmates isolated from others are currently permitted seven hours of out-of-cell time. "[F]or this legislation to actually be effective at ending solitary, there should be no carve outs," a member of the campaign and survivor of solitary confinement, Anisah Sabur, said in a statement. "The basic minimum standards in the city jails of 14 hours out-of-cell per day with access to meaningful human engagement and programming should apply to everyone." Cubilette-Polanco's sister, Melania Brown, said families of those who have died in solitary haven't been fully included in discussions on ending the segregation measures. "My sister went into solitary and came out in a body bag," Brown said. "How many people have to die before they end this torture?" Dromm says the bill could still be altered after feedback at a council committee hearing on Friday. The correction officer union vehemently opposes the legislation. "That really has serious implications for the victims of these crimes," said Correction Officers' Benevolent Association [COBA] spokesperson Michael Skelly. "The correction officers union strongly believes that this legislation is as great a threat to the safety of our members, and everyone in the jails, as the violent inmates who are committing these attacks." In June, Mayor Bill de Blasio formed a working group to end punitive segregation after the city announced 17 correction officers would face disciplinary action for Cubilette-Polanco's death. The Board of Correction was anticipated to hold a hearing on the jail practice in October, but has not yet held one. In November, the chair of the oversight agency said the rule was being drafted and a 30-day comment period would follow soon after. BOC spokesperson Bennett Stein said the agency expects to publish a proposed rule to end solitary this month. Violence between inmates has risen 284% in the last fiscal year , which the city has attributed to a change in record-keeping and a jail population with a higher proportion of people accused of violent crimes. A recent federal monitor report of the city jail system found use of force incidents are also rising due to "hyper-confrontational" staff behaviors and over-reliance on jail riot squads. Dromm says, "I think that the use of violence to supposedly end violence is an incorrect theory to begin with. It just doesn't make sense." The Department of Correction referred our inquiries to City Hall. Mayoral spokesperson Avery Cohen said in a statement the administration is still "fully committed to ending punitive segregation." "To fulfill this goal, we’ll continue working with stakeholders in government and those with lived experience to create a system that ensures the safety and wellbeing of staff and people in custody," Cohen said.

Kathryn Garcia, former NYC Sanitation Chief, helped to open a composting site at Queensboro Bridge; however, locations such as these are now endanger of closing. New Yorkers will be testifying in a hearing on Friday, Dec. 18 to save park composting sites from the trash heap. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the NYC Parks Department have outlined plans to remove public composting sites in favor of using the space for other prospects, such as paved over and transformed into parking lots. This proposal has outraged elected officials and community members alike. In response to this administrative action, Save Our Compost NYC—a coalition of groups working to uplift environmental and climate justice—is pushing the New York City Council to halt these measures while also attempting to rally New York City residents to the cause. Members of the public are planning to both argue their points on a live Zoom (and via phone) during an oversight hearing on Friday at 11 a.m., as well as drafting affidavits that will be taken into consideration up 72 hours after the virtual meeting. It is hoped that if their collective voices are heard, they can prevent these locations from being dislodged. Advocates for the composting sites say it is one of the few ways for people to contribute to the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only that, but they also highlighted that the removal of these eco-friendly locations is counterintuitive to Mayor de Blasio’s pledge that New York City will be free of waste landfills by 2030.

Email Sign Up Over 200 people tuned in to listen to Save Our Compost’s Zoom session, a plea to NYC Parks to allocate composting sites within parkland. In an effort to raise awareness about the importance of the fertilization projects and the upcoming hearing, politicians from all over the boroughs joined a web press conference last Tuesday to defend what they call the “Future of New York City.” Councilmember Antonio Reynoso helmed the virtual event called Save Our Compost, urging NYC Parks to support compost sites on parkland. He shared that after several budget cuts, about $2.8 million was restored to the community compost program, but now the City Parks no longer will be allocating the space to hold compost. By doing so, environmental programs are hindered and unable to provide services, such as the Lower East Side Ecology Center, a community-based organization focusing on sustainability, and Big Reuse, a nonprofit reuse center and hosting site for the compost project. “Community composting sites are the only way for New York City residents to compost through the COVID pandemic and the associated economic downturn. They provide crucial education and outreach, helping residents stay in the habit of composting during curbside collection and any alternative ways to divert from landfills helps our city’s environmental and economic goals. Now, Parks are trying to take away their sites,” said Reynoso. Kathryn Garcia, former NYC Sanitation Chief, joins environmentalists in pushing for NYC Parks to continue to host composting sites. Kathryn Garcia, former NYC Sanitation Chief, and now a candidate for mayor, has been a longtime supporter of zero waste. As she joined the virtual discussion on Tuesday, she shared her surprise and dismay that community compost sites are endangered of shutting down after she just worked on opening a site beneath Queensboro bridge three months ago. “We were just getting back up and running, and folks have been crying out for places to drop off food scraps so that they knew they could help make, what we call ‘The black gold in the City of New York.’ I really think that these sites bring us together. Not only does it provide an enormous amount of volunteer opportunities, but they are really educational showpieces of the circular economy. You take my food scraps, and I give you back compost, and that then makes the tomatoes of tomorrow,” Garcia said. Tuesday’s Zoom press conference concluded with over 200 individuals tuning in to show their support, including elected officials: Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, Congressman Costa Constantinides, and Council members Carlina Rivera, Jimmy Van Bramer, and Ben Kallos.

The Department of Education will provide all elementary  schools with access to an SEL curriculum in partnership with National  University System’s Sanford Harmony program. It will also build RJ practices  into all middle and high schools, providing students with the tools they need  to name their emotions, overcome conflicts and repair relationships. “We’ve heard from students, teachers and parents across our  city, and as a result, we’re revolutionizing our school system and giving our  kids the social-emotional tools they need to ensure they develop into healthy  adults,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio . “I’m proud that New York City is  leading the way in our schools, using research-backed methods that encourage  the whole growth of every student.” “To prepare New York City students for the future we must do  more to make sure they are able to learn while they are in the classroom. We  have a responsibility to make sure our young people have the life skills to  navigate their world inside and outside of the classroom and continue  developing into healthy adults,” said First Lady Chirlane McCray . “This  new approach will help us educate the whole child and create a more positive  school climate with greater supports for our educators.” “It's common sense: when we keep students in the classroom  and help them feel safe and supported in their schools, they will succeed,”  said Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza. “We’re doubling  down on an approach that we know works — giving our teachers the  resources to support our students’ social-emotional skills and well-being,  and, as a result, driving down suspensions and improving outcomes. I  thank Mayor de Blasio and First Lady McCray for their leadership, and I'm  excited to get to work on this next step of our children's agenda.” “We  are proud of the joint efforts between the Department of Education and the New  York City Police Department to keep our young people safe in schools,” said Police  Commissioner James P. O’Neill . “This agreement memorializes best practices  that the Police Department and the Department of Education have developed over  the last twenty years. With reductions in both index crime and enforcement  action in New York City schools, the NYPD School Safety Division continues to focus  on supporting students’ success in every school building.” “The  time has come to stop reacting, to stop having to scramble to help students  after the fact,” said Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of  Teachers . “We need a proactive approach, and hopefully today is the start  of getting the right resources to our educators so we can change the school  climate for all students and staff.” “New  York City has set a new standard for empowering youth,” said Patrick J.  Kennedy, former Congressman and Founder of the Kennedy Forum. “Social-Emotional skills are absolutely critical, both to academic success and  overall health and well-being. Rather than relying on discipline to ‘treat the  symptoms’ of poor communication skills, disconnectedness, inability to manage  emotions, and more, these programs prioritize prevention strategies with  long-term impact. It’s exactly what we need, especially as our country  struggles with mental health and addiction crises. My hope is that other cities  will take notice of this exemplary leadership and follow suit.” “For  years, young people have fought to end the school-to-prison pipeline and make  schools more supportive and inclusive,” said Rikya Theresa Kee, Youth Leader  with Urban Youth Collaborative . “Through most of my school experience, I  felt isolated. My schools did not have the resources they needed to support me,  like restorative practices. Today’s announcement to expand restorative justice,  hire more social workers, and propose changing the discipline code gives me  hope that the city is listening to our voices and moving in the right  direction. Now, we must move to fully end racial disparities and the  criminalization of young people in our schools. We still have work to do.” “Through Sanford Harmony, the National University System is  pleased to express our commitment to advancing this collaborative effort in  support of safer schools and student success,” said Dr. Michael R.  Cunningham, Chancellor of the National University System. “Social-emotional  learning helps even the youngest students to develop skills in communication  and collaboration, reducing conflict and fostering positive school climates  that encourage academic achievement. Today’s announcement ensures that all  elementary students in New York City have access to the powerful,  evidence-based program, a vision of philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, to  encourage positive relationships from the classroom to adulthood.” In collaboration with the United Federation of Teachers, 50  middle schools will receive more intensive programming through the Positive  Learning Collaborative model, a restorative approach to changing school  climate. This work will be enhanced, thanks to the New York City Council, with  a new Thrive initiative of 85 borough-based licensed clinical social workers  specifically designed to support teachers and directly help students facing  emotional distress from the point of crisis to a handoff to long-term care, if  necessary. SEL has been proven to improve students’ academic performance  by prioritizing communication, empathy and problem solving. RJ builds on the  SEL continuum by training students to practice their social-emotional learning  skills in everyday life both inside and outside the classroom. The DOE will now  have an SEL continuum in grades Pre-K-12. The DOE also announced its revised Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) between the NYPD and DOE, updates to the NYPD Patrol Guide  that would significantly limit situations where in-school arrests for  out-of-school incidents are allowed, and proposed changes to the DOE discipline  code to keep suspensions below 20 days in most cases except those that involve  serious or violent incidents. The partnership with Sanford Harmony will provide elementary  schools citywide access to an SEL curriculum for the first time. SEL curricula  build on successful existing RJ models in Districts 5, 12, 16 and 18 which  recognize that students don’t simply learn math and English during their  education, but that their time at school shapes how they interact with other  people and themselves. Through intra- and interpersonal relationship lessons  and activities, SEL helps students develop better control of their feelings and  social skills to complement the academic lessons learned in classrooms. Aspects of SEL are already part of the City’s universal Pre-K  programs, where students learn to identify and communicate their emotions and  deal with stress. Now, elementary schools will receive training and materials  relevant for students at every grade level. Lessons and activities include  daily meet-ups for students to engage with each other and a “buddy-up” system  for students to learn how to get along with others. Middle and high schools across the city will reinforce SEL  tenets by implementing Restorative Justice practices. RJ practices de-emphasize  the reliance on solely traditional punitive discipline. Instead, students are  also encouraged to activate SEL skills by focusing on emotion identification,  conflict resolution and problem solving. The use of these skills becomes part  of a school’s daily practice. Students are trained to become leaders in their  own lives and adults are trained in the restorative framework, recognizing that  outside factors often have significant impacts on a student’s day-to-day  response, and those responses must be addressed through multiple approaches. RJ  helps develop the proactive use of SEL to reduce issues of conflict within the  school. Additionally,  50 of the City’s middle schools will take part in Positive Learning  Collaborative (PLC) programming, a restorative approach to school climate  developed in collaboration with the United Federation of Teachers. All 50  schools will receive training in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools  (TCIS) and additional support in an area of need. A smaller cadre of schools  will become partner schools, and in addition to TCIS training will also receive  on-site coaching, support to implement community circles and access to a  behavior specialist who will guide them in the process. The goal is to help  every adult in a PLC school—from teachers to custodians to principals—cultivate  strong relationships with students so school communities can short-circuit many  problems before they start and prevent others from escalating. Several additional noteworthy reforms will be enacted as part  of the new school climate package, including: NYPD-DOE MOU: A new NYPD-DOE Memorandum of       Understanding governs police engagement in schools following a three-year       collaborative process. The MOU clarifies the roles of NYPD and DOE in       addressing school misconduct and stresses their joint commitment to       ensuring that schools are safe havens for our students. NYPD Patrol Guide: The Patrol Guide, given to all       NYPD patrol officers, significantly limits in-school arrests for low-level       offenses and limits allowable circumstances for in-school arrests to       felony crimes, sex offenses, crimes where there is an immediate risk of       escape or where the perpetrator is in hot pursuit, and similar situations.       The guide also reiterates that a principal or similar trusted adult staff       member will serve as the in-school student advocate until a parent or       guardian arrives. Discipline Code: Proposed changes to the DOE       Discipline Code will keep suspensions below 20 days in most cases except       in those that involve serious or violent incidents, including firearm       offenses with a state-mandated suspension length. The change will build on       existing strategies developed by the DOE’s Division of School Climate and       Wellness that have already reduced the average DOE suspension from 21 days       to 13 days. DOE will host community engagement forums in all five boroughs       beginning in July. DOE will also issue for the first time a comprehensive       guide, with training, to ensure that each school has a proper classroom       removal process. 85 Licensed Clinical Social       Workers: Thanks to the New York City Council, a new Thrive initiative comprised of       a unit of 85 licensed clinical social workers will better support students       facing crises across the City and reduce the practice of school staff       calling emergency medical services. The social workers will be able to       provide care in times of immediate emotional distress and help them       receive long-term care if necessary. The Sanford Harmony elementary school program is an  evidence-based, nationally recognized curriculum that builds stronger classroom  communities through relationship-building lessons and activities. The program  will be managed in partnership with National University; to help implement the  program here, a new NYC-based team will work closely with the NYC Department of  Education and Long Island University while drawing on Sanford Harmony’s  national network of trainers and coaches. To date, Sanford Harmony has trained  over 8,000 NYC teachers. Sanford Harmony has committed $5.8 million to this  expansion. Districts that have used Sanford Harmony so far have found  that students display more empathy and develop stronger relationships with  their peers, improving school climate. Explicit SEL enhances student-teacher  communication and improves academic achievement. Additionally, DOE has piloted universal restorative justice  programs in all schools in District 18 (which includes Flatbush and Canarsie)  since School Year 2015-16. The District has seen double-digit decreases in  suspensions during the program. In the first year of the pilot, District 18 saw  a 25 percent decrease in suspensions. Last year, it saw another 11 percent  decrease. The racial disparity in suspensions  has also fallen in the district compared to the citywide ratio. Citywide,  black students are 2.6 times as likely to be suspended compared to their peers,  but in District 18, they are only 1.2 times as likely. Replicating the model  used in District 18 presents an opportunity to respond to similar challenges  with both locally and nationally evidence-based practices. The entire school climate package will roll out over three  years, with schools citywide divided into three cohorts and receiving services  on a rolling basis. “As  our City has shown time and again, government is capable of advancing big ideas  – swiftly and at scale – but the public sector can’t do it all, and we can’t do  it alone, which makes partnerships like the one with Sanford Harmony so  important and powerful,” said Darren Bloch, Senior Advisor to the Mayor and  Director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships . “Thanks to the support of  T. Denny Sanford, National University and Long Island University, all  elementary students will now have access to a profound set of tools to help  them strive and thrive in school and beyond.” “Restorative justice processes are a powerful method to  improve student relationships and ultimately reduce the likelihood of serious  conflicts,” said Director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice  Elizabeth Glazer . “MOCJ will continue to support innovative school models  and look forward to working with our agency partners and education stakeholders  to generate additional solutions to make our schools more just and safe places  for all.” “All of our students need to know they are not alone and  there are people who can help them,” Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A.  Rosa .  “I applaud Chancellor Carranza’s commitment to promoting a  positive school climate and learning, which enhance the whole child, the whole  school and the whole community. Social Emotional Learning is key to our efforts  to foster equity under the state’s ESSA plan, as it goes hand in hand with the  work being done in schools every day to better academic performance, improve  school climate and reduce exclusionary discipline.” “The quality of school climate is one of the most predictive  factors in promoting school achievement,” said State Education Commissioner  Mary Ellen Elia . “Chancellor Carranza’s renewed focus on these critically  important school climate elements mirrors our efforts across the state to  promote positive school climate, which has been shown to result in a lower  incidence of student absenteeism, suspensions and substance abuse. New York  stands with New York City in its focus on ensuring that schools are safe havens  for students and their teachers, where they are free to teach and to  continually grow together.” “New  York City students deserve to be empowered so they can thrive in our schools.  Through this program, Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice  practices are transforming students’ lives and helping them find success, as  we’ve seen with students in my District. I am glad to see NYC is expanding this  program to embolden more school kids throughout the city,” said Congresswoman  Yvette D. Clarke . “As  a former classroom teacher, I understand how critical it is to invest in the  social and emotional aspects of a child’s education. That’s why I commend the  Mayor for expanding New York City’s education system to include these new  classes. Accounting for the mental health of students provides them with the  ability to achieve both inside and outside the classroom. In addition, the  Mayor’s plan to reform the Department of Education disciplinary code is an  important step in the right direction. Schools are for teaching and learning,  not arresting students to further the school to prison pipeline. I am pleased  the city has recognized these realities and offered a proposal to better our  public schools,” said Congressman Eliot Engel. “I  am very excited that New York City will be bringing social-emotional wellness  and restorative justice practices to the fore of our children's education,”  said State Senator Robert Jackson. “Research backs up the benefits of  these approaches, especially among working-class communities of color where  students have for too long been over-disciplined by suspensions and  criminalized in ways that perpetuate cycles of oppression. I look forward to  seeing these programs expand to cover all children in New York City in the  coming years. This is an important step in the direction of a brighter  educational future for our young people.” "For  too long, our schools have over-relied on punishment and under-invested in  social support,” said State Senator Zellnor Y. Myrie . “As a result,  black and brown students are too often funneled into the school-to-prison  pipeline for incidents that could have been addressed with counselors rather  than cops. The expansion of SEL and Restorative Justice in our schools is a  step toward recognizing the dignity and potential of every single student;  expanding their future rather than trapping them in their past. I am encouraged  by this effort and look forward to building on this momentum." “As  the sponsor of state legislation on this important topic, I applaud the Mayor  and Chancellor's efforts to make schools safe and welcoming environments for  all of our students,” said Assembly Member Cathy Nolan . “Schools must be  places where students feel comfortable and can learn properly, and I look  forward to working with our schools, students and families on this important  issue at both the city and state level.” “For  too long, black and brown children have been made to feel like second class  citizens in their own schools and classrooms. Children cannot learn in  environments where they do not feel safe and respected” said Assembly Member  Diana Richardson . “I commend the Mayor and Chancellor for taking this  important step forward. I look forward to working with them to ensure this is  just the start to changing a school discipline system that has not treated our  children fairly.” “Reforming the NYC school discipline process is a subject of  extreme importance to me as Black girls in NYC are nine times as likely to be  suspended in comparison to their white counterparts,” said Assembly Member Latrice  Walker. “This mayoral initiative continues a conversation my colleagues and  I in Albany have had about addressing children and understanding the  social-emotional learning challenges many of our inner-city school children  face. This is a good first step and I look forward to working with the city to  implement further restorative practices and continue the push at the statewide  level.” “Today  the Mayor and City Council showed that they agree with my assessment that the  mental health of New York City students is a priority by passing a budget that  included $30 million for 285 social workers for New York City students,” said Manhattan  Borough President Gale A. Brewer . “It’s a great first step toward my goal  of at least one full-time social worker in every school. School-based social  workers make a huge impact, and I’ll continue to work to ensure direct access  to mental health care for New York’s students.” “Social  and emotional learning is an important way to ensure we are taking a  whole-child approach to education. Children cannot perform well in school if  they’re dealing with trauma and conflict in their lives. That’s why I have been  proud to support mindfulness as a start to the school day for students, joining  with Chancellor Carranza and Council Member Espinal earlier this year to  announce the Yoga and Mindfulness Teacher Preparation Program. I have also been  proud to facilitate groundbreaking participatory budgeting projects at two high  school campuses in Brooklyn this year that work off of the concept of  encouraging restorative justice practices. These steps will make a positive  difference in the lives of our children, and I applaud the Mayor and the First  Lady for their steadfast advocacy,” said Brooklyn Borough President Eric L.  Adams . “Students  need more social and emotional supports, not punitive disciplinary measures –  and I’ve been proud to join with advocates, especially our powerful youth  voices, to make sure the welfare of our students is the city’s top priority.  The new school climate MOU is a positive step forward to implement social and  emotional supports, which includes providing crucial Restorative Justice  training that will offer vital mechanisms for conflict resolution and  increasing the number of licensed clinical social workers available to  students. It’s also very important that this MOU will limit NYPD activity in  schools so that there will not be arrests in schools for low-level offenses. In  addition, the number of days allowed for suspensions will be limited, which  helps ensure our students do not have long disruptions to their education,”  said Council Member Mark Treyger, Chair of the Committee on Education .  “I commend Mayor de Blasio and Chancellor Carranza for their efforts to  implement the MOU and institute more social and emotional supports throughout  our school system, and I’m so proud of our students for advocating for these  important and necessary changes.” “Throughout  the last school year, students across the city have sent the clear message to  City Hall and the City Council that more counseling and services are what they  need to feel safer in schools, not more law enforcement,” said Council  Member Donovan Richards, Chair of the Committee on Public Safety .  “Thankfully, today’s announcement shows that those voices did not fall on deaf  ears as the Department of Education is now dedicating their efforts on  social-emotional learning and restorative justice as opposed to punitive  justice. Students should never be taken out of a classroom in handcuffs or for  extended periods of time as a form of punishment as those actions are  prohibitive to solving each student’s problems. I’m proud to work for a City  Council that has funded hundreds of social workers to get at the root of  individual student issues and am thankful that Mayor de Blasio, Chancellor  Carranza and Commissioner O’Neill have come to an agreement on the best path  forward for our youth who deal with so many issues at home, in schools and in  their community.” “Black  and Latinx students have been disproportionately impacted by policing in our  schools. This agreement will help reduce the interactions between police and  students, while leading to profound investments in Social-Emotional Learning  and Restorative Justice practices,” said Council Member Diana Ayala, Chair  of the City Council’s Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addiction .  “I thank Mayor de Blasio, Chancellor Carranza, and First Lady McCray for  pursuing these efforts, which will ensure our students can learn in safe,  supportive spaces.” “These  newly adopted Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice practices will  move our public schools forward by leaps and bounds,” said Council Member  Daniel Dromm . “Our schools must be safe, nurturing places for all students,  and this effort brings us closer toward achieving that goal. I am pleased that  the administration is embracing this progressive approach to school discipline  and learning, something for which my colleagues and I have long advocated. As  someone who taught in a NYC public school for over two decades, I thank the  Mayor, the First Lady and the Chancellor for prioritizing this important  effort.” “Students, parents, and elected officials have fought long  and hard to break the school to prison pipeline in New York City,” said Council  Member Antonio Reynoso . “A safe learning environment that is sensitive to  cultural and emotional needs is the foundation to keeping our kids in  classrooms where they belong and not behind bars. I thank Mayor de Blasio and  Chancellor Carranza for their newly announced investment in social-emotional  learning supports, an expanded restorative justice curriculum, and changes to  suspension protocol. Let’s continue to listen to our youth and provide what  they need to thrive.” Council  Member Alicka Ampry Samuel said, “This is one of the reasons why I love being a  New Yorker.  Today’s announcement of program initiatives directed towards  Social Emotional Learning will be a game changer for our school systems.  Education isn’t only about academics, this addresses the whole child.  I’m  glad NYC is leading the way to address the many needs of our youth in order to  provide the support they need to succeed in school and in life.” “This  newly announced school climate package contains demands that students, parents,  and educators have been organizing around for years,” said Kate McDonough,  Director of Dignity in Schools Campaign-NY . “It is a big step forward in  creating the schools that young people deserve.” “Instituting  Restorative Justice, increasing social emotional supports, and dismantling  punitive discipline in New York City's schools are critical and necessary steps  forward in both addressing systemic racism and ensuring justice for our youth”,  said Jennifer Jones, CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies .  “Today’s announcement evidences a sincere commitment to improving educational  and life outcomes for our students, especially those who’ve been  disproportionately impacted by disparate practices in the past.” “Today,  the Mayor, First Lady, and Chancellor have shown that they are accountable to  schools, parents, and students by making system level change that focuses on  building stronger students through increased mental health supports and  restorative justice to our schools. These changes bring our school communities  and city leadership closer to Justice and Equality,” said Dr. Hazel N.  Dukes, President of the NAACP New York State Conference . “We  applaud the Mayor, First Lady, and the Chancellor for not shying away from  their responsibility to our city’s future and addressing the social and  emotional needs of our youth across all of our New York City schools,” said Frankie  Miranda, Executive Vice President of Hispanic Federation . “For too long we  have watched policies centered on punitive measures derail the academic futures  of students and, in some instances, contribute to a school to prison pipeline.  Today’s announcement provides the opportunity to address the real and unique  challenges that our youth, especially our Latino and black students, are facing  in an increasingly challenging societal and political climate. Through  increased access to counselors and social workers, and less reliance on law  enforcement and detention, the city will be doing more to ensure a safe and  productive school environment that will keep students on track to graduation  and postsecondary success.” “Today’s  announcement by the mayor on the expansion of support for socioemotional learning/education,  the scaling and capacity building for restorative practices, and the overhaul  of how police operate in schools is game-changing,” said David Kirkland of  the NYU Metro Center. “Scholars, youth organizers, and civil rights  advocates have long pressed for the implementation of a critical sequence of  reforms that value and affirm the humanity of our students. The mayor’s  announcement is a win not only for those who have demanded more school  counselors, less in-school arrests, and greater attention to the non-cognitive  aspects of education, but also for a city positioned to lead the country in our  collective effort to advance equity and justice in education. This is a clear  statement in a long and continuing conversation about how education both requires  dignity and those of us who do education work to grapple with hard questions  about how to make schools work outside the peculiar and insidious impulse to  exclude, criminalize, vilify, and pass blame. Of course, there remains  significant work ahead of us; however, because of today’s announcement, we are  in a better position to move this work and this conversation forward.” “The  DOE's new initiative to reduce suspensions through efforts to promote Social  and Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice is sensible and long overdue,”  said Pedro A. Noguera, PhD, Faculty Director for the Center for the  Transformation of Schools at the UCLA Graduate School of Education &  Information Studies . “Schools can be safe and orderly without excluding  students who misbehave from learning opportunities. By addressing the cause of  behavior problems and improving the culture and climate of schools, suspensions  can be used as a last resort rather than the primary discipline strategy. If  implemented well the DOE strategy will help schools to create an environment  where teaching and learning can flourish while simultaneously increasing  support to our most vulnerable students.” “Police  presence in schools and a zero-tolerance disciplinary approach make students  feel like criminals in their own classrooms,” said Johanna Miller, Director  of the Education Policy Center at NYCLU . “Today’s announcement is  about treating kids like kids, allowing them to recover from mistakes, and  teaching them the tools to manage emotions and behavior. By adopting these  recommendations from the Leadership Team, the City is taking real a step  toward ending the School to Prison Pipeline.” “The  Children’s Defense Fund – New York commends the Mayor and Chancellor for taking  tremendous steps to advance education justice,” said Naomi Post, Executive  Director of the Children’s Defense Fund – New York . “Strengthening access  to restorative practices and social-emotional learning, clarifying the role of  police in schools, and proposing real changes to the Discipline Code will move  us much closer to addressing pervasive discipline disparities. We are  optimistic that these initiatives will promote the conditions necessary to  sustain positive school climates and transform learning throughout the city.” “I am gratified that my peers and I will have someone to talk to rather than  someone to talk at us. Progress is being made to support all students, but  specifically Black and Latinx students who have been disproportionately  penalized in schools,” said Marcus Altson, a Junior at Pace High School and  a member of Teens Take Charge and Organizing For Equity NY .  “Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice practices are an important  step to ending the school to prison pipeline. However, there is still work to  do to ensure that schools are places where all students feel supported and  safe.” “Students  belong in their classrooms, with their teachers and peers,” said Ben  West-Weyner, Co-Coordinator, Organizing For Equity NY . “This citywide move  toward Restorative Justice and away from exclusion will support educators in  fostering the loving school communities that our children deserve.” “It  is exciting that our community children and youth will be engaged academically  and emotionally,” said Pia J. Raymond, CEO of Creating Legacies . “I am  confident that the holistic approach to education, including the significant  addition of licensed social workers to our schools and modified implementation  of school safety procedure with the NYPD is invaluable in building dynamic,  self-aware and astute young leaders. I applaud Mayor Bill de Blasio, First Lady  Chirlane McCray and Chancellor Richard A. Carranza for their Social-Emotional  Learning and Restorative Justice initiative to empower students, teachers,  faculty and families across New York City.” “CCC applauds Mayor de Blasio for making these critical  commitments to NYC’s students,” said Jennifer March, Executive Director of  Citizens’ Committee for Children. “The multi-pronged strategies announced  today will go a long way toward combatting the school-to-prison pipeline and  keeping more students safe and in school. CCC supports efforts to invest in  Social-Emotional curricula and Restorative Justice practices as well those  aimed at reducing suspensions and arrests in schools. Together, these actions  will help students feel safe, welcomed, and supported in schools. CCC welcomes  the opportunity to work with the Department of Education to implement and  expand upon these important proposals.” “With most mental illnesses beginning during childhood, it is  essential that we offer children and schools the tools they need to move all  children toward greater mental health and, for those who need them, pathways to  recovery instead of incarceration,” said Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO,  Mental Health America . “This is a visionary plan that will make a huge  difference, and can serve as an example to other communities and public  officials.” “We  have had a long and valued relationship with New York City beginning with First  Lady Chirlane McCray’s commitment to  Mental Health First Aid training. With these actions, they are once  again proving themselves to be leaders by paving the way for children to access  better education, health and long-term success,” said Chuck Ingoglia,  president and CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health. “Research  shows Social-Emotional Learning plays a critical role in promoting student  success by increasing the likelihood of continued education, better mental  health, healthy relationships and reduced criminal behavior.” About  National University and Sanford Harmony The  private, nonprofit National University System was established to meet the  emerging challenges and demands of education in the 21st century.

Max Touhey The latest city budget includes $750,000 to grow an underutilized housing model that creates affordable homes in rapidly gentrifying communities—a major win for housing advocates. The funds will go toward incubating community land trusts (CLTs), or community-based nonprofits that sell housing or other buildings on property but retain ownership of the land. Elected officials and housing advocates tout the unique model as a way to create permanently affordable residential and commercial spaces, but a lack of funding can be a barrier to getting CLTs off the ground. Now, with the injection of dollars from the City Council, newly formed and existing CLTs will have sorely needed support. Manhattan councilmember Carlina Rivera, who is among a coalition of elected officials advocating for CLTs , said the budget win is a “great first step” toward recognizing and investing in the value of CLTs. “We have to use every tool in the tool box and I think this is one that has been dreadfully underutilized for decades,” Rivera told Curbed. “We’re not saying it’s a silver bullet—it’s one of the many things we have to do to address our affordable housing crisis.” By separating ownership of land from what is built on top of it, CLTs ensure that buildings cannot be sold for profit, thereby curbing speculation and serving as bulwarks against displacement and homelessness, advocates say. “We really are looking specifically for neighborhoods that may unfortunately be a part of the next gentrification wave—places like the South Bronx, Brownsville, Staten Island’s north shore,” said Rivera. “What we want to do is plant the seeds for these CLTs to grow.” The effort also has the backing of councilmembers Donovan Richards, Helen Rosenthal, and Mark Levine. The budget funds won’t go toward acquiring property for CLTs, but instead for the technical assistance, educational outreach, and organizing that must occur beforehand. Currently, there are 11 organizations with CLT projects across the five boroughs in neighborhoods such as Harlem, Edgemere, and Cypress Hills. Some incorporated recently are in the process of acquiring land, like the East Harlem El Barrio CLT , while others are in the midst of forming; Chhaya CDC , a nonprofit dedicated to the South Asian Community in Queens, aims to create a CLT in Jackson Heights. CLTs have a long history across the country and New York. The city’s oldest, the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association , dates back to 1991 and is located in Rivera’s district. To date, it has expanded to some 400 apartments and 20 small businesses. Over the years, councilmembers have invested in land trusts in their districts, but the $750,000 will foster a network of CLTs, allowing many of which are in the early phases to mature together. It’s a significant moment, according to Deyanira Del Rio, the board chair of the New York City Community Land Initiative and the co-director of the New Economy Project , which will coordinate the initiative. “It’s really the first of its kind in terms of citywide funding. For us, this feels like a huge step forward—like a leap forward,” said Del Rio. “It’s the first time a lot of these groups are going to have dedicated funding for their CLT organizing work, so it’s pretty powerful.” This is the second bid to fund the initiative. Organizers asked for some $735,000 last year but were unsuccessful. This budget season, advocates pushed for $850,000 to fund the entire program. The NYC Community Land Trust Initiative’s short-term goals include conducting education and organizing sessions for tenants and homeowners; providing technical assistance to emerging CLTs; and formalizing CLT incorporation and partnerships in all five boroughs. The chief long-term goal is to create thousands of units of affordable housing and commercial space for hundreds of small and cooperatively-owned businesses. This is often done by utilizing vacant city land. The model has again gained momentum in New York City in part due to a $3.5 million bank settlement negotiated by then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in 2017. The city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development distributed a $1.65 million grant from the settlement toward fostering CLTs, and this year, Attorney General Letitia James secured an $8 million bank settlement that will also go toward CLTs . Organizers hope the latest round of funding will give the city’s CLTs the shot in the arm needed to gain ground in the five boroughs. “We hope it signals the tide change,” said Del Rio. “We have these institutions forming—let’s make sure they can acquire property and have a real presence in their neighborhoods.” Next Up In NYC Affordable Housing Budget Cuts Might Doom de Blasio’s Affordable Housing Legacy New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board vote, explained What NYC could do with its $6 billion police budget NYC asks affordable housing developers to house more homeless New Yorkers New York City’s affordable HDFC co-ops, explained New York will offer mortgage relief during coronavirus pandemic. What about rents?  Filed under: NYC Affordable Housing NYC Affordable Housing Community land trusts score crucial funds in city budget The $750,000 will go toward fostering a city network of land trusts By Caroline Spivack Jun 18, 2019,  8:50am EDT Caroline Spivack Caroline Spivack Jun 18, 2019,  8:50am EDT    The budget funds will help foster community land trusts across the five boroughs. Max Touhey The latest city budget includes $750,000 to grow an underutilized housing model that creates affordable homes in rapidly gentrifying communities—a major win for housing advocates. The funds will go toward incubating community land trusts (CLTs), or community-based nonprofits that sell housing or other buildings on property but retain ownership of the land. Elected officials and housing advocates tout the unique model as a way to create permanently affordable residential and commercial spaces, but a lack of funding can be a barrier to getting CLTs off the ground. Now, with the injection of dollars from the City Council, newly formed and existing CLTs will have sorely needed support. Manhattan councilmember Carlina Rivera, who is among a coalition of elected officials advocating for CLTs , said the budget win is a “great first step” toward recognizing and investing in the value of CLTs. “We have to use every tool in the tool box and I think this is one that has been dreadfully underutilized for decades,” Rivera told Curbed. “We’re not saying it’s a silver bullet—it’s one of the many things we have to do to address our affordable housing crisis.” By separating ownership of land from what is built on top of it, CLTs ensure that buildings cannot be sold for profit, thereby curbing speculation and serving as bulwarks against displacement and homelessness, advocates say. “We really are looking specifically for neighborhoods that may unfortunately be a part of the next gentrification wave—places like the South Bronx, Brownsville, Staten Island’s north shore,” said Rivera. “What we want to do is plant the seeds for these CLTs to grow.” The effort also has the backing of councilmembers Donovan Richards, Helen Rosenthal, and Mark Levine. The budget funds won’t go toward acquiring property for CLTs, but instead for the technical assistance, educational outreach, and organizing that must occur beforehand. Currently, there are 11 organizations with CLT projects across the five boroughs in neighborhoods such as Harlem, Edgemere, and Cypress Hills. Some incorporated recently are in the process of acquiring land, like the East Harlem El Barrio CLT , while others are in the midst of forming; Chhaya CDC , a nonprofit dedicated to the South Asian Community in Queens, aims to create a CLT in Jackson Heights. CLTs have a long history across the country and New York. The city’s oldest, the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association , dates back to 1991 and is located in Rivera’s district. To date, it has expanded to some 400 apartments and 20 small businesses. Over the years, councilmembers have invested in land trusts in their districts, but the $750,000 will foster a network of CLTs, allowing many of which are in the early phases to mature together.

What to Know Two children -- a 10-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy -- were struck and killed by vehicles in East New York within about 48 hours The boy lost his life Thursday; it wasn't clear if the vehicle remained at the scene The little girl died Tuesday morning; she was struck and killed by a school bus less than 2 miles away. The driver was later arrested A 7-year-old boy was struck and killed by a car in  East New York Thursday, the second such tragedy in the Brooklyn neighborhood in three days. The child was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition after the accident near Blake and Pennsylvania avenues around 8:15 a.m. He later died from his injuries. The boy's mother was walking with him to school when they were struck; she was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. A deli counter clerk who says he knew the child's mother for years said he just saw her minutes before the tragedy. She got her coffee, banana and orange juice and left his shop, Omar Almansori said. Moments later, he heard screaming. Almansori says he ran outside and saw the inconsolable mother, who has three daughters in addition to the son she lost Thursday, screaming for help on the sidewalk. He saw her boy lying in the street; he wasn't moving. Another deli employee who was making sandwiches for some kids also rushed outside when he heard the commotion. Tony Ali says he knew the boy who died, that he was a good kid and had been a customer. "It was really hard, when you see a little kid," Ali said of the horror he saw outside. "Everybody was shocked. Some people was crying. Everybody stopped." The driver of the Jeep who hit the mother and child while turning right remained at the scene, crying. Police said the 48-year-old woman was driving with a suspended license, and officers asked her questions regarding the incident before taking her into custody. It was not immediately clear what charges she would face. Crossing guards were assigned to the intersection in the afternoon, hours after the fatal collision. Neighbors in the area say it's the first time they've seen them at this location, and it comes after now 22 pedestrians have been struck and killed in NYC streets so far in 2020. A transit safety group has called it a public health crisis. The tragedy happened barely 48 hours after a school bus struck and killed a 10-year-old girl less than two miles from the scene of Thursday's accident. Brooklyn Feb 26, 2020 School Bus Driver Arrested in Death of 10-Year-Old NYC Girl in Crosswalk Brooklyn Feb 25, 2020 Heartache, Tears After School Bus Kills 10-Year-Old NYC Girl The driver of that bus was later arrested. Pedro Colon faces charges of failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care in the death of Patience Albert, who was hit by the bus as Colon turned on Crescent Street, near Wortman Avenue. Police said late Tuesday Albert had been in the crosswalk with a 15-year-old boy when she was hit. The boy wasn't hurt. Colon stayed at the scene. The young girl was walking to school when she was struck and killed by a school bus, and now the community is demanding action to make the notorious intersection safer.

Temperatures in the city are forecasted to reach 100 degrees over the weekend. Credit... Desiree Rios for The New York Times By Kendra Pierre-Louis July 18, 2019 Two-thirds of the United States is expected to bake under what could be record high temperatures heading into the weekend. As a result, government agencies have issued warnings that can feel ominous. An “oppressive and dangerous heat ,” warned the National Weather Service. “Excessive heat, a ‘silent killer’,” echoed a news release by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Extreme heat is hazardous,” tweeted the NYC Emergency Management Department . But people with health issues, older people and young children are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. It’s a threat that grows as climate change continues. Climate change makes heat waves more frequent To understand how climate change increases the frequency of heat waves , it helps to think of the Earth’s temperature as a bell curve said Michael Mann, the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center. Climate change is shifting that bell curve toward the hotter part of the temperature scale. Even a tiny shift in the center means that more of the curve touches the extreme part of the temperature scale. “So you know, a warming of 1 degree Celsius, which is what we’ve seen thus far, can lead to a 10-fold increase in the frequency of 100 degree days in New York City for example,” said Dr. Mann. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program , since the 1960s the average number of heat waves — defined as two or more consecutive days where daily lows exceeded historical July and August temperatures — in 50 major American cities has tripled.

Then, he gleefully shared the results of her latest test. That series of statements sparked outrage among womenâs rights advocates and pretty much women in general. Part of that outrage stemmed from the fact that not a lot of people knew Virginity Testing was a thing. Those who did thought it was something that happened in far-off lands and in âother cultures." In truth, it happens right here, a lot. A 2016 report showed that one in 10 gynecologists had been asked to perform virginity tests on patients. The tests have been described as âintrusiveâ and âbarbaric,â and organizations like the World Health Organization, the United Nations and U.N.Women have demanded they be stopped. But how do you change cultural rituals that have been around for, in some cases, thousands of years.  Lori Sokol and Nayaba Arinde have been fighting for womenâs rights for a very long time. They join In Focus to talk about why this is wrong on so many levels. Dr. Deborah Ottenheimer is a womanâs health professional who has been asked by her patients to do virginity tests. Sheâll explain why, even though she knows they are meaningless and even though she knows the practice is wrong, she will do them when asked by the patient, though not the more intrusive tests.

They join In Focus to talk about why this is wrong on so many levels. Dr. Deborah Ottenheimer is a womanâs health professional who has been asked by her patients to do virginity tests. Sheâll explain why, even though she knows they are meaningless and even though she knows the practice is wrong, she will do them when asked by the patient, though not the more intrusive tests.

Since 1932, New Yorkers have been banished there when accused of a crime or a parole violation, or to serve short sentences. Tens of thousands of people cycle through Rikers each year, but until recently—when people and families who’d experienced the hell of Rikers began organizing to close it—it was almost invisible to the rest of New York City. So invisible that it wasn’t even labeled on the subway map. After enormous pressure, New York City is now on a path to close the nine jails there by 2026. While communities are still organizing for that closure to happen sooner, we now have a date on the horizon and the opportunity to envision what’s next for Rikers. As someone who has been held on Rikers (Harvey)—and tortured there, along with many of my family and neighbors in Mott Haven, I know that any future use of that land must be for the benefit of the people and communities who have been impacted. That is the bare minimum for New York City to begin repairing the harm Rikers has done to Black, Brown and working-class communities, and the trauma it has inflicted. Anyone who understands that trauma knows we should not be talking about using Rikers for affordable housing, or shelters, or mental health treatment facilities as some have suggested. 80 years of Rikers has shown that putting people who our City doesn’t want to deal with on an isolated and toxic island is a recipe for a human rights disaster. Plain and simple, human beings do not belong on Rikers Island. CityViews are readers’ opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today! But the closure of the Rikers jails gives us a once-in-a-generation chance to think about the infrastructure that our city needs now and will need in the future, as well as the infrastructure we currently have that harms environmental justice communities—who happen to be the very same communities who have been scarred by the impacts of Rikers. The Bronx, and specifically Hunts Point, knows these harms well. Burdened by hyper-polluting ‘peaker’ plants (opened as a “temporary” solution nearly 20 years ago, despite protests from residents), many diesel truck-based waste transfer stations,  and a noxious wastewater treatment plant, Hunts Points residents literally must struggle to breathe. THE POINT CDC, located in the heart of Hunts Point, strongly believes that establishing green infrastructure on Rikers Island will allow for more equitable and community-driven development.  Our Hunts Point communities are vulnerable to gentrification, displacement and climate change. The Renewable Rikers Plan allows for green infrastructure that will reduce environmental burdens within the South Bronx and help to move these communities towards a Just Transition that enables energy and waste equity and climate justice. Rikers exemplifies a system that has for decades represented a form of structural violence and been a symbol of a place you do not want to go to; it now should be used as an opportunity to repair and address many of the environmental and social injustices and disinvestment that the South Bronx has been victim to. Unsurprisingly, this confluence of injustices is repeated across many working-class communities of color in New York City. The plan known as Renewable Rikers gives us the opportunity to transfer Rikers Island from the control of the Department of Corrections to the control of the Department of Environmental Protection to direct the Island’s green infrastructure uses and establish green energy and wastewater treatment infrastructure there. The benefits that could flow from this plan are enormous—our city can simultaneously expand its capacity to generate and store clean energy; reduce pollution in our waterways; divert organic waste for anaerobic digestion; close power plants and wastewater plants that are making us sick; open up precious waterfront land for community for public space, parks, or affordable housing; and create green jobs. Last summer, the #CLOSErikers campaign organized forums in every borough, in the communities that have been most impacted by mass incarceration. We asked residents how Rikers should be remembered and heard a lot of ideas about how to make sure that when Rikers is gone, we never forget what happened there. Certainly, those of us who have been there cannot forget. Suggestions included educating the public through creating a curriculum for schools, developing mobile exhibits, and establishing monuments or markers throughout the City. People also spoke about reparative justice and the idea that the best way to acknowledge and address the brutal legacy of Rikers is to invest in the well-being of the people and communities that it has most harmed. For many decades, working-class communities of color have struggled against the devastating and overlapping impacts of environmental injustice and mass incarceration. The Renewable Rikers Plan gives New York City the chance to be a leader in both decarceration and environmental justice. And like closing the Rikers jails, the time to move it forward is now. Harvey Murphy is an organizer with JustLeadershipUSA, a leader in the #CLOSEikers campaign, and resident of Mott Haven.

The homes are each worth roughly $1.75 million, but the combined property tax bill is slightly under $9,000 — far less than homes of comparable value in less gentrified parts of New York, like the Bronx or Staten Island. Yet the owner of the houses , Mayor Bill de Blasio, said on Friday that he welcomed a chance to make the property tax system more equitable. A few blocks away, Daniel Fountaine was more uncertain. He bought a two-bedroom apartment in a co-op building with views of Prospect Park in 1985 for only $175,000. As the price of his home soared, he became, at least on paper, a millionaire. But Mr. Fountaine, an 84-year-old former accountant, is retired and on a fixed income. He said he can barely afford his annual $5,000 property tax bill — still far less than similarly priced homes in the suburbs, or even in Canarsie, Brooklyn, just six miles away — and cannot afford to pay significantly more. “It’s too stressful to move,” he said on Friday. “What the hell are you going to do?” Image Daniel Fountaine, a retiree on a fixed income, said he feared that he would not be able to pay higher property taxes, under a new system being considered by New York City.

Federal Relief Newsroom News Releases AQE in the News News Releases AQE in the News DONATE Search for: Educational Equity Educational Equity Money matters; without adequate resources, schools cannot educate students. The availability of resources closely correlates with opportunities and outcomes. We believe school aid distribution should be based on student and school district need. New York currently ranks 49th in the nation on equity in education spending. The Campaign for Fiscal Equity The Campaign for Fiscal Equity (CFE) was created by parents who filed a lawsuit against the State of New York, claiming that children were not being provided the opportunity to an adequate education. In 2006, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled in CFE’s favor, and found that New York State is violating students constitutional right to a “sound and basic education” by leaving schools without the funding necessary.  As a result of the ruling, schools were ordered to receive $5.5 billion increase in basic operating aid (also known as Foundation Aid) statewide over the course of a four year phase-in from 2007 to 2011. What is the Foundation Aid Formula? This formula was created in response to the CFE ruling to distribute state aid based on student need. It accounts for the ability of the school district or city to raise money from local property taxes and was intended to close the spending gap between districts and create an equitable education system for all students. You can learn more about how the formula works here. Looking Toward the Future In 2021, New York State at last committed to a three-year phase-in of the Foundation Aid owed to schools. It fulfilled that phase-in commitment with the 2023-24 budget. Now, with public schools fully funded under the Foundation Aid formula, it is time for the New York State Education Department (NYSED) to take a critical look at how the formula can be improved to ensure it is delivering the resources necessary to provide an equitable and adequately funded public education to all New York students. AQE and the Education Law Center of New Jersey released a joint report with recommendations on how to improve the Foundation Aid formula, to better reflect advancements in the field of school finance, changes in the state’s curricular standards, and evolving expectations of the programs and services needed to support students’ academic and social-emotional wellbeing.

On Friday, Council Speaker Corey Johnson wrote to Secretary of Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg to "implore" him to "immediately authorize the implementation of New York City’s landmark congestion pricing plan [which is] absolutely vital to the city’s short- and long-term recovery from COVID-19." Before President Biden took office on Wednesday, the prior administration had willfully failed to tell state officials which type of environmental review they would need to conduct regarding any impacts of congestion tolling — a full environmental impact statement, or a truncated environmental impact assessment. That failure to notify the state was the key hurdle to getting the revenue-raising plan in place by January, 2021 (which, as we all know, did not happen). In his letter, Johnson said the Trump administration acted "nefariously" in delaying its decision on which kind of environmental review the state must undertake — a seemingly absurd hurdle that nonetheless barred any action. Congestion tolls, which were approved in 2019, would raise $1 billon per year, which would support $15 billion in borrowing. The MTA's 2020-24 capital plan — the largest in its history — was built largely on anticipated revenue from the central business district tolling. As a result, much of that capital plan has been shelved. Johnson is displeased. "Even before the coronavirus devastated our city, New York City’s subway system was facing a crisis of unreliable service and ridership decline," his letter states. "The implementation of congestion pricing promised to help address this emergency by imposing a small toll on drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street." The billion dollars, he added, "would help to fund long-overdue capital upgrades for our century-old subway system, including modernizing signals and installing elevators." And in case incoming Secretary Buttigieg didn't know, Johnson reiterated that congestion pricing has the broad support of a "diverse coalition of community stakeholders, businesses, labor unions, straphangers, traffic experts, transit advocates, and elected officials." That includes Mayor de Blasio, though Hizzoner has not spoken to President Biden or his team about congestion pricing yet, a spokesman said on Friday. On the Brian Lehrer show on Friday, the mayor had a great opportunity to bring up congestion pricing, but did not do so. When asked about former city DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg's selection to be Buttigieg's top deputy, de Blasio said all of the right things (except he left out congestion pricing: Polly Trottenberg was a great commissioner of Transportation for this city and she was with me the entire run of this administration. And she did an amazing job and many accomplishments, but I keep coming back to Vision Zero. She was one of the key architects of Vision Zero. And I think she's going to help make that a national vision, which we need. I think with her as the number two person at Department of Transportation, we're going to see a lot more aid to mass transit, a lot more directed locally to the things that make an impact, a lot more support for bike lanes, a lot more support for Vision Zero efforts. And that's going to be funding first and foremost, undoubtedly, but I also think the policies are going to change to support these kinds of efforts. And Polly agrees, you know, centrally, we all agree. We got to get away from the automobile more and more. I mean, that's the central thrust here is we got to reorient our society away from cars and more and more towards mass transit and all other forms of transit. I think Polly's going to make a huge impact. I'm very proud of her.

I think Polly's going to make a huge impact. I'm very proud of her. Pride, of course, goeth before the fall. And Amtrak-loving president and former DOT commissioner as a high official or not, the MTA is facing what Johnson called "a staggering $16-billion deficit through 2024." Certainly, the city and state will ask for more money, but Johnson focused his attention on congestion pricing, because it requires so little of the federal government. "The implementation of congestion pricing has the capacity to generate significant urgently-needed revenue that will help prevent our public transit system from going down a death spiral of service cuts and fare hikes that will disproportionately harm the city’s working families," he wrote. "With the positive environmental impacts that we can expect from reductions in traffic and the increased use of public transit due to congestion pricing, I believe an expedited environmental review is appropriate." A spokesman for U.S. DOT could not immediately comment on Johnson's letter, but during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Buttigieg seemed very supportive of many of Johnson's arguments, as Streetsblog reported . It is unclear if Gov. Cuomo has spoken to President Biden about congestion pricing. He had not brought it up in a call back in November , after the untainted election. And Cuomo never even complained to then-President Trump about his recalcitrance.

About 30 Jun 2020 Supporting the East New York Community Land Trust: A tool to Increase and Protect Affordable Homeownership (OPINION) Houses on Drew Street. Liena Zagare/Bklyner By Afiya Lahens, Niani Taylor and Albert Scott Jr. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States with hopes and promises of a better tomorrow. Many naively believed Obama’s election single handedly ended racism and the American dream was truly possible for all. His election came at the height of a financial crisis where housing foreclosures were at an all-time high in neighborhoods across America. East New York, a microcosm of the effects of the failed housing market, saw one of the highest foreclosure rates in New York City–it impacted over 2,000 East New York households. Black and Brown residents who make up a large share of East New York’s population became vulnerable to exacerbated predatory housing practices, leading to an ever widening of the racial wealth gap. Twelve years since Obama’s inauguration, “I can’t breathe” , the last words of Eric Garner and now George Floyd, have been utilized as a slogan for the #BlackLivesMatter movement signifying the chokehold of oppression and police brutality. For weeks people of all colors have been chanting these words in cities across America demanding the change Obama’s election promised years ago. Although protests have mainly focused on police reform, communities are now more emboldened than ever to fight systemic racism in all aspects of life such as education, healthcare, and housing. In East New York, residents have already decided that they want change! By 2017, Brooklyn’s Community District 5 (which includes the communities of Cypress Hills, East New York, and Starrett City), reported having the third highest new foreclosure rates out of New York City’s 59 community districts. According to the report East New York: Homeownership Trends in a Working Neighborhood, published by the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, CD-5 also has the highest rate of tax and water debt sold through the City’s annual tax lien sale. Instead of home sales going to new low-and-moderate income homeowners, real estate LLCs are buying up homes and flipping them for a profit. In fact, from January to March of this year, 60% of the 95 homes purchased in CD-5 were by real estate LLCs. Financially struggling households find themselves increasingly vulnerable to housing scams hinting towards a pattern of gentrification seen in various neighborhoods throughout the city. There is a dire lack of affordable homeownership opportunities in East New York. Tired of decades of discrimination and predatory housing practices, residents are demanding change and understand that they must take matters into their own hands. Community members have mobilized around a unique approach to tackling economic and housing injustices through the creation of the East New York Community Land Trust (ENY CLT) Initiative. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are non-profit organizations governed by a board of residents, community members, and public representatives that provide lasting community assets such as shared equity homeownership opportunities, affordable rental and cooperative housing projects, as well as the conservation of land or urban green spaces. CLTs are a tool for community wealth-building by arming residents with financial literacy, community organizing experience and stable and affordable housing. The only fully established CLT in NYC as of 2019 was the Cooper Square CLT. However, as of last year, and due to the $855,000 in discretionary funding that the City invested in the Community Land Trust Initiative, there are upwards of a dozen CLT’s that have been established or are en route to being established. The ENY CLT is one of those. As proud members of the ENY CLT, we have witnessed how empowered volunteers are working to make the CLT a reality and give our community a fighting chance against gentrification and displacement. We are asking that the City Council renew funding for the CLT initiative so that we can continue to grow our CLT. The City has already pledged to temporarily end the pilot program that would legalize basements as apartments, another form of affordable residential living. This was a promise made through the ENY Rezoning. The City Council and the Mayor should not fail East New Yorkers by ending funding for CLTs. We cannot be a community that gets the shortest end of the stick during these times. This is especially true when a neighborhood like Starrett City, located within Community District 5, has seen the most amount of deaths out of any other NYC community.

Educators, students and parents in Bushwick, Brooklyn, turned out in force at a hearing on Feb. 10 to protest the proposed expansion of a charter school in their district. The charter school — Math, Engineering and Science Academy (MESA), which serves grades 9 through 12 — shares a building with JHS 291 and Bushwick Community HS. Under the proposed charter revision, MESA would expand to grades 6–8 and enroll an additional 300 students. Community members at the hearing strongly opposed the proposal, pointing out that MESA's expansion into the middle school grades would compete with District 32's existing eight middle schools. "We already have a school that offers Regents credits and other programs in this very building," said Veronica Wilensky-Sorkin, the UFT's District 32 representative. "It does not make sense to take more space and resources from our community public schools." Wearing matching T-shirts in support of JHS 291 and Bushwick Community HS, students and parents chanted "Don't squeeze us out" and "You expand, we expire!" during the contentious hearing. "I'm here to show respect for my school and for my teachers, because they've done a lot for me," said Joshua Morgan, a student at Bushwick Community HS. "This isn't just a school; this is my family." Catherine Rhee, the chapter leader at JHS 291, said, "Everything MESA wants to offer, we already provide. We deserve to continue thriving." MESA representatives announced at the hearing they don't plan to seek additional space in their current building. It is not yet clear where the proposed middle school would be located. Wilensky-Sorkin said a co-location in another District 32 school would be equally detrimental. "They are not welcome anywhere in Bushwick," she said. Several members of the District 32 Community Education Council and representatives of local elected officials also spoke against the proposal, saying  another charter school inside a public school building would sow further divisions in the community. Teachers at both public schools said charter schools in District 32 have gained a reputation for cherry-picking students. Alona Phillips, who has taught at JHS 291 for 20 years, noted many students who arrive at the school say they have been pushed out of local charter schools. "Charter schools have discarded our special needs students, and they take funding away from our community," she told the crowd. "We're a transfer high school, which means that our students have already been through at least one other school, and many of them have come from charter schools," said Gabrielle Troya, a special education teacher at Bushwick Community HS. "Our students need space to build that sense of community."

By Contributed Content UPDATED: February 13, 2020 at 3:56 PM EST At just 17 years old, I can’t count the number of times my friends and I have had no choice but to be one another’s support system through personal battles with our mental health. New York City’s public schools are to blame. I attend a high school with more than 400 students and there is only one dedicated therapist to counsel hundreds of young people. According to the New York City Department of Education’s “ Report on Guidance Counselors ,” in 2018, there were 2,881 guidance counselors (77 of whom were part-time) and 1,335 social workers serving the 1.1 million students in the city’s public schools. That means, on average, there was one guidance counselor per 381 students and just one social worker per 716 students. It is absurd to expect a meaningful and positive change to students’ wellbeing under these circumstances. Having insufficient support staff during such a pivotal period of development in our lives means we are left to fend for ourselves. There is only so much that students with no experience in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, social work and therapy can do to help one another deal with such monumental struggles. We are a generation of young adults about to head off into the world with unresolved trauma , mental health issues and minimal mental health support in our schools. We deserve more from our schools and elected leaders. For communities of color, in particular, talking about mental health can be an extreme taboo –– even more so when the person suffering is a child or young adult. Young people of color are often taught to be strong, “toughen up,” not to cry, to keep busy, and get over issues by ignoring them or “pushing through.” The current ratio of counselors to students is a clear message from the city’s education decision-makers that they have the same expectation. For teens like me, the struggle to lead an emotionally healthy life as a young person of color is already a herculean task, made even more difficult when institutions that are meant to help, fail us. More than 80% of NYC’s public school students are people of color. Predominately black and Latino schools, however, receive fewer financial resources , fewer opportunities and more policing than do schools with majority-white student bodies. It is sometimes said that budgets are moral documents. If that holds true, then the morality of the city’s public schools is questionable given the lack of funding for student support staff. The budget for the NYC Department of Education this year is $34 billion . There are resources available for investing in our mental health, but it has to be made a far larger priority. Instead, as it was announced recently , precious resources are being set aside to increase the number of police in our already over-policed schools. It is time we stop ignoring poor mental health in schools and prioritize the mental wellbeing of youth, dismantle institutions that say otherwise, and put front and center the health of New York City’s most vulnerable young people. Mendez Ventura is a high school senior in Manhattan and a member of The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, a Harlem-based nonprofit.

In New York City, we operate the first alternative-to-incarceration and victim-service program in the United States that focuses on violent felonies in the adult courts. Locally and nationally, we leverage the lessons from our direct service to transform the justice system through partnerships, advocacy, and elevating the experience and power of those most impacted. Rigorous and hopeful, we build practical strategies to hold people accountable for harm, break cycles of violence, and secure safety, healing, and justice for survivors and their communities. Please enable “Advertisement cookies” to view this video Our Work We Work to Build Transformative Solutions to Violence That Can Displace Incarceration Pragmatic and optimistic, we begin this work in practice. In NYC, Common Justice engages younger adults (ages 16 to 26) and those they have harmed in a rigorous and cutting-edge alternative to incarceration and victim service program. If the harmed parties agree, violent felony cases such as robbery and assault are diverted from the criminal legal system into a restorative justice process that gives participants the power and opportunity to collectively identify and address impacts, needs, and obligations, in order to heal and make things as right as possible. The agreements that emerge from these dialogues, together with the violence intervention curriculum, replace the prison sentences our responsible parties would otherwise have served, and we provide wraparound supports to our harmed parties to support them in coming through what happened to them and in their lives generally. advocacy advocacy work We are a team of change-makers, who believe that we can make a difference by addressing violence through community-based solutions and centering the needs of survivors. The Narrative Shifting the Narrative Around Violence Our national story about violence has helped give rise to mass incarceration. The United States incarcerates more people than any other nation in the world. At the same time, there are grave inequities in our treatment of crime victims, who pay the price for prison’s failure to deliver on its promise of safety. To talk responsibly about violence, it is essential to place the people who survive it at the center. This does not currently happen. Legislators have enacted draconian criminal justice laws in the names of survivors. Others have drawn on crime victims’ stories to motivate sympathy, horror, and outrage. But the one thing rarely done is to ask the full range of survivors what they want. Common Justice is committed to telling the truth about violence—about the people who survive it, the people who cause it, and the strategies that will work to end it. We are sharing what we have learned in our decade of work addressing violence without prison. We are working with our partners to establish a new way forward. In doing so, we know no one can tell these stories better than the people whose lives are at stake, so we are working to create broad new platforms to elevate their voices and leadership from the block to the Capitol.”   team The Common Justice Team We are a team of change-makers, who believe that we can make a difference by addressing violence through community-based solutions and centering the needs of survivors. Fair Access The Fair Access To Victim Compensation Campaign The Fair Access To Victim Compensation Campaign is a state-wide campaign, led by several local New York-based groups and national organizations who are fighting for expanded and equitable access to victim compensation funds. Currently in New York State, survivors of violence are subject to onerous law enforcement reporting requirements when filing for victim compensation funds, and barred from access if they allegedly contributed to the crime in question or failed to show physical injury associated with their harm. This denies resources to countless survivors that could be used to pay for medical bills, funeral expenses, replacement of personal property, relocation expenses, and other costs associated with the harm they experienced. Training New York City Collaborative to Transform Violence The New York City Collaborative to Transform Violence aims to close that gap by bringing together people in CVI work in New York City into an 8-month cohort-based learning collaborative to integrate an understanding and basic practice of restorative justice into their work.

Jerry Iannelli Jul 22, 2020 Share Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Bluesky WhatsApp Reddit LinkedIn Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the population of New York City’s jails has been nearly halved. According to New York state data, the city’s average daily jail population dropped from 7,214 people in June 2019 to 3,878 in June 2020—a 46 percent decline . And according to the most recent jail reduction fact sheet from the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, the city released nearly 3,400 people from local jails between March 16 and May 25 alone . These releases most likely represent the largest single cut to the city’s jail population in history. Housing rights advocates, however, warn that a significant percentage of the people released will most likely have nowhere to go unless the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) curtails longstanding policies that have discriminated against justice-involved people or the previously incarcerated. A previously unreported May 6 letter from a  group of 20 housing rights advocacy organizations demanded that NYCHA end long-criticized policies that bar recently arrested people from even visiting the city’s 326 public housing facilities. These policies include provisions allowing NYCHA to banish recently arrested people for years or, worse, permanently bar children as young as 16 from living with their families in public housing. The letter’s signatories—including the Vera Institute of Justice, Legal Aid Society, and John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York’s Institute for Justice and Opportunity—wrote that unless NYCHA significantly changes course, its policies will force many of the people recently released from jail during the pandemic right into homelessness. “We appreciate that the City and State have taken steps to stem the spread of the coronavirus in jails and prisons and keep our communities safe, though work here is not done and each should release many more people,” the letter states. “However, we are concerned about the dire emergency housing needs of justice-involved people due to early release. New York City is already in the midst of a housing crisis, and more than half of the people who come home from prison each year are released into homelessness. Many of the people being released may be former NYCHA residents and/or still have family living in NYCHA developments.” In June, the agency responded to the advocates’ open letter by stating it would temporarily waive some guest-visitation restrictions and speed up reviews for those who ask to overturn permanent bans from city properties. “We know that it is imperative for NYCHA to continue to update its policies to ensure we provide fair and just access to housing while also balancing community safety goals,” NYCHA chairperson and CEO Gregory Russ wrote in a June 12 letter obtained by The Appeal. But in an email to NYCHA also obtained by The Appeal, the advocates wrote that the agency’s proposed changes weren’t acceptable. “We are disappointed with NYCHA’s response to our request and to the crisis,” the group wrote. “The changes NYCHA is making to the temporary guest policy do nothing to address the housing needs of criminal legal system-impacted individuals during a global pandemic. Those needs are the entire reason underlying our request.” In an email to The Appeal, a NYCHA spokesperson said the agency will continue to examine its policies amid the pandemic. “NYCHA is currently reviewing our policies related to criminal justice involvement as we strive to balance the safety of our residents and the needs of those formerly incarcerated long term,” the spokesperson said. “To immediately respond to the issues raised during the current COVID-19 crisis, we worked to create an electronic PE Lift process and are temporarily allowing visitors to remain on NYCHA properties while they await their application reviews.” The Appeal in Your Inbox Subscribe to our newsletters for regular updates, analysis and context straight to your email. Sign Up NYCHA maintains some of the strictest eviction policies in the nation. Those arrested on misdemeanor charges can be banned from public housing facilities for a minimum of three years, while those arrested on felony charges can be banned for up to six . Anyone caught committing a crime on NYCHA grounds can be banished for the rest of their lives, and those caught harboring unauthorized people can themselves then be evicted as well. Standards for “permanent exclusion” are far more subjective than those in criminal court; NYCHA maintains the right to evict tenants for conduct it says endangers “the health and safety of other tenants,” or for “sex or morals” offenses, “common law nuisance[s], and other similarly vague categories. “A person who’s excluded is not even allowed to visit for Christmas or birthdays,” Nora Reissig, the former director of NYCHA’s Department of Family Services, told The Appeal. “This tears families apart. For most families that’s a joyous event, but not if you have somebody who has to sneak in or hide if anyone knocks on the door.” In 2013, the New York Times reported that roughly 1,500 recent parolees had listed NYCHA properties as their home address and thus were most likely living unauthorized in public housing. In 2016, the Village Voice profiled Darnell Smith, who said he was living unauthorized in his family’s Harlem apartment after leaving prison and repeatedly hid in a closet from NYCHA investigators to make sure his wife and children did not get evicted. In 2013, Reissig helped NYCHA and the Vera Institute of Justice launch what is now known as NYCHA’s Family Reentry Program, which was then a pilot project. It allows incarcerated people to return to NYCHA housing immediately after leaving prison . In 2016, Vera reported that just one of the initial 85 participants was convicted of a new charge while in the program. Although NYCHA has since made the Family Reentry Program permanent, advocates for the formerly imprisoned say the program reviews and approves far too few applications each year and is not prepared for the influx of people released amid the pandemic. JoAnne Page, president of the Fortune Society (another nonprofit that signed the May 6 letter), told The Appeal that she was disappointed that NYCHA hadn’t expanded the re-entry program before the pandemic hit. She referenced a study showing that in 2017 more than half of those released from New York state prisons move directly into homeless shelters —and said that many of those people could potentially find homes with families in NYCHA properties. “Permanent exclusion has a disparate impact on people of color,” she said. “You have to look at the damage it does to the poorest New Yorkers. When you look through a racial-equity lens, there’s an additional impetus to change a policy that, just like what you have in the criminal justice system, disproportionately impacts people of color and their families.” Similarly, Kinshasa Hillery, director of the Legal Empowerment and Assistance Program at RiseBoro Community Partnership (a nonprofit that signed the May letter), told The Appeal that she’s seen NYCHA bring eviction proceedings against one woman with mental illness who allowed an unauthorized visitor to enter her home. “They just need to see an arrest record,” she said. “They can put you through eviction proceedings regardless of the outcome of actual criminal proceedings. It’s always been a very powerful tool for NYCHA to over-police and overregulate its community.” In the May 6 letter, housing advocates asked NYCHA for four specific changes: waive temporary-guest requirements for a minimum of six months and commit to not evicting anyone who brings in an unauthorized guest for the next year, temporarily suspend permanent-exclusion inspections,  automatically lift any permanent exclusion more than five years old, ensure that every tenant is properly informed if NYCHA changes any of the aforementioned policies. Instead, the agency offered a compromise that advocates say is inadequate. In its June 12 response, NYCHA wrote that temporary guests will be allowed to stay in public housing while their applications are pending (NYCHA typically has 60 days to approve or deny a visitation request) and, if denied, will be given 30 days to submit documents showing any unauthorized tenants have left the property. NYCHA also said it would “expedite” re-entry reviews, but only for people who requested the review, which critics say is a difficult and byzantine process. “By continuing to penalize residents and applicants with conviction histories, NYCHA is relying on a fundamentally racist and unjust system and is a part of the system of perpetual punishment faced by over-policed communities of color,” the advocates wrote back. “It is unsupportable for NYCHA to continue its policies that preclude the victims of this unjust system from being able to live with, or even visit, their families. NYCHA must reckon with its own racist policies and practices and the ways in which it, as a landlord, oppresses people of color.” Support The Appeal If you valued this article, please help us produce more journalism like this by making a contribution today .

City officials are looking to capitalize on a distressed tourism industry by converting commercial hotels into affordable housing — including creating single room occupancy units known as SROs. The exploration of cheaper alternatives for affordable housing and supportive housing — offering health care and social services for people with mental illness or substance abuse disorders — comes as the city struggles to overcome a fiscal crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. The effort, which also comes as thousands of homeless people are staying in hotels, highlights just how hard a near-halt in business travel and tourism is slamming New York City. “Unfortunately, we’re seeing a tremendous hit to our hotels because of the reduction in tourism, because of the lack of travel — and hopefully most of that will come back. But some of it may not,” Vicki Been, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said this week during an online roundtable on economic development hosted by the Real Estate Board of New York and the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Deputy Mayor for Housing and Economic Development Vicki Been speaks during a City Hall coronavirus press conference, March 12, 2020. Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY “So we’ve been looking hard at — are there hotels that we could acquire to turn into supportive housing rather than having to build from ground up?” she added. “We’re looking both at, are there assets that we own that we can make available to affordable housing or other needs — and are there private market buildings that we could acquire to convert into affordable housing at a cheaper cost.” Department of Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Louise Carroll, who also participated in the event, said hotels are also under consideration for a shared housing model — which includes SRO-like units that have common areas for residents. The agency has been testing shared and co-living spaces as affordable housing since 2018.

The number of SRO units in the city has decreased from a high of more than 200,000 in the 1950s to as few as 30,000 today, according to supportive housing advocates. The purge began when city officials deemed SROs to be substandard housing — and made it illegal to build new units beginning in the 1960s. Eager Sellers The hotel conversions could offer a cost-effective way to create affordable housing on a large scale, say the supportive housing developers and operators , much less expensively than building from the ground up. More than $1 billion in planned spending on affordable housing for the fiscal year that ends Tuesday and the one that begins July 1 would be delayed by two years under Mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposed capital budget, the Independent Budget Office reported Monday. That budget is in its final days of negotiation with the City Council. De Blasio has set a goal of building and preserving 300,000 units of affordable housing by 2026. The IBO report found that through March, the city had financed just over 164,000 units — of which 70% were preserved through refinancing and upgrades rather than new construction.

Revenues were down 82.6% compared to the same month last year, the data shows, to about $166 million. About 13,000 homeless people — or nearly one-quarter of the city’s total homeless population — are among those staying at commercial hotels, according to department of homeless services officials.

Leaders in the hotel and corporate sectors said they see the city’s explorations as an accurate reflection of conditions on the ground for the foreseeable future. Vijay Dandapani, CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, said the financial realities for some hotel owners will align with the city’s interests. “In this particularly stressful time with virtually no revenues, we expect there will be a high degree of interest from some owners,” said Dandapani. “It is pretty much a certainty that the hotel industry won’t be able to recover in any meaningful way till at least late 2023, and more likely early 2024.” As many as 20% of the city’s more than 125,000 hotel rooms may not reopen, The Wall Street Journal recently reported . Kathryn Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, said hotels had been overbuilt before the coronavirus crisis, and that soaring real estate costs had made it difficult to develop affordable housing. “We support the idea of trying to find public use for distressed assets,” she said. “To the extent the pandemic creates some opportunities to acquire properties cheaply and repurpose them to meet community needs, that would be one of few good outcomes of this horrible crisis.” Housing at Half the Cost When supportive housing first took off as a model starting in the 1970s, conversions of aging hotel buildings were common. Former hotels that remain residences today include the Prince George in Flatiron and Muhlenberg Residence in downtown Brooklyn. If the city moves forward now, it wouldn’t be the first conversion by the de Blasio administration of a former hotel site into affordable and supportive housing. In 2018, the supportive housing nonprofit Breaking Ground purchased a former residential hotel on Sands Street that was part of a Jehovah’s Witnesses complex in Dumbo, Brooklyn. With a $157 million loan from HPD, the site is now poised to serve as 200 units of affordable housing and 300 units of supportive housing, according to Breaking Ground’s CEO, Brenda Rosen. Rosen said an SRO model would be particularly well-suited for distressed hotels in Manhattan, which can be converted into supportive housing for as little as $250,000 per unit — half the cost of new construction. “There are thousands of hotel rooms being used as shelter right now, and the question is, does it make sense to think about these hotels as some sort of permanent supportive housing and would it make sense in terms of structure and time and cost?” said Rosen. “It really could be a huge benefit to the city, especially at a time of fiscal constraint.” Related Yoav Gonen Senior Reporter ygonen@thecity.nyc Yoav is a senior reporter for THE CITY, where he covers NYC government, politics and the police department.

Before you go… for all things NYC.  City officials are looking to capitalize on a distressed tourism industry by converting commercial hotels into affordable housing — including creating single room occupancy units known as SROs. The exploration of cheaper alternatives for affordable housing and supportive housing — offering health care and social services for people with mental illness or substance abuse disorders — comes as the city struggles to overcome a fiscal crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. The effort, which also comes as thousands of homeless people are staying in hotels, highlights just how hard a near-halt in business travel and tourism is slamming New York City. “Unfortunately, we’re seeing a tremendous hit to our hotels because of the reduction in tourism, because of the lack of travel — and hopefully most of that will come back. But some of it may not,” Vicki Been, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said this week during an online roundtable on economic development hosted by the Real Estate Board of New York and the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY Credit: “So we’ve been looking hard at — are there hotels that we could acquire to turn into supportive housing rather than having to build from ground up?” she added. “We’re looking both at, are there assets that we own that we can make available to affordable housing or other needs — and are there private market buildings that we could acquire to convert into affordable housing at a cheaper cost.” Department of Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Louise Carroll, who also participated in the event, said hotels are also under consideration for a shared housing model — which includes SRO-like units that have common areas for residents. The agency has been testing shared and co-living spaces as affordable housing since 2018.

The number of SRO units in the city has decreased from a high of more than 200,000 in the 1950s to as few as 30,000 today, according to supportive housing advocates. The purge began when city officials deemed SROs to be substandard housing — and made it illegal to build new units beginning in the 1960s. Eager Sellers The hotel conversions could offer a cost-effective way to create affordable housing on a large scale, say the supportive housing developers and operators , much less expensively than building from the ground up. More than $1 billion in planned spending on affordable housing for the fiscal year that ends Tuesday and the one that begins July 1 would be delayed by two years under Mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposed capital budget, the Independent Budget Office reported Monday. That budget is in its final days of negotiation with the City Council. De Blasio has set a goal of building and preserving 300,000 units of affordable housing by 2026. The IBO report found that through March, the city had financed just over 164,000 units — of which 70% were preserved through refinancing and upgrades rather than new construction.

Revenues were down 82.6% compared to the same month last year, the data shows, to about $166 million. About 13,000 homeless people — or nearly one-quarter of the city’s total homeless population — are among those staying at commercial hotels, according to department of homeless services officials.

Email address   Email address    Published Mar 18, 2020 Share Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations An emergency paid sick leave bill giving mandatory sick leave for many employees with COVID-19 or under government-order quarantine related to the outbreak has passed in the State Senate. The bill comes after state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo came to an agreement on Tuesday after uncertainties of whether the state legislature could fast-track high-priority bills like paid sick leave during the pandemic. Confirmed cases of coronavirus have reached 2,382 in the state as of Wednesday. "The single most effective way to contain the spread of this virus is to ensure people who may have come into contact with it do not interact with others," Cuomo said in a statement. The legislation will require that large employers—100 or more employees—and all public employers provide 14 days of paid sick leave. Those with 11 to 99 employees, or with 10 or fewer employees but more than $1 million in net income, must provide five days of paid sick leave and then unpaid leave during the quarantine order. Employers with less than 10 employees but a net income less than $1 million won't be required to offer paid sick leave, but their employees must be granted unpaid leave until the quarantine is lifted. The bill also includes job protections for employees during the quarantine period. While advocates applauded the paid sick leave deal, they also pointed out gaps in coverage for independent workers, especially delivery workers, who are expected to be an increasingly critical aspect of New York City life under a possible shelter-in-place scenario . Make the Road New York's co-executive director Deborah Axt said Cuomo's announcement was a "critical step for working New Yorkers," but "while this package will help many people, it risks excluding large portions of working people across the state." "Governor Cuomo and the legislature should also address the critical situation of independent contractors, small businesses, and immigrant workers who have had their incomes cut off or who are running the great personal risks, taking care of the delivery, food, healthcare and transportation needs of the rest of us in this terrifying time," Axt said in a statement. Already, restrictions on restaurants and bars to shift to delivery and takeout have made servers and bartenders wonder where their next paycheck will come. Food vendors, many of whom are immigrants , have seen business plummet as New Yorkers stay home. Delivery cyclists are becoming "frontline workers" amid the crisis—but face their own safety issues without proper protective gear and paid sick leave, since many are independent contractors. "It can't cover a worker who doesn't have a boss," said State Senator Jessica Ramos, the sponsor of the bill, writing in a tweet the emergency bill is "far from perfect." "If you don't have an employer, then you don't have a person to pay your sick leave," she told Gothamist. "That's the big hurdle with freelancers and app workers." "That's the problem, because who's going to pay them paid sick leave if under the eyes of the law they are independent contractors?" she said. Ramos is not ready to discuss how to fill that gap for those workers. "Right now, the number one priority is getting the medical emergency in control," Ramos said. "We are addressing all of the issues that have risen out of the consequences of coronavirus as soon as we can." Co-founders of A Better Balance Sherry Leiwant and Dina Bakst said in a statement : "In this time of crisis, the new law will help New Yorkers to follow New York State’s and the CDC’s recommendations to protect their own health and the health of their loved ones, while also protecting the health of the public as a whole." A broader paid sick leave mandate is expected to pass as a part of the budget, according to Ramos. A draft of the bill that Cuomo's office released shows that sick leave would be between five and seven days a year for paid time-off, except for employers with four or fewer workers. New York City has had five days of mandated paid sick leave since 2014 . "By guaranteeing a permanent right to job-protected paid sick time, New York lawmakers also recognize that we need to protect the health and economic security of our working families beyond national emergencies," the co-founders added. "New York’s law should serve as a model for other states around the country seeking to ensure the health and safety of their citizens." As a part of broader efforts to mitigate financial impacts during the public health emergency, Cuomo and New York Attorney General Letitia James will also stop collecting state-owed medical and student debt through April 16th. After that, James's office will "reassess" for a "possible extension." Those who qualify for the debt collection suspension include patients who owe state hospitals and veterans' homes and students who owe the State University of New York.

Basement Apartments Safe for Everyone The BASE (Basement Apartments Safe for Everyone) campaign is a coalition of community organizations, advocates, tenants, homeowners, and community members who are organizing working-class neighborhoods and communities of color to increase the number of legally-recognized, affordable, and safe basement apartments, as well as other accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) in New York City. The BASE (Basement Apartments Safe for Everyone) campaign is a coalition of community organizations, advocates, tenants, homeowners, and community members who are organizing working-class neighborhoods and communities of color to increase the number of legally-recognized, affordable, and safe basement apartments, as well as other accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) in New York City.   New York City is still facing a deep affordability crisis. For many low- and moderate-income New Yorkers, including immigrants, communities of color, and essential workers, basement apartments are one of the few accessible housing options. However, most remain unregulated and unsafe. While the state’s new Basement and Cellar Pilot Program is a long overdue step, it excludes many of the neighborhoods most affected by housing insecurity and past storms like Hurricane Ida. Without citywide legalization, too many tenants remain unprotected and too many small homeowners are denied the opportunity to stabilize their housing. We need a comprehensive solution that reflects the urgency and scale of this crisis. : We believe every tenant and homeowner should have access to safe, legal basement housing—regardless of zip code. The BASE Coalition is pushing for a citywide approach that includes access to resources for small homeowners, legal protections for tenants, and meaningful planning driven by community needs. Basement apartments are already a core part of NYC’s housing fabric. They deserve the same support, investment, and recognition as any other form of affordable housing. Our work is rooted in equity, safety, and long-term housing stability for all New Yorkers. – – For more information about the BASE campaign, contact Matthew Sooknanan at: matthew@chhayacdc.org Main Office: 37-43 77th St, 2nd Floor, Jackson Heights, NY 11372 Contact: 718.478.3848; info@chhayacdc.org Richmond Hill Center: 121-18 Liberty Avenue, 2nd Floor, Richmond Hill, NY 11419 Contact: 718.374.3371; info@chhayacdc.org Donate Copyright 2022 by Chhaya Community Development Corporation.

Max Touhey A Brooklyn City Council member plans to introduce a pioneering bill that could fundamentally reshape how rents are set for small commercial spaces—and breath new life into struggling mom-and-pop shops. Over the last year, councilmember Stephen Levin and small business advocates have worked to craft legislation that would regulate rents for retail, manufacturing, and office spaces under a certain square footage. The system would essentially mimic how the city’s rent-regulated apartments are managed, with the creation of a commercial rent stabilization board that would set increases and “provide predictability” to small businesses, Levin says. “We think that this is a viable bill that’s actually pretty straightforward,” Levin says. “There would be no incentive for a landlord to sit on an empty storefront and it would allow small businesses to compete.” As local shops have struggled with soaring rents, red tape, and competition from online retailers, empty retail space in New York City has doubled over the last decade—climbing to 11.8 million square feet in 2017 from 5.6 million square feet in 2007, according to a September study by Comptroller Scott Stringer . The citywide rate of empty storefronts jumped by nearly 50 percent—from 4 to 5.8 percent—during that same period, the report shows. Julian Hill, an attorney with Take Root Justice , which offers legal services to small commercial businesses through a contract with the city’s Department of Small Business Services and helped Levin’s office develop the bill, frequently works with tenants who are faced with steep rent increases. Levin’s bill, Hill says, could be a key step toward stability for small commercial renters. “Folks are being exploited in different neighborhoods throughout the city, and so how do you create a mechanism that helps to curtail that risk?” says Hill. “I think a bill that approaches a way to stabilize rent is definitely something that will be valuable.” Retail and office space under 10,000 square feet and manufacturing space within 25,000 square feet would fall under the purview of the commercial rent guidelines board. That body would consider myriad factors while mulling increases, including the economic conditions of the real estate industry such as “commercial real estate taxes, sewer and water rates, gross operating and maintenance costs,” according to one section of the bill as currently drafted. The overall supply of commercial space and vacancy rates would also be considered. If a storefront is empty when the bill takes effect, according to Levin, then the first rent negotiated between the landlord and tenant would be the starting point for adjustments. “We’re not looking to take away anyone’s livelihoods,” Levin says. “The goal is to provide some stability so that business owners can make investments in their companies, and so landlords know what they’ll be getting and can plan accordingly instead of holding a storefront empty waiting for a windfall.” New York City previously had a commercial rent control statute from 1945 to 1963 , but after the law expired, regulation efforts largely faded from the policy landscape. Advocates pushing the long-stalled Small Business Jobs Survival Act , which would give tenants the right to a 10-year lease renewal and force landlords and tenants to go to arbitration if they cannot agree on an increase, saw a flicker of hope when the bill was resurrected for a City Council hearing in 2018, the first time in nine years. But Council speaker Corey Johnson has flagged concerns about the bill and Mayor Bill de Blasio does not back the legislation; SBJS has since seen little traction. Other, less aggressive, legislation geared toward better understanding the city’s retail vacancy crisis passed the Council in July, including the “Storefront Tracker” bill that will gather data on commercial vacancies and make it available via a digital tool. While helpful, those bills don’t go far enough and more dramatic measures are needed to ensure the mom-and-pop businesses and local commerce survive, says Olympia Kazi, an architect with the NYC Artist Coalition . “It’s about the culture of the city. Basically we’ve been bleeding culture out of the city,” says Kazi, who points to now closed businesses like the Cornelia Street Cafe, a mainstay in the city’s literary, music, and art world for 41 years that shuttered in January .

Max Touhey A Brooklyn City Council member plans to introduce a pioneering bill that could fundamentally reshape how rents are set for small commercial spaces—and breath new life into struggling mom-and-pop shops. Over the last year, councilmember Stephen Levin and small business advocates have worked to craft legislation that would regulate rents for retail, manufacturing, and office spaces under a certain square footage. The system would essentially mimic how the city’s rent-regulated apartments are managed, with the creation of a commercial rent stabilization board that would set increases and “provide predictability” to small businesses, Levin says. “We think that this is a viable bill that’s actually pretty straightforward,” Levin says. “There would be no incentive for a landlord to sit on an empty storefront and it would allow small businesses to compete.” As local shops have struggled with soaring rents, red tape, and competition from online retailers, empty retail space in New York City has doubled over the last decade—climbing to 11.8 million square feet in 2017 from 5.6 million square feet in 2007, according to a September study by Comptroller Scott Stringer . The citywide rate of empty storefronts jumped by nearly 50 percent—from 4 to 5.8 percent—during that same period, the report shows. Julian Hill, an attorney with Take Root Justice , which offers legal services to small commercial businesses through a contract with the city’s Department of Small Business Services and helped Levin’s office develop the bill, frequently works with tenants who are faced with steep rent increases. Levin’s bill, Hill says, could be a key step toward stability for small commercial renters. “Folks are being exploited in different neighborhoods throughout the city, and so how do you create a mechanism that helps to curtail that risk?” says Hill. “I think a bill that approaches a way to stabilize rent is definitely something that will be valuable.” Retail and office space under 10,000 square feet and manufacturing space within 25,000 square feet would fall under the purview of the commercial rent guidelines board. That body would consider myriad factors while mulling increases, including the economic conditions of the real estate industry such as “commercial real estate taxes, sewer and water rates, gross operating and maintenance costs,” according to one section of the bill as currently drafted. The overall supply of commercial space and vacancy rates would also be considered. If a storefront is empty when the bill takes effect, according to Levin, then the first rent negotiated between the landlord and tenant would be the starting point for adjustments. “We’re not looking to take away anyone’s livelihoods,” Levin says. “The goal is to provide some stability so that business owners can make investments in their companies, and so landlords know what they’ll be getting and can plan accordingly instead of holding a storefront empty waiting for a windfall.” New York City previously had a commercial rent control statute from 1945 to 1963 , but after the law expired, regulation efforts largely faded from the policy landscape. Advocates pushing the long-stalled Small Business Jobs Survival Act , which would give tenants the right to a 10-year lease renewal and force landlords and tenants to go to arbitration if they cannot agree on an increase, saw a flicker of hope when the bill was resurrected for a City Council hearing in 2018, the first time in nine years. But Council speaker Corey Johnson has flagged concerns about the bill and Mayor Bill de Blasio does not back the legislation; SBJS has since seen little traction. Other, less aggressive, legislation geared toward better understanding the city’s retail vacancy crisis passed the Council in July, including the “Storefront Tracker” bill that will gather data on commercial vacancies and make it available via a digital tool. While helpful, those bills don’t go far enough and more dramatic measures are needed to ensure the mom-and-pop businesses and local commerce survive, says Olympia Kazi, an architect with the NYC Artist Coalition . “It’s about the culture of the city. Basically we’ve been bleeding culture out of the city,” says Kazi, who points to now closed businesses like the Cornelia Street Cafe, a mainstay in the city’s literary, music, and art world for 41 years that shuttered in January . The restaurant’s rent and basement performance space was $33,000 per month, 77 times the rent paid when the business first opened. “It’s very important that people have access to culture in an affordable way,” says Kazi. “How unfair is it for these community spaces that have been operating for 10, 20, 30 years—building the neighborhood—and then suddenly have their rent spiked?
