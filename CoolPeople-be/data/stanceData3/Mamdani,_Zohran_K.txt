Assemblymember Zohran K. Mamdani Assembly District 36  Home About Biography District Map Biography District Map Newsroom Press Releases Publications News Articles Press Releases Publications News Articles Media Video Video Legislation Committee Membership Contact Assembly Home Contact Join email list Map & Offices Biography Zohran Kwame Mamdani was born and raised in Kampala, Uganda, moving to New York City with his family at the age of 7. A graduate of the NYC Public School System, he attended the Bronx High School of Science and received a Bachelor’s Degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College. A few years later in 2018, he became naturalized as an American citizen. Prior to representing the 36th Assembly District and its neighborhoods of Astoria, Ditmars-Steinway, and Astoria Heights, Zohran worked as a foreclosure prevention housing counselor, helping low-income homeowners of color across Queens fight off eviction and stay in their homes. It was this job that led him to run for office. After having spent every day negotiating with banks that valued profits over people, he came face-to-face with the reality that this housing crisis – one which predated this pandemic – was not natural to our lives, but instead a choice. A choice that was the consequence of decades of pro-corporate policies enacted across our country as well as our state. Yet, like with any choice, we always have the opportunity to change and Zohran is excited to be a part of that. More than his professional experience, however it was the act of organizing that led to Zohran becoming politically active in the first place. In high school, Zohran co-founded his school’s first ever cricket team, which would go on to participate in the Public School Athletic League’s inaugural cricket season. This act, though not ostensibly a political one, taught him how coming together with a few like-minded individuals can transform rhetoric into reality. Prior to that, his politics had been expressed primarily through long Facebook posts whose impact was the same as the Yankees’ rings from the last 10 years. Taking that lesson with him, he went on to co-found his college’s first Students for Justice in Palestine chapter and later organize across the country with different progressive organizations seeking to win national elections as well as expand healthcare coverage. As life took its inevitable turns, with detours in film, rap, and writing, it was always organizing that ensured that the events of our world would not lead him to despair, but to action. As an Assemblymember, Zohran fights every day for a future where each and every New Yorker lives a dignified life and where the distribution of that dignity is not determined by the market. At a time when almost a quarter of his neighbors across Astoria spend half their income on rent, when they breathe the most polluted air in Queens, and where they are profiled at the highest rates of any neighborhood in the borough, Zohran believes that the future we deserve is one where housing, energy, and justice are for the many, not just the few. Zohran is proud to be the first South Asian man to serve in the NYS Assembly as well as the first Ugandan and only the third Muslim to ever be a member of the body. For too long, communities such as these have been left out of our state’s politics and priorities. Zohran will seek to amplify the voices of the preferably unheard across both the district and the state for as long as he remains in office.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer Zohran Mamdani is running for Mayor to lower the cost of living for working class New Yorkers. Zohran Mamdani   This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. Meet Zohran Zohran Kwame Mamdani is a New York State Assemblymember and democratic socialist running for Mayor. Born in Uganda and raised in New York City, he has fought for the working class in and outside the legislature: hunger striking alongside taxi drivers to achieve more than $450 million in transformative debt relief, winning over $100 million in the state budget for increased subway service and a successful fare-free bus pilot, and organizing New Yorkers to defeat a proposed dirty power plant. The cost of living is crushing working people but Zohran believes that government can lower costs and make life easier in our city — he’ll use every tool available to bring down the rent, create world class public transit, and make it easier to raise a family. Join Zohran for NYC This campaign is about talking to thousands of New Yorkers across the city about how we make this city work better for the many and not the few. And to do this, we need you. Join an upcoming canvass (or two!) and learn how to have positive conversations with New Yorkers about freezing the rent, free and fast buses, universal childcare and more! No experience is required. All canvasses start with a training and you will be paired up with a partner if you are new to this. We can't wait to see you! Sign up to volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. Read Zohran’s platform on all of the issues New Yorkers are facing HERE .

He is the antithesis of politics for show. He has proven to be what many voters now think is impossible: an elected official for the people. Can Zohran Mamdani, a Socialist and TikTok Savant, Become N.Y.C. Mayor? In the crowded race for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani has become a magnet for attention, ascending in the polls and raising money through a mix of social media savvy and a plain-spoken, everyman approach. The Democrats Are Losing the Social Media Wars. This Young Socialist Is Changing That. As Democrats around the country debate moderation, doing nothing or pursuing a politics of abundance — calling for government to stop getting in the way of things like building housing with over-regulation — Mamdani is an example of another path, one that follows in the footsteps of Sanders by lifting up concrete leftist policies toward a social safety net and affordable cost of living. The Happiest Democrat in America A recent surge of glowing profiles and features have underlined the New York state assemblyman’s unlikely No. 2 position in polls for mayor, behind only Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who leads the race. They tend to point to his acumen online, especially on TikTok—this kind of video is a prime example—and his ambidextrous appeal to different voters despite his unapologetic democratic socialist politics. His fundraising, driven by small donors, has topped $8 million. He is the rare Democrat who is meeting the most stark and uncertain moment in the party’s recent history with a message that’s both urgent and, against all odds, upbeat. Mamdani maxes out fundraising for NYC mayoral primary, campaign says The democratic socialist, who is currently serving as a state assemblymember from Queens, said he plans to announce Monday that his campaign is the first in the New York City mayor's race to hit the fundraising cap. He said he has raised more than $8 million with projected matching funds from about 18,000 donors citywide and has done so at a faster rate than any campaign in city history. Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Will Run Against Mayor Adams Mr. Mamdani, who has called on Mr. Adams to resign, said in an interview that the mayor had failed New Yorkers. He said that he would focus his campaign on addressing the city’s affordability crisis. ‘Working-class New Yorkers are being pushed out of the city they built’: why Zohran Mamdani is running for mayor In 2021, Mamdani went on a 15-day hunger strike to protest predatory loans that targeted the taxi drivers who purchased “medallions”, the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. The city eventually caved and struck a deal with medallion loan guarantors, securing $450m in transformative debt relief for these drivers. Twenty Minutes With Queens State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Candidate to Unseat Mayor Eric Adams In the crowded 2025 mayoral primary race, Zohran Mamdani stands out. The 33-year-old Queens State Assemblymember was behind the City's first free bus pilot , introduced legislation that would bar charities from funding illegal Israeli settlements, and went on a hunger strike to secure debt relief for taxi drivers. Mamdani was born and raised in Uganda until he moved to New York at the age of seven, and would be the city's first Muslim mayor. N.Y.C. Grocery Prices Are High. Could City-Owned Stores Help?

But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

The cost of living is crushing working people but Zohran believes that government can lower costs and make life easier in our city — he’ll use every tool available to bring down the rent, create world class public transit, and make it easier to raise a family. Join Zohran for NYC This campaign is about talking to thousands of New Yorkers across the city about how we make this city work better for the many and not the few. And to do this, we need you. Join an upcoming canvass (or two!) and learn how to have positive conversations with New Yorkers about freezing the rent, free and fast buses, universal childcare and more! No experience is required. All canvasses start with a training and you will be paired up with a partner if you are new to this. We can't wait to see you! Sign up to volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. Read Zohran’s platform on all of the issues New Yorkers are facing HERE .

He is the antithesis of politics for show. He has proven to be what many voters now think is impossible: an elected official for the people. Can Zohran Mamdani, a Socialist and TikTok Savant, Become N.Y.C. Mayor? In the crowded race for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani has become a magnet for attention, ascending in the polls and raising money through a mix of social media savvy and a plain-spoken, everyman approach. The Democrats Are Losing the Social Media Wars. This Young Socialist Is Changing That. As Democrats around the country debate moderation, doing nothing or pursuing a politics of abundance — calling for government to stop getting in the way of things like building housing with over-regulation — Mamdani is an example of another path, one that follows in the footsteps of Sanders by lifting up concrete leftist policies toward a social safety net and affordable cost of living. The Happiest Democrat in America A recent surge of glowing profiles and features have underlined the New York state assemblyman’s unlikely No. 2 position in polls for mayor, behind only Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who leads the race. They tend to point to his acumen online, especially on TikTok—this kind of video is a prime example—and his ambidextrous appeal to different voters despite his unapologetic democratic socialist politics. His fundraising, driven by small donors, has topped $8 million. He is the rare Democrat who is meeting the most stark and uncertain moment in the party’s recent history with a message that’s both urgent and, against all odds, upbeat. Mamdani maxes out fundraising for NYC mayoral primary, campaign says The democratic socialist, who is currently serving as a state assemblymember from Queens, said he plans to announce Monday that his campaign is the first in the New York City mayor's race to hit the fundraising cap. He said he has raised more than $8 million with projected matching funds from about 18,000 donors citywide and has done so at a faster rate than any campaign in city history. Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Will Run Against Mayor Adams Mr. Mamdani, who has called on Mr. Adams to resign, said in an interview that the mayor had failed New Yorkers. He said that he would focus his campaign on addressing the city’s affordability crisis. ‘Working-class New Yorkers are being pushed out of the city they built’: why Zohran Mamdani is running for mayor In 2021, Mamdani went on a 15-day hunger strike to protest predatory loans that targeted the taxi drivers who purchased “medallions”, the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. The city eventually caved and struck a deal with medallion loan guarantors, securing $450m in transformative debt relief for these drivers. Twenty Minutes With Queens State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Candidate to Unseat Mayor Eric Adams In the crowded 2025 mayoral primary race, Zohran Mamdani stands out. The 33-year-old Queens State Assemblymember was behind the City's first free bus pilot , introduced legislation that would bar charities from funding illegal Israeli settlements, and went on a hunger strike to secure debt relief for taxi drivers. Mamdani was born and raised in Uganda until he moved to New York at the age of seven, and would be the city's first Muslim mayor. N.Y.C. Grocery Prices Are High. Could City-Owned Stores Help? A New York City mayoral candidate wants the city to open its own, more affordable grocery stores. The idea has gained momentum in Chicago and other cities.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer Zohran for NYC / Policy Protecting New York's Tenants Rebuilding the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants New York City is a majority-tenant town, yet our city government regularly lets negligent and dishonest landlords off the hook. As Mayor, Zohran Mamdani will take back our power and protect New York’s renters through the Office to Protect Tenants. Introduction Thousands of New York City residents live in inadequate or unsafe housing — their maintenance needs repeatedly ignored by negligent landlords. One in 10 rental units reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. These are hard-working New Yorkers who deserve a safe roof over their heads. The City is supposed to issue violations and fine landlords who fail to make repairs, but in reality our code enforcement system is broken. Tenants are forced to jump through hoops just to get violations recorded, and the City responds to slum conditions with miniscule fines—if any at all. Less than half of housing violations ever get fixed, and code enforcement officers come unpredictably and after long delays. As Mayor, Zohran will stand up for New York’s tenants and ensure they live in safe and habitable homes. Zohran will rebuild the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants —a longstanding tool of City Hall that has been defunded and deprioritized under Mayor Adams. Its mission under Zohran? To streamline bureaucratic boondoggles and actually enforce tenants’ rights by implementing existing housing laws to their fullest extent. The Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants Will: Streamline Housing Code Enforcement Right now, at least five agencies (HPD, DOB, FDNY, DEP, DOH) are responsible for housing maintenance issues. Under Zohran’s administration, the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants will coordinate code enforcement under one roof—from the inspectors who come to our apartments to the lawyers who litigate in Housing Court—enabling the City’s ability to resolve issues quickly. Fix 311 and Allow Tenants to Schedule Inspections and Track Complaint Status Right now, when a tenant reports a code violation to 311, they get routed to one of many different agencies and, in most cases, have no ability to track when inspectors are coming. We will enable tenants to schedule an appointment with an inspector and receive reminders over text. We will also create one website —a centralized and user-friendly portal—where tenants and inspectors can track all violations and fines owed in a building. Increase Fines for Dangerous Living Conditions The problems tenants deal with every day need to become real problems for landlords, too. We will double the fines for hazardous violations (cracks in the walls, broken windows, water damage, roaches, and defective locks) and triple fines for immediately hazardous violations (vermin, heat and hot water, lead paint). Most importantly, we will ensure fines are actually collected, which will bring at least $800M immediately owed back to the city and generate hundreds of millions more each year. Force Landlords to Take Extreme Heat Seriously New Yorkers are at risk of extreme heat as our planet warms. We will update the Housing Maintenance Code to meet the needs of the city in 2025 and make it a Class C violation to fail to provide adequately cool apartments during the summer months. We will require building owners to maintain a maximum indoor temperature of 78°F when the outdoor temperature is 82°F or higher. We will also install heat sensors in buildings with repeated heat violations. Expand the Scope, Funding, and Staffing of City’s Enforcement Programs Zohran’s administration will hire more public servants to do the critical work of enforcing the housing maintenance code, building code, fire code, and environmental standards, health standards, and more. This means more dedicated inspectors, lawyers, data analysts, tenant helpline staffers, and outreach specialists. Crack Down on Repeat-Offending Landlords Zohran will double the size of the Alternative Enforcement Program and expand the Office of Special Enforcement, so repeat offenders are finally held accountable through higher fines. He will also restore funding to the Anti-Harassment Tenant Protection program which supports at-risk tenants in bringing affirmative cases against their negligent landlords without risk of abuse. Under Mayor Adams, $25 million has been cut from this program over the last three years. Guarantee Repairs If tenants are still facing issues after repeated complaints, the City will ensure the buck stops with them. Under current but underutilized law, the City has the power to complete repairs and bill the landlord. Zohran will use the law when necessary, so no tenant lives in unsafe, poor-quality housing. A Zero-Tolerance Policy Towards Bad Landlords When a restaurant serves unsafe food, the Health Department shuts it down. Yet too many bad landlords are allowed to stay in business, ripping off tenants and placing them in unsafe conditions. Under Zohran’s administration, landlords who do not work with the Office to Protect Tenants and repeatedly put New Yorkers at risk will not be allowed to operate in New York City — with no exceptions. We’ll prioritize the preservation of distressed rental housing by publicly stewarding buildings in disrepair . Working with tenants on a case-by-case basis, we will determine the best management solution of the buildings while retaining public ownership of the land. For over 30 years, the City has successfully pursued public stewardship of distressed buildings and built thousands of units of deeply affordable housing—but the practice stopped in recent years. Under Neighborhood Pillars —a program created by Mayor de Blasio in 2018—the City can work with tenants’ associations and community partners to finance the purchase and renovation of poor quality housing. The program’s funding was fully cut under Mayor Adams, however, until the New York City Council secured a $1 billion commitment to the program in 2024. We will fully fund Neighborhood Pillars at the level secured by City Council and unlock the City’s full power to improve our neighborhoods and the health of our communities. This could mean the preservation of at least 20,000 homes over the next 10 years. How Does the City Do This? Identify non-compliant or at-risk buildings through the Office of Tenant Protection With the owner and with the tenants, pursue a pathway to preservation: Litigation: the City forces the owner to sell the building or a portfolio of buildings through a public foreclosure process Acquisition: the City purchases a building or a portfolio of buildings from the owner for a negotiated price Financing: the City acquires the mortgage-debt of a distressed building and either forecloses on the property or refinances Each of these pathways will bring the building into public stewardship through public financing with existing HPD preservation loan programs / Protecting New York's Tenants Rebuilding the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants New York City is a majority-tenant town, yet our city government regularly lets negligent and dishonest landlords off the hook.

The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more.

Mamdani of Queens. File Photo by Paul Frangipane Con Edison customers across New York City might soon have to dig even deeper to pay for their electricity — a prospect that has left plenty of local lawmakers charged. On Feb. 28, Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani joined six other state legislators to urge Governor Kathy Hochul to rule against utility provider Con Edison’s proposal to increase rates for gas and electricity for New York utility customers. What this means for New Yorkers is an increase of $20.90 every month for electricity and $37.88 every month for gas, which translates to around a yearly increase of $705. This is part of a three-year rate increase plan agreed upon Feb. 16 between Con Edison and the Public Service Commission, the state’s arm that oversees gas, electricity, and water industries. For the next three years, Con Edison will rake in an additional $457.45 million every year in electric delivery service revenue for a total of $1.37 billion, and an additional $187.2 million every year in gas revenue for a total of $561.6 million, according to the joint proposal between Con Edison and the PSC. Close Get amNY in your inbox! News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up The company says the revenue would help finance a $1.2 billion upgrade to its electric delivery system, a $500 million upgrade to its gas system, $1.1 billion storm infrastructure improvements, as well as funding for the company’s renewable energy plans, including using clean hydrogen and replacing gas mains to prevent leaks and methane emissions. The additional funding from these rate hikes are critical to meet Con Edison’s goals, according to Con Edison spokesperson Jamie McShane. “This investment from customers will steer New York away from fossil fuels, promote the use of electric heat pumps, energy-efficient appliances, electric vehicle chargers, battery storage and more,” McShane said. “These programs are designed to increase benefits for disadvantaged communities, ensuring all our customers can reap immediate and lasting benefits from New York’s historic shift to clean energy.” But Mamdani says the rate increase goes against the complaints from his constituents and millions of other Con Ed customers who don’t want to see their monthly energy bills skyrocket. “We’ve heard from the more than a million New Yorkers that we represent that they are being forced into impossible choices,” Mamdani told amNewYork Metro. “I’ve already heard from so many seniors in my own district who are on fixed incomes, about how they’re trying to ration out their medication so that they can pay for their ConEd bill.” Mamdani issued the joint Feb. 28 statement along with colleagues state Senators Julia Salazar (SD-18), Jabari Brisport (SD-25), and Kristen Gonzalez (SD-59); and Assembly Members Emily Gallagher (AD-50), Marcela Mitaynes (AD-51), and Phara Souffrant Forrest (AD-57). While there are certain charges on utility bills that are outside of Con Edison’s control — including a rise in oil and gas prices, increased demand, global supply chain issues, and the Russia-Ukraine War — Mamdani said the proposed rate hikes are especially egregious because the additional $60 monthly charge doesn’t fall under those categories. “This additional charge is completely within ConEd’s control,” Mamdani said. “More so than ConEd, it is actually within the control of New York state government. This proposal that the state has initially signed off on is a slap in the face.” State of New York Public Service Commission. Screenshot by Sarah Belle Lin. Governor Hochul announced on Feb. 28 the continuance of an energy relief plan through the Home Energy Assistance Program. The HEAP Program is supposed to to bring $672 million for 478,000 households and 56,000 small businesses, as well as $200 million for 800,000 customers with salaries under $75,000 who are ineligible for the state’s existing utility discount program. Mamdani called the state’s financial support a “Band-Aid on a wound that continues to fester.” “It is a substantial contribution and does assist a number of New Yorkers, but it is only a fraction of what the larger debt is in New York state,” Mamdani said. “Fundamentally, there is not enough relief that can make up for a pricing structure that people simply cannot keep up with.” Before the pandemic, residential utility arrears, or unpaid balances, behind by more than 60 days totaled $677 million. This increased to $1.7 billion by April 2022. For non-residential customers, arrears increased by 453% in that same period, according to Aric Rider, the deputy director of the Office of Consumer Services. The PSC recently held a meeting on energy affordability on Jan. 19. The commission provided an update on the first phase of the state’s Energy Affordability Program: $502 million has been provided to roughly 850,000 customers to help with their utility bills, according to Aric Rider, the deputy director of the Office of Consumer Services. $672 million is proposed for the program’s second phase. Con Edison also recently launched a campaign to suggest practical ways to conserve energy costs, including signing up for different payment plans. Last September, dozens of legislators, led by Mamdani and Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris called on Con Edison to hold another public hearing hearing before rates increased. The last public hearing Con Edison held on the rate case was last March. Mamdani said he hasn’t heard of any plans for another public hearing before rate hikes will go into effect on June 1. Environmental advocacy groups including the Public Utility Law Project, Sane Energy Project, and Alliance for a Green Economy, have called for a transition to a publicly-owned energy system that relies on renewable sources. Mamdani said he has also been “advocating externally for a Con Edison rate reduction.” “We would appreciate any and all rate reductions,” Mamdani said. “It has to be less than what it is now.” Read more : NYPD’s Tania Kinsella Highlights Crime Reduction About the Author Sarah Belle Lin Sarah Belle Lin covers education and general assignments for amNewYork Metro.

This is part of a three-year rate increase plan agreed upon Feb. 16 between Con Edison and the Public Service Commission, the state’s arm that oversees gas, electricity, and water industries. For the next three years, Con Edison will rake in an additional $457.45 million every year in electric delivery service revenue for a total of $1.37 billion, and an additional $187.2 million every year in gas revenue for a total of $561.6 million, according to the joint proposal between Con Edison and the PSC. Close Get amNY in your inbox! Sign Up The company says the revenue would help finance a $1.2 billion upgrade to its electric delivery system, a $500 million upgrade to its gas system, $1.1 billion storm infrastructure improvements, as well as funding for the company’s renewable energy plans, including using clean hydrogen and replacing gas mains to prevent leaks and methane emissions. The additional funding from these rate hikes are critical to meet Con Edison’s goals, according to Con Edison spokesperson Jamie McShane. “This investment from customers will steer New York away from fossil fuels, promote the use of electric heat pumps, energy-efficient appliances, electric vehicle chargers, battery storage and more,” McShane said. “These programs are designed to increase benefits for disadvantaged communities, ensuring all our customers can reap immediate and lasting benefits from New York’s historic shift to clean energy.” But Mamdani says the rate increase goes against the complaints from his constituents and millions of other Con Ed customers who don’t want to see their monthly energy bills skyrocket. “We’ve heard from the more than a million New Yorkers that we represent that they are being forced into impossible choices,” Mamdani told amNewYork Metro. “I’ve already heard from so many seniors in my own district who are on fixed incomes, about how they’re trying to ration out their medication so that they can pay for their ConEd bill.” Mamdani issued the joint Feb. 28 statement along with colleagues state Senators Julia Salazar (SD-18), Jabari Brisport (SD-25), and Kristen Gonzalez (SD-59); and Assembly Members Emily Gallagher (AD-50), Marcela Mitaynes (AD-51), and Phara Souffrant Forrest (AD-57). While there are certain charges on utility bills that are outside of Con Edison’s control — including a rise in oil and gas prices, increased demand, global supply chain issues, and the Russia-Ukraine War — Mamdani said the proposed rate hikes are especially egregious because the additional $60 monthly charge doesn’t fall under those categories. “This additional charge is completely within ConEd’s control,” Mamdani said. “More so than ConEd, it is actually within the control of New York state government. This proposal that the state has initially signed off on is a slap in the face.” State of New York Public Service Commission. Screenshot by Sarah Belle Lin. Governor Hochul announced on Feb. 28 the continuance of an energy relief plan through the Home Energy Assistance Program. The HEAP Program is supposed to to bring $672 million for 478,000 households and 56,000 small businesses, as well as $200 million for 800,000 customers with salaries under $75,000 who are ineligible for the state’s existing utility discount program. Mamdani called the state’s financial support a “Band-Aid on a wound that continues to fester.” “It is a substantial contribution and does assist a number of New Yorkers, but it is only a fraction of what the larger debt is in New York state,” Mamdani said. “Fundamentally, there is not enough relief that can make up for a pricing structure that people simply cannot keep up with.” Before the pandemic, residential utility arrears, or unpaid balances, behind by more than 60 days totaled $677 million. This increased to $1.7 billion by April 2022. For non-residential customers, arrears increased by 453% in that same period, according to Aric Rider, the deputy director of the Office of Consumer Services. The PSC recently held a meeting on energy affordability on Jan. 19. The commission provided an update on the first phase of the state’s Energy Affordability Program: $502 million has been provided to roughly 850,000 customers to help with their utility bills, according to Aric Rider, the deputy director of the Office of Consumer Services. $672 million is proposed for the program’s second phase. Con Edison also recently launched a campaign to suggest practical ways to conserve energy costs, including signing up for different payment plans. Last September, dozens of legislators, led by Mamdani and Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris called on Con Edison to hold another public hearing hearing before rates increased. The last public hearing Con Edison held on the rate case was last March. Mamdani said he hasn’t heard of any plans for another public hearing before rate hikes will go into effect on June 1. Environmental advocacy groups including the Public Utility Law Project, Sane Energy Project, and Alliance for a Green Economy, have called for a transition to a publicly-owned energy system that relies on renewable sources.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

He contends that the city needs to be a leader and set a minimum wage that better meets New Yorkers’ needs as the cost of living explodes, straining wallets and driving many from their homes and the city itself. The ambitious plan, shared exclusively with City & State ahead of its Thursday release, would involve Mamdani working with the New York City Council to pass a new minimum wage law, incrementally raising the city’s minimum wage – which is currently set at $16.50 – to $30. While the state Legislature has long been the sole governing body in New York setting the general minimum wage for workers in the city, Mamdani and his team contend there are legitimate routes that would give the City Council this authority. “When working people have more money in their pocket, the overall economy thrives,”  Mamdani said in an interview. “Right now if you are earning a minimum wage in the city, you simply cannot afford to continue calling it your home. We have to change that.” Under Mamdani’s proposal, the city’s minimum wage would increase to $20 per hour in 2027, $23.50 in 2028, $27 in 2029 and $30 in 2030. Starting Jan. 1, 2031, it would automatically increase every year based on either cost of living increases or productivity increases – whichever was higher at the time. Both of those metrics are tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In regards to smaller businesses, which per state law pertains to companies with 11 or more employees, the minimum wage would be phased in over a longer period of time. The idea, however, would be to ultimately get that number to $30. As the city faces a once-in-a generation affordability crisis that’s left around half of city households struggling to pay for their basic needs, impacts have been sweeping. A recent survey of 3,000 New Yorkers released by the 5BORO Institute Thursday morning found that 48% of New Yorkers are considering leaving the city in large part because of financial pressures – 61% of whom said they are struggling to pay for their basic needs. In many ways, New York has been a leader in the fight for wage increases – particularly when compared with the federal minimum wage, which has remained stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyʼs Living Wage Calculator , a living wage for a single person with no children in New York City is currently about $30. In 2016, New York became one of the first states to adopt a $15 an hour wage. And in 2023, Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Legislature struck an agreement to index the minimum wage to inflation, raising it to $16.50 in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County as of January 2025. While Mamdani acknowledged this was a step in the right direction, he believes the city needs to go even farther. Affordability has emerged as a major topic in politics over the last year, with incumbent politicians – including New York City Mayor Eric Adams – and their various challengers scrambling to position themselves as “the affordability candidate.” Much of Mamdani’s campaign has centered on lowering costs for working-class New Yorkers. While some ideas are more feasible than others, he’s previously committed to freeze rents for rent-stabilized apartments, proposed eliminating bus fares, universal child care, building 200,000 new “affordable” homes over the next decade, and to open city-owned grocery stores to bring down food costs. It’s unclear whether the City Council currently has the authority to carry out this latest proposal as historically, the state Legislature has set the minimum wage across the state. Mamdani and his team believe it is possible. The Tompkins County Legislature is currently exploring whether it has the authority to implement a higher minimum wage. Over the summer, the body passed a resolution that asks the state to allow counties seeking to raise the minimum wage beyond the state standard to do so through something in the state’s constitution called the “home rule” principle, which grants local governments the power to make and amend laws within their own jurisdictions. A spokesperson for Mamdani pointed to that principle as one way his policy would be possible. If the city encountered any legal obstacles, their administration would work with the state Legislature to clarify the city’s authority – potentially through a piece of legislation of which Mamdani is currently a co-sponsor that would explicitly grant local governments the power to implement a higher level of the minimum wage. Some other municipalities and cities outside of the state currently have this power. As for the City Council’s willingness to enact such a change, Mamdani is confident. City & State didn’t reach out to City Council members to gauge interest per the campaign’s conditions of this exclusive report ahead of its official announcement. “There’s a lot of interest amongst the existing City Council on taking steps towards making the city more affordable,” Mamdani said. “What they’ve shown time and time again, is they’re willing to take those steps, but they’ve been stymied by a mayoral administration that has shown itself, at best, not interested, and at worst, taking every opportunity to exacerbate this cost of living crisis.” Some of the most common arguments against prior pushes to bolster the minimum wage include concerns that doing so would lead to businesses hiring fewer workers and adjusting their prices in light of increased labor costs, thus higher inflation. But other municipalities have already moved to increase their minimum wages to degrees far outstripping where things are currently at within the city. For example, Boulder County, Colorado is on track to reach a $25 minimum wage by 2030. Los Angeles recently passed a new law raising the minimum wage for its tourism workers to $30 per hour in 2028. “Too often we are told that fighting for workers is unrealistic, that fighting for workers is a policy that is too ambitious to actually bring to reality,” Mamdani said. “Yet we know this is the bare minimum that New Yorkers deserve at this moment.” Share This: NEXT STORY: Amid reelection battle, Shahana Hanif lands a heated rezoning deal Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one Albany Agenda The ambitious plan to Make Albany Great Again News & Politics Inside the quiet race for New York City's second-most powerful position Campaigns & Elections Here’s who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 Campaigns & Elections New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch News & Politics Meet the 2025 class of new state lawmakers sponsor content The road to economic prosperity is a bumpy one 2025 New York City Mayoral Election Mamdani unveils ‘$30 by ‘30’ minimum wage push as part of mayoral campaign The Assembly member and mayoral candidate is adding another plank to his affordability platform.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer Zohran Mamdani is running for Mayor to lower the cost of living for working class New Yorkers. Zohran Mamdani   This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. Meet Zohran Zohran Kwame Mamdani is a New York State Assemblymember and democratic socialist running for Mayor. Born in Uganda and raised in New York City, he has fought for the working class in and outside the legislature: hunger striking alongside taxi drivers to achieve more than $450 million in transformative debt relief, winning over $100 million in the state budget for increased subway service and a successful fare-free bus pilot, and organizing New Yorkers to defeat a proposed dirty power plant. The cost of living is crushing working people but Zohran believes that government can lower costs and make life easier in our city — he’ll use every tool available to bring down the rent, create world class public transit, and make it easier to raise a family. Join Zohran for NYC This campaign is about talking to thousands of New Yorkers across the city about how we make this city work better for the many and not the few. And to do this, we need you. Join an upcoming canvass (or two!) and learn how to have positive conversations with New Yorkers about freezing the rent, free and fast buses, universal childcare and more! No experience is required. All canvasses start with a training and you will be paired up with a partner if you are new to this. We can't wait to see you! Sign up to volunteer New York is too expensive.

Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. Read Zohran’s platform on all of the issues New Yorkers are facing HERE .

He is the antithesis of politics for show. He has proven to be what many voters now think is impossible: an elected official for the people. Can Zohran Mamdani, a Socialist and TikTok Savant, Become N.Y.C. Mayor? In the crowded race for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani has become a magnet for attention, ascending in the polls and raising money through a mix of social media savvy and a plain-spoken, everyman approach. The Democrats Are Losing the Social Media Wars. This Young Socialist Is Changing That. As Democrats around the country debate moderation, doing nothing or pursuing a politics of abundance — calling for government to stop getting in the way of things like building housing with over-regulation — Mamdani is an example of another path, one that follows in the footsteps of Sanders by lifting up concrete leftist policies toward a social safety net and affordable cost of living. The Happiest Democrat in America A recent surge of glowing profiles and features have underlined the New York state assemblyman’s unlikely No. 2 position in polls for mayor, behind only Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who leads the race. They tend to point to his acumen online, especially on TikTok—this kind of video is a prime example—and his ambidextrous appeal to different voters despite his unapologetic democratic socialist politics. His fundraising, driven by small donors, has topped $8 million. He is the rare Democrat who is meeting the most stark and uncertain moment in the party’s recent history with a message that’s both urgent and, against all odds, upbeat. Mamdani maxes out fundraising for NYC mayoral primary, campaign says The democratic socialist, who is currently serving as a state assemblymember from Queens, said he plans to announce Monday that his campaign is the first in the New York City mayor's race to hit the fundraising cap. He said he has raised more than $8 million with projected matching funds from about 18,000 donors citywide and has done so at a faster rate than any campaign in city history. Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Will Run Against Mayor Adams Mr. Mamdani, who has called on Mr. Adams to resign, said in an interview that the mayor had failed New Yorkers. He said that he would focus his campaign on addressing the city’s affordability crisis. ‘Working-class New Yorkers are being pushed out of the city they built’: why Zohran Mamdani is running for mayor In 2021, Mamdani went on a 15-day hunger strike to protest predatory loans that targeted the taxi drivers who purchased “medallions”, the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. The city eventually caved and struck a deal with medallion loan guarantors, securing $450m in transformative debt relief for these drivers. Twenty Minutes With Queens State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Candidate to Unseat Mayor Eric Adams In the crowded 2025 mayoral primary race, Zohran Mamdani stands out. The 33-year-old Queens State Assemblymember was behind the City's first free bus pilot , introduced legislation that would bar charities from funding illegal Israeli settlements, and went on a hunger strike to secure debt relief for taxi drivers. Mamdani was born and raised in Uganda until he moved to New York at the age of seven, and would be the city's first Muslim mayor. N.Y.C. Grocery Prices Are High. Could City-Owned Stores Help? A New York City mayoral candidate wants the city to open its own, more affordable grocery stores. The idea has gained momentum in Chicago and other cities.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare.

The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer Zohran for NYC / Policy Housing By and For New York February	3, 2025 New York City is a majority-tenant town, but too often, our government works for the landlords. It’s time to take back our power and unleash the public sector to build housing for the many. Introduction Last summer, for the first time in 15 years, New Yorkers were allowed to apply for a lottery to get help paying their rent. The lottery was open for just one week. More than 630,000 people applied to get on the waitlist for a program that currently approves only about 250 people a month . New York City now has the highest level of homelessness since the Great Depression. More than half of all households are rent-burdened. We need significantly more affordable housing. But for decades, the City has relied almost entirely on changes to the zoning code to invite and shape private development, with results that can fall short of the promises . And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for working families who need it the most. We can’t afford to wait for the private sector to solve this crisis. Zohran will triple the City’s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes, constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: projects like the 200 deeply affordable units at West 108th Street , the 175 affordable units above the new Inwood library , and the 500 affordable units on the site of the long-vacant Greenpoint Hospital will no longer take years to get approved. We’ll also double the money we’re spending to preserve public housing, and fully fund and staff our city’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. Investing in Public Sector Development From the first public housing in the nation to the union-built, publicly-funded, limited equity cooperatives that have kept hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers affordably housed, New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production. But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit. As Mayor, Zohran Mamdani will triple the City’s production of publicly-subsidized, affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes—creating 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. And he will double the amount of capital we are investing into preserving the homes of existing public housing tenants. This $100 billion dollar commitment over 10 years will once again make New York City a leader in providing homes for families who earn less than $70,000 a year—the median income for renters in New York—and ensure that our City’s resources are used to provide jobs with safety and dignity. Specifically, Zohran will: Triple the amount of housing built with City capital funds. A Mamdani administration will construct 200,000 new affordable homes over 10 years for low-income households, seniors, and working families. By putting the public sector in the driver’s seat, we’ll be able to increase the share of new units built that are affordable to families who are low-income or are stuck in our City’s shelter system. We’ll significantly expand programs that serve families with the greatest need: HPD’s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments (SARA), which produces 100% affordable low-income housing for seniors. HPD’s Extremely Low and Low-Income Affordability (ELLA), which produces 100% affordable housing for families who earn less than $72,000 for a family of four HRA’s Master Lease Program, which allows the City to pool its rental assistance programs (like CityFHEPS) to create project-based, subsidized housing for families at risk of eviction and/or living in the shelter program. This will go even further, as Zohran will drop lawsuits against CityFHEPs and ensure expansion proceeds as scheduled and per City Law. Recommit to public housing. Federal, state, and city disinvestment have left NYCHA tenants with crumbling buildings and uncertain futures. Zohran will double the City’s capital investment in major renovations of NYCHA housing, activate underutilized storage areas like parking lots for affordable housing development, and use tools like City subsidies to invest money directly in upgrading our public housing. Some of the City capital for new construction will be used to build new affordable, publicly-controlled housing on NYCHA’s City-owned land. Zohran will also push Albany to make a similar commitment to NYCHA’s capital needs on an annual basis. Invest in our public sector workforce. Zohran will fully fund and staff the operating budgets of the City’s housing agencies—including Housing Preservation & Development (HPD), the Department of City Planning (DCP), and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)—which have been woefully neglected under Mayor Adams. Zohran will increase staffing levels for financial closing and project management in construction and renovation pipelines to move projects forward more quickly. By increasing the number of people who work at HPD, DCP, and especially NYCHA, we’ll increase the City’s ability to ensure housing gets preserved and built. Fast-track planning review. Any project that commits to the administration’s affordability, stabilization, union labor, and sustainability goals will be expedited through land use review. Redirect the Office of Management and Budget towards public sector priorities, and advocate in Albany to increase the City’s public debt ceiling and in Washington to remove the City’s volume cap for affordable housing bond financing . Under the Adams administration, the Office of Management and Budget has acted as a barrier to creating more robust public services . Zohran will break that bottleneck by directing OMB to ensure that our resources are managed responsibly without hamstringing city services , including the development pipeline for affordable housing. Cities across the United States are passing sensible policies to expand municipal or state bonding capacity for affordable housing, using the public sector to build. But New York’s ability to issue municipal debt to fund public services is limited by arbitrary caps. Zohran will advocate in Albany and Washington to reform these archaic measures so we can invest deeply in affordable housing. We will fund this through: Municipal bonds – Zohran will allocate $70 billion new capital dollars in the City’s Ten-Year Capital Plan to create new affordable housing, raised on the municipal bond market. This is on top of the about $30 billion the City is already planning to spend, making our total investment $100 billion Activation of City-owned land and buildings - using the City’s public land as a source of subsidy, with numerous opportunities to build Pooled rental assistance - From a lack of available affordable supply to widespread source of income discrimination, the City’s voucher utilization rates are tremendously low— just 53% in 2022 for Section 8 and 21% for CityFHEPS from 2019 to 2023 . We can use this existing subsidy more efficiently by pooling individual rental assistance and providing project-based operating assistance to buildings that can then reliably use these stable income streams while providing very low rent. Comprehensive Planning Even with a $100 billion commitment to new publicly-subsidized and preserved housing, we must do much more. Zohran will give the public a firmer hand in guiding housing development across New York by pursuing a Comprehensive City plan. New York City, with more than eight million residents, does not have a guiding plan driving its growth and development. It’s high time we reformed our disjointed planning and zoning processes to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. Comprehensive, citywide planning will allow NYC both to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning and to proactively plan for the health and needs of the city—in housing, transit, education, and other areas. That planning will include: Increasing zoned capacity . This will allow housing supply to meet New York’s demand for both mixed-income and permanently affordable housing in areas that have historically not contributed to citywide housing goals—including those cut out of City of Yes. Supporting climate sustainability and accessibility. By encouraging growth around subway stations and other public transit hubs across New York City, we will create a greener city. Eliminating parking minimums . The City should be building housing, not parking lots. Advocating to expand rent stabilization in Albany. When the City allows private developers to build, we are inviting the private sector to profit. We should ensure New Yorkers are getting more in return than what is currently required through Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and programs like 485-x. Zohran will advocate in Albany to expand rent stabilization to all new production as it was under 421a—ensuring that any new housing built in our city provides a stable home for those who live there. / Housing By and For New York New York City is a majority-tenant town, but too often, our government works for the landlords. It’s time to take back our power and unleash the public sector to build housing for the many. Introduction Last summer, for the first time in 15 years, New Yorkers were allowed to apply for a lottery to get help paying their rent. The lottery was open for just one week. More than 630,000 people applied to get on the waitlist for a program that currently approves only about 250 people a month . New York City now has the highest level of homelessness since the Great Depression. More than half of all households are rent-burdened. We need significantly more affordable housing. But for decades, the City has relied almost entirely on changes to the zoning code to invite and shape private development, with results that can fall short of the promises . And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for working families who need it the most. We can’t afford to wait for the private sector to solve this crisis. Zohran will triple the City’s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes, constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: projects like the 200 deeply affordable units at West 108th Street , the 175 affordable units above the new Inwood library , and the 500 affordable units on the site of the long-vacant Greenpoint Hospital will no longer take years to get approved. We’ll also double the money we’re spending to preserve public housing, and fully fund and staff our city’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. Investing in Public Sector Development From the first public housing in the nation to the union-built, publicly-funded, limited equity cooperatives that have kept hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers affordably housed, New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production. But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit. As Mayor, Zohran Mamdani will triple the City’s production of publicly-subsidized, affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes—creating 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. And he will double the amount of capital we are investing into preserving the homes of existing public housing tenants. This $100 billion dollar commitment over 10 years will once again make New York City a leader in providing homes for families who earn less than $70,000 a year—the median income for renters in New York—and ensure that our City’s resources are used to provide jobs with safety and dignity. Specifically, Zohran will: Triple the amount of housing built with City capital funds. A Mamdani administration will construct 200,000 new affordable homes over 10 years for low-income households, seniors, and working families. By putting the public sector in the driver’s seat, we’ll be able to increase the share of new units built that are affordable to families who are low-income or are stuck in our City’s shelter system. We’ll significantly expand programs that serve families with the greatest need: HPD’s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments (SARA), which produces 100% affordable low-income housing for seniors. HPD’s Extremely Low and Low-Income Affordability (ELLA), which produces 100% affordable housing for families who earn less than $72,000 for a family of four HRA’s Master Lease Program, which allows the City to pool its rental assistance programs (like CityFHEPS) to create project-based, subsidized housing for families at risk of eviction and/or living in the shelter program. This will go even further, as Zohran will drop lawsuits against CityFHEPs and ensure expansion proceeds as scheduled and per City Law.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives.

Photos that look the way it felt Kara McCurdy New York City + Beyond inquire now kind of love. can't eat can't sleep, reach for the stars, over the fence world series That Hey friend welcome I'm Kara I’m an nyc-based documentary wedding + elopement photographer with a focus on intentionality. If you've ever felt like the big traditional weddings just are not for you, if you're dreading the idea of your wedding turning into a photo shoot, or if you simply want to marry the love of your life without the pressures of the wedding industry... you're in good company. Connect with Me but enough about me, you probably want to see some photos, huh? but enough about me, you probably want to see some photos, huh? but enough about me, you probably want to see some photos, huh? lifestyle elopements weddings Featured in the whole "big traditional wedding" thing just doesn't feel right you're less interested in a big production than you are in creating memories that you'll hold onto forever you want a wedding day that celebrates your unique love story- not some cookie cutter romance you're ecstatic for your wedding day to be here, but the thought of getting in front of a camera makes you break out in hives ...you wouldn't be the first to feel that way. Let me guess... We absolutely love Kara! We used her for our engagement, city hall ceremony, and our wedding in Savannah, GA. She is absolutely wonderful. We were so anxious to do our engagement pictures, but she immediately made us feel comfortable and calm. We knew we had to have her for the rest of our wedding. She is so creative and endlessly talented. We are so lucky to have gotten to work with her throughout our engagement/wedding. She also is great at advocating for what YOU want for your day, she helped with the timeline, she answered any question we had, and she also literally stitched my dress up 10 minutes before I was supposed to walk down the aisle - she can do it all haha. We have zero regrets in hiring her. She is the best. Caitlin + Eric xoxo Kara is an artist. Not only is she punctual and professional, but her product is a complete masterpiece. She has this way of making even the awkwardest of couples feel comfy and at home, and really lets their love lead in photos. She provided just enough creative direction to get us used to hearing the snap of the camera, but hit the perfect balance to make sure our photos were authentic and genuine to our relationship, without appearing overly posed. She was so enthusiastic with the most positive and radiant energy, and was so happy to join us on an adventure full of antics that we felt memorialized our relationship beautifully. Her editing style is beautiful, producing polished photos that still have some real level of rawness to them. Kara is AMAZING, 10000/10 recommend. Martina + Sean xoxo Where can we even start with Kara…. We are obsessed. We first booked her for our engagement photoshoot, and the moment we returned home from our shoot, we reached out to her and booked her for our wedding because we couldn’t imagine our day with anyone else. Throughout our entire wedding experience, Kara made us feel so comfortable and natural. She goes above and beyond to get to know you as a more than just clients, and really treats you like friends that she deeply cares about. By the time our wedding, we were so excited to have Kara around as our trusted photographer AND friend. Her work is truly stunning, and all of our photos from both engagement and the wedding are more gorgeous than we could have ever dreamed of! Booking Kara will be the easier vendor choice you make for your wedding, and we would choose her a million times over if we could (and we will, because she better be ready for us to call on her for photos for the rest of our lives!!). Mackenzie + Megan xoxo Learn more the way it felt photography that looks Want Even More? let's get social

Matthew Hinders-Anderson / Fonts Fonts for a progressive future . Fonts for a progressive future . Fonts for people fighting for a better future. Free for all non-commercial use. Read More Fonts are the single most important tool for making a strong visual identity (come at me, photographers/ illustrators/ logomakers). Fonts are the voice that our text speaks in, and text is everywhere. We're reading and writing all day, every day. Your text needs to speak in a voice that's unique, consistent, and reinforces your message. Back in 2013, I was making graphics for a project run mostly by volunteers. Being a designer, I wanted to use all the nice professional fonts I was accustomed to, but I immediately hit a roadblock âÂ there was no budget to pay for other volunteers to use those fonts. So I decided that if the good-looking, freely-distributable fonts I wanted didn't exist (the free font scene was especially bleak in 2013), I was gonna have to make them myself. If you're an activist, an academic, or anyone just trying to make this world a better place for humans to live out our lives, please take these fonts and use them for whatever you need.

About Arroyo Big, bold, with a little old west flavor. Arroyo is a chunky wedge serif typeface with sharp, exaggerated serifs. Originally drafted for The Equation Campaign in 2020 â we didn't end up using the typeface in the final brand typography.

Drawing inspiration from typefaces like RaisonnÃ©, Avant Garde, Gill Sans Kayo ( fuck Eric Gill, though ) and the cover of Mort Garson's 1976 album Plantasia , Mort aims to blend sharp and geometric with quirky and offbeat. Mort is a variable font with a "weight" axis, so you're using an app that supports it, you can freely adjust the weight to be exactly as bold or as light as you need. Details Released 2020.

Klima Ultralight Light Regular Medium Bold Heavy Ultra Ultralight Italic Light Italic Regular Italic Medium Italic Bold Italic Heavy Italic Ultra Italic About Klima (pronounced KLEE-muh ) Simple and versatile. Designed first and foremost to be a body font suited for paragraph text. The very light and very bold weights can make for a nice title or headline, though. The earliest versions of Klima were my first serious attempts at making a typeface. It started as an attempt to make a softer, more relaxed version of DIN but over the years and after many, many, many revisions, Klima eventually settled into its own personality. Fun fact â FF DIN designer Albert-Jan Pool once made said the italics were "brutal"... and he wasn't totally wrong (I redrew the italics).

Zohran Mamdani and Michael Gianaris Share Copy Link Facebook X (Twitter) Bluesky Pocket Email Ad Policy People sit on an MTA bus as the sun sets along 72nd Street on June 12, 2024, in New York City. (Gary Hershorn / Getty Images) “That $2.90 is killing us all.” That’s Cicely Blatch , a bus rider in the Bronx, talking about how prohibitively expensive transit in New York City has become. Blatch is not alone—one in five New Yorkers in 2023 struggled to afford the $2.90-a-ride subway and bus fares. Blatch rides the Bx18 bus every day—sometimes multiple times a day. These trips accumulate and can break her budget. Public transit in New York wasn’t always this way. In the past, it was cheaper , taking less of every dollar earned by New Yorkers. A ride didn’t break $1 in inflation-adjusted dollars until 1948 and $2 until 1970—66 years after the MTA’s first subway opened. It was a lifeline—the thing that made New Yorkers’ lives possible. Today, the cost of a ride is just one more example of a cost-of-living crisis . And for the average bus rider who makes less than $30,000 a year, this crisis is even more acute . That’s exactly why we created the fare-free bus pilot for New Yorkers. A Success Story Cicely Blatch. (Kara McCurdy) We designed the fare-free bus pilot to be a trailblazing program in which the MTA offered free service on five bus lines across New York City, one in each borough, including Blatch’s Bx18. The program lasted from September 24, 2023, until this past Sunday, serving nearly 50,000 weekday riders. Like similar fare-free bus programs in Kansas City and Boston , the Fare-Free Pilot hoped to offer working-class New Yorkers economic breathing room while also making their commute safer. With the end of this pilot, one thing is clear: It was a resounding success. The pilot firstly dramatically increased ridership. Across all five fare-free bus lines, the MTA reported a 30 percent increase in ridership on weekdays and 38 percent on weekends, with 23 percent of riders reporting that they made the trip because it was free. It also provided clear economic relief to low-income riders. The highest uptick in new riders was from individuals earning less than $28,000. Current Issue May 2025 Issue Forty-four percent of riders took the free bus for errands and leisure, allowing them to more freely contribute to New York’s economy. And for Blatch, the fare-free bus pilot gave her more freedom to pay for daily necessities. “This means I’ll take the bus more.… I’ll use this money to cover more bills.” Safety in our public transit system has continued to be a chief concern for New Yorkers. Fare-free buses also offer us a compelling answer on how to deliver safer public transit. Across the five routes we made free, assaults on bus operators dropped by 38.9 percent . This strongly mirrors what happened in Kansas City : After introducing fare-free buses, security incidents dropped 39 percent from 2019 to 2020. By eliminating the fare-box, riders did not need to interact with bus operators, interactions that were often the source of altercations. J.P. Patafio, a TWU Local 100 vice president who represents bus operators in Brooklyn, put it this way: The “fare box is responsible for 50 percent of the assaults on my operators. Free bus service would make my bus operators’ job much safer.” The pilot had positive effects on the environment, too: Eleven percent of new riders used the bus instead of a car or taxi they used prior, thus reducing city-wide emissions. A Paradigm Shift Far too often, crises —often self-imposed ones—warp our transportation policy decisions. The most recent example of this was Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision to delay congestion pricing—throwing the MTA into a solvency crisis . Yet we cannot let public transit be trapped in endless cycles of financial emergencies. The MTA’s strategic priority is to move New Yorkers where they need to go in a safe, reliable, and accessible way. As lawmakers, we must ask: How can we most effectively fulfill the MTA’s mission? Fare-free bus transit is one clear answer. Continuing to make buses free in New York is more attainable than you might believe. We can make all New York City buses free for just under $800 million, or $50 million less than what New York spent on the new Buffalo Bills stadium. As we approach New York’s next budget cycle, it is critically important to resolve the MTA’s fiscal insolvency. Yet our task at hand is greater than this. It’s time to go beyond the crisis-fix-crisis paradigm and make public transit work for all. So much of what we have been fighting for is exactly what the MTA itself wants: a system that moves millions of New Yorkers. While the fare-free pilot is sunsetting, it showed us the true value of public transit as a public good: a transit system that can be safe, reliable, and universally accessible. The proof is in the numbers: Fare-free service improved public transit by virtually all measures. Now, it’s time to make this a reality for every New Yorker across this city.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent Fast, fare free buses The Department of Community Safety No cost childcare City-owned grocery stores Housing by and for New York Cracking down on bad landlords $30/hour by 2030 Baby baskets for New York’s newborns Climate Healthcare Labor Education Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

Meanwhile, CUNY – an engine of opportunity and economic mobility for New Yorkers – is crumbling and perpetually underfunded. It’s time we REPAIR – Repeal Egregious Property Accumulation and Invest it Right! – and ensure Columbia & NYU pay their taxes. Under New York State law, private universities benefit from charitable status, so they don’t pay property taxes like other private landholders. This exemption costs New York City over $650 million in revenue each year. But two universities receive the biggest write-offs: Columbia and NYU. Together, they account for almost half of the total cost of real property tax exemptions given to private universities in NYC, totaling $321 million. That’s why we’ve introduced legislation to repeal the real property tax exemption given to private universities in New York whose annual property taxes cost $100 million or more. These universities accumulate properties across the city and rob the State’s tax base of critical revenue. In fact, Columbia is the largest private landowner in NYC , and the value of both NYU and Columbia’s total property holdings has more than tripled since the 1990s. Despite astronomical combined endowments of over $20 billion, these institutions aim to get richer through land grabs, and it works. We aren’t just going to repeal these real property tax exemptions for the worst actors, we’re going to send the resulting revenue to CUNY – which propels  thousands of low income New Yorkers into the middle class yet has suffered from decades of austerity budgets.

With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties. The worst landlords will be put out of business. $30/hour by 2030. In the world’s richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn’t mean living in poverty. But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.

About Platform Endorsements Press Volunteer Zohran Mamdani is running for Mayor to lower the cost of living for working class New Yorkers. Zohran Mamdani   This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. This campaign is for every person who believes in the dignity of their neighbors and that the government's job is to actually make our lives better. Meet Zohran Zohran Kwame Mamdani is a New York State Assemblymember and democratic socialist running for Mayor. Born in Uganda and raised in New York City, he has fought for the working class in and outside the legislature: hunger striking alongside taxi drivers to achieve more than $450 million in transformative debt relief, winning over $100 million in the state budget for increased subway service and a successful fare-free bus pilot, and organizing New Yorkers to defeat a proposed dirty power plant. The cost of living is crushing working people but Zohran believes that government can lower costs and make life easier in our city — he’ll use every tool available to bring down the rent, create world class public transit, and make it easier to raise a family. Join Zohran for NYC This campaign is about talking to thousands of New Yorkers across the city about how we make this city work better for the many and not the few. And to do this, we need you. Join an upcoming canvass (or two!) and learn how to have positive conversations with New Yorkers about freezing the rent, free and fast buses, universal childcare and more! No experience is required. All canvasses start with a training and you will be paired up with a partner if you are new to this. We can't wait to see you! Sign up to volunteer New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier. Freeze the rent. A majority of New Yorkers are tenants, and more than two million of them live in rent stabilized apartments. These homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city’s working class. Instead, Eric Adams has taken every opportunity to squeeze tenants, with his hand-picked appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board jacking up rents on stabilized apartments by 9% (and counting)–the most since a Republican ran City Hall. As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent. The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis. The Mayor has the power to change that. Fast, fare free buses. Public transit should be reliable, safe and universally accessible. But one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the ever rising fare. Adding insult to injury: our city’s buses are the slowest in the nation, robbing working people of precious time for family, leisure and rest. Zohran won New York’s first fare-free bus pilot on five lines across the city. As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way. Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve. The Department of Community Safety All New Yorkers deserve to be safe. But the Adams administration has failed to deliver the sense of safety and security that everyone should feel walking down our streets, riding our subways, or taking our buses. Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%. Read more in the NYT , and the full proposal here . No cost childcare. After rent, the biggest cost for New York’s working families is childcare. It’s literally driving them out of the city: New Yorkers with children under six are leaving at double the rate of all others. The burden falls heaviest on mothers, who are giving up paying jobs to do unpaid childcare. Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers. It will foster early childhood development, save parents money and keep our families in the city they call home. City-owned grocery stores. Food prices are out of control. Nearly 9 in 10 New Yorkers say the cost of groceries is rising faster than their income. Only the very wealthiest aren’t feeling squeezed at the register. As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!) , we should redirect public money to a real “public option.” Housing by and for New York. We need a lot more affordable housing. But for decades, New York City has relied almost entirely on changing the zoning code to entice private development – with results that can fall short of the big promises. And the housing that does get built is often out of reach for the working class who need it the most. As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. Any 100% affordable development gets fast-tracked: no more pointless delays. And Zohran will fully staff our City’s housing agencies so we can actually get the work done. For the additional housing we need, Zohran will initiate a Comprehensive Plan for New York City to create a holistic vision for affordability, equity, and growth. This planning will allow NYC to address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning, increase density near transit hubs, end the requirement to build parking lots and proactively chart our future. Cracking down on bad landlords. One in ten renter households reported a lack of adequate heat last winter. One in four reported mice or rats in their homes. Half a million live in poor quality housing. Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings. Tenants will be able to schedule and track inspections with a revamped 311. If a landlord refuses to make a repair, the City will do it and send them the bill. And in the most extreme cases, when an owner demonstrates consistent neglect for their tenants, the City will decisively step in and take control of their properties.

He is the antithesis of politics for show. He has proven to be what many voters now think is impossible: an elected official for the people. Can Zohran Mamdani, a Socialist and TikTok Savant, Become N.Y.C. Mayor? In the crowded race for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani has become a magnet for attention, ascending in the polls and raising money through a mix of social media savvy and a plain-spoken, everyman approach. The Democrats Are Losing the Social Media Wars. This Young Socialist Is Changing That. As Democrats around the country debate moderation, doing nothing or pursuing a politics of abundance — calling for government to stop getting in the way of things like building housing with over-regulation — Mamdani is an example of another path, one that follows in the footsteps of Sanders by lifting up concrete leftist policies toward a social safety net and affordable cost of living. The Happiest Democrat in America A recent surge of glowing profiles and features have underlined the New York state assemblyman’s unlikely No. 2 position in polls for mayor, behind only Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who leads the race. They tend to point to his acumen online, especially on TikTok—this kind of video is a prime example—and his ambidextrous appeal to different voters despite his unapologetic democratic socialist politics. His fundraising, driven by small donors, has topped $8 million. He is the rare Democrat who is meeting the most stark and uncertain moment in the party’s recent history with a message that’s both urgent and, against all odds, upbeat. Mamdani maxes out fundraising for NYC mayoral primary, campaign says The democratic socialist, who is currently serving as a state assemblymember from Queens, said he plans to announce Monday that his campaign is the first in the New York City mayor's race to hit the fundraising cap. He said he has raised more than $8 million with projected matching funds from about 18,000 donors citywide and has done so at a faster rate than any campaign in city history. Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Will Run Against Mayor Adams Mr. Mamdani, who has called on Mr. Adams to resign, said in an interview that the mayor had failed New Yorkers. He said that he would focus his campaign on addressing the city’s affordability crisis. ‘Working-class New Yorkers are being pushed out of the city they built’: why Zohran Mamdani is running for mayor In 2021, Mamdani went on a 15-day hunger strike to protest predatory loans that targeted the taxi drivers who purchased “medallions”, the physical certificate required to operate a yellow cab. The city eventually caved and struck a deal with medallion loan guarantors, securing $450m in transformative debt relief for these drivers. Twenty Minutes With Queens State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Candidate to Unseat Mayor Eric Adams In the crowded 2025 mayoral primary race, Zohran Mamdani stands out. The 33-year-old Queens State Assemblymember was behind the City's first free bus pilot , introduced legislation that would bar charities from funding illegal Israeli settlements, and went on a hunger strike to secure debt relief for taxi drivers. Mamdani was born and raised in Uganda until he moved to New York at the age of seven, and would be the city's first Muslim mayor. N.Y.C. Grocery Prices Are High. Could City-Owned Stores Help?

But that’s exactly what it means for working people today, even with the hard-won increase in the state minimum wage. When incomes don’t match the true cost of living, government services have to make up the difference – effectively subsidizing low wage employers. As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives. Baby baskets for New York’s newborns. Each year, 125,000 New Yorkers are born across our city – but the cost of living crisis can make it difficult for new families to give them a healthy start. Building on the success of more than 90 similar programs around the world, the Mamdani administration will provide new parents and guardians with a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books. Each NYC Baby Basket will also include a resource guide of information on the City’s newborn home visiting program, breastfeeding, post-partum depression and more. These are critical resources for combating postpartum maternal mortality and increasing trust in government as well. At less than $20 million a year, it’s a relatively small investment with potentially huge rewards for healthy development and family stability – as demonstrated by countless programs around the globe. Climate Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies. Greening New York has been at the heart of Zohran’s time in elected office. He fought to establish the Build Public Renewables Act, the All-Electric Buildings Act, defeat a dirty fracked gas plant in his Assembly district (NRG) and to #FixtheMTA and #GetCongestionPricingRight—winning an unprecedented $100M+ in operating funds for our subways and buses and creating NYC’s first successful fare-free bus pilot . As Mayor, Zohran will continue these efforts and lead a massive decarbonization and climate resiliency process citywide. This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes, as he has in the past . Healthcare Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits. As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support. Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more. Labor As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. Education Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.
