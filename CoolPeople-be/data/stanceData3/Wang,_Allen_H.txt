Fox Foundation works to ensure government policies accelerate the development of new, improved Parkinson's disease therapies and increase quality of life for people with Parkinson's and their families. Want to get involved in Parkinson's public policy? Sign up to join our policy network at michaeljfox.org/advocacy . Our public policy work covers three priority areas: Further Parkinson’s Disease Research Basic research is the backbone of drug development, and the federal government funds more of this research, through U.S. taxpayers' contributions, than any other entity. Robust federal support is critical to moving better treatments and cures forward. Federal Research Funding Sufficient funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense is key to driving progress. See More Federal Research Funding Sufficient funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense is key to driving progress. Data Collection Increased demographic information about people with Parkinson’s can help researchers refine and target their work.

Environmental Risk Factors Research into chemicals and toxins associated with Parkinson's can build greater understanding of disease risk. See More Environmental Risk Factors Research into chemicals and toxins associated with Parkinson's can build greater understanding of disease risk. Support Therapy Development and Approvals As new medications and devices approach market, they must request Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to be made available to the public. The FDA requires a significant budget to carry out its regulatory responsibilities and protect public health. It's also crucial that the agency understands patient priorities in order to address gaps in the Parkinson’s treatment strategy. FDA Funding The agency requires adequate staff and resources in order to approve therapies efficiently. See More FDA Funding The agency requires adequate staff and resources in order to approve therapies efficiently. Amplifying Patients' Needs To bring treatments to market, the FDA must understand patients’ needs and the latest ways to meet them. See More Amplifying Patients' Needs To bring treatments to market, the FDA must understand patients’ needs and the latest ways to meet them. Safeguard Access to Care and Support Services Access to health services and treatments is an important part of any care regimen. For those living with Parkinson's disease today, these factors directly impact quality of life. Resources such as government benefits, comprehensive insurance coverage and emerging technologies can help improve well-being. To ensure the Foundation’s policy efforts in this area are in line with the patient perspective, The Michael J. Fox Foundation has established a guiding set of health care principles . Federal Health Programs Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration are vital to helping patients receive care. See More Federal Health Programs Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration are vital to helping patients receive care. Telehealth The remote delivery of health care services allows more patients to see disease experts and helps conserve costs. See More Telehealth The remote delivery of health care services allows more patients to see disease experts and helps conserve costs. Accessing Medications To maintain quality of life and independence, people with Parkinson’s need prompt and affordable access to medications that are effective in treating the disease’s symptoms. See More Accessing Medications To maintain quality of life and independence, people with Parkinson’s need prompt and affordable access to medications that are effective in treating the disease’s symptoms. Mental Health Services People with Parkinson’s need access to mental health care providers. See More Mental Health Services People with Parkinson’s need access to mental health care providers. Support for Care Partners Individuals caring for a loved one with Parkinson's need comprehensive resources to help manage their responsibilities. See More Support for Care Partners Individuals caring for a loved one with Parkinson's need comprehensive resources to help manage their responsibilities. Other Assistance Several organizations provide information and other supports to help people with Parkinson's access health care and prescriptions. See More Other Assistance Several organizations provide information and other supports to help people with Parkinson's access health care and prescriptions. How the Public Policy Team Works The Foundation's Public Policy team elevates the needs of people with Parkinson’s and their loved ones by meeting regularly with members of Congress and federal agency staff in Washington to educate them on issues of importance to the Parkinson’s community, including government insurance programs . The Foundation also drafts letters to policymakers to push for policies favorable to Parkinson’s research and care. This work may be accomplished independently, through the Unified Parkinson's Advocacy Council (a group of national, regional and state Parkinson's organizations that gather input on community priorities), or by partnering with other research- and patient-focused organizations in coalitions. For example, through our memberships in the American Brain Coalition and Partners for Better Care, the Foundation works with like-minded organizations to urge Congress to support patients and families. By collaborating in this way, the voice of the Parkinson’s community is amplified in the policymaking process. Political Campaigns Political Campaigns The Michael J.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research believes federal investment in Parkinson’s disease research will help reduce the burden on Medicare, and Social Security. Parkinson’s disease costs our country $52 billion every year: Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spend $25.4 billion every year on people with Parkinson’s; American families and individuals spend $26.5 billion every year to cover all the other costs of Parkinson’s disease. National Institutes of Health (NIH) The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research strongly supports robust and reliably growing federal funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the largest public funder of Parkinson’s research, investing hundreds of millions of dollars each year to better understand the disease. NIH funding is given to thousands of scientists across the country whose research lays the foundation for improved diagnostics, new treatments and a cure for Parkinson’s. Sustained and predictable increases to the NIH budget ensure researchers can continue their life-changing work. Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program/Parkinson’s Research Program The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research strongly supports the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program for Parkinson’s disease (known as the Parkinson's Research Program (PRP). The only Parkinson’s-specific item in the federal budget, the PRP aims to understand the links between military service and Parkinson’s disease, including toxin exposure and traumatic brain injury. The program fills research gaps by supporting studies that other agencies do not fund. It is estimated that 110,000 U.S. military veterans are living with Parkinson’s disease. Funding for this research is important to them, as well as current and future military servicemembers who may be diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Close Federal Research Funding The Michael J.

Funding for this research is important to them, as well as current and future military servicemembers who may be diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Close Data Collection Estimates indicate that one in six Americans has a neurological condition. However, we don't have accurate and comprehensive information on how many people are living with the disease, who they are and where they are located. The ability to adequately acquire data will provide a foundation for evaluating and understanding aspects of neurological conditions that we currently do not have a good understanding of. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research believes that data collection and analysis is critical for the future planning of health care. In 2016, the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was enacted and signed into law. In 2018, the CDC began work to establish the NNCSS, embarking first on a two-year pilot with Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis with the ultimate goal of expanding the system to all neurological diseases and conditions. The database gathers patient information related to age, race, sex, geographic location and family history. This data could help scientists understand many aspects of neurological diseases, such as clusters of diagnoses in certain geographic regions, differences in the number of men and women diagnosed with these diseases, and variability in health care practices among patients. The Michael J. Fox Foundation and Parkinson's advocates across the country will continue to work to ensure the NNCSS receives adequate federal funding so that it remains an important resource for researchers. Research Transparency The Michael J. Fox Foundation believes transparency is critical in scientific research . The Foundation supports a general policy of open data sharing among the scientific community and believes this practice speeds discovery and replication and deepens the public’s trust in findings. In addition, access to underlying raw data and initial analysis allows scientists to check each other’s work and can help catch errors or overlooked factors. This openness and transparency must be balanced with the need to protect patient privacy and confidentiality. We oppose any policies that threaten patient rights for the sake of open source science without mitigating factors. State Parkinson's Registries Comprehensive, population-wide data collection at the state level can provide researchers with access to de-identified patient data that can help them determine trends, clusters, and other factors that can help advance Parkinson's disease research. The Michael J. Fox Foundation has developed resources for stakeholders in this space to develop their registries in a sustainable manner and to have a head start in understanding the technological considerations when planning for registry success. Close Data Collection Estimates indicate that one in six Americans has a neurological condition. However, we don't have accurate and comprehensive information on how many people are living with the disease, who they are and where they are located. The ability to adequately acquire data will provide a foundation for evaluating and understanding aspects of neurological conditions that we currently do not have a good understanding of. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research believes that data collection and analysis is critical for the future planning of health care. In 2016, the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was enacted and signed into law.

Close Research Freedom Research freedom has been a core value of The Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Michael J. Fox personally, since the Foundation's inception. MJFF advocates for policies that support access to a wide range of scientific resources to speed urgently needed discoveries. We believe it is a human right to insist that every promising avenue of research be followed in pursuit of potentially life-transforming treatments for all diseases, including Parkinson's. Medical Cannabis The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research supports removing unnecessary barriers impeding safe and legal access to cannabis for medical research purposes Restrictions, including cannabis’ status as a Schedule I controlled substance, have obstructed research into its potential therapeutic benefits for Parkinson’s disease. Eliminating these barriers to research will allow scientists to determine if medical cannabis may safely and effectively help people manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s. Stem Cell Clinics The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research urges people with Parkinson’s disease to view so-called clinics offering stem cell therapies for Parkinson’s with “buyer beware” skepticism. Currently, there are no approved or accepted stem cell treatments for Parkinson’s. Stem Cell Research The Foundation believes public policy regulating taxpayer-funded research has an obligation to promote research freedom. Currently, there are no approved or accepted stem cell treatments for Parkinson’s disease. Ethical and responsible access to a wide range of human tissues — including fetal tissue and adult, embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells — is crucial to the discovery of new treatments for Parkinson’s. We believe more research needs to be done around stem cells as a potential treatment for Parkinson’s. Policies that prevent this work unnecessarily delay urgently needed scientific data which could lead to breakthroughs to improve human health.

Close Environmental Risk Factors The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, although research points to a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Certain chemicals, such as nicotine and caffeine, have been found to protect dopaminergic neurons. Others, such as paraquat, increase production of certain oxygen derivatives that may harm cellular structures and cause Parkinson’s disease. Recent research links paraquat and several other herbicides to the development of Parkinson’s pathology and symptoms. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research supports measures that reduce the production and use of industrial or agricultural chemicals that possibly cause neurological damage in humans.

Close FDA Funding The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) needs robust funding to move new therapies into patient hands. The FDA assures the safety and efficacy of drugs, medical devices and biological products. Before a therapy can be made available to the public, the FDA reviews it and, if it meets the required criteria, approves it. Prior to FDA approval, new treatments undergo years of extensive clinical trial testing to investigate two important factors: is the therapy safe for patients to use and does it actually work? The Parkinson’s disease community depends on the FDA to move potentially life-changing therapies through an efficient but rigorous review and approval process. In the last few years, the FDA has approved several new symptomatic treatments for Parkinson's, and a number of new therapies are in late-stage clinical testing. The Michael J. Fox Foundation advocates for sufficient funding for the FDA so the agency can effectively bring treatments from clinical trials to pharmacy shelves. In recent years, Congress has given the FDA additional responsibilities but has not provided the increased funding or resources for successful implementation. To fulfill its expanding mission and keep up with evolving science and technology, the agency’s budget and staff levels must be supported.

Close Amplifying Patients' Needs In order for government regulators to effectively review and approve new therapies, it is important for them to be aware of the unmet needs of patients. People living with Parkinson’s are well aware of the gap in treatment options for many aspects of life with the disease. As researchers and drug makers work to address these symptoms, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an important partner in this effort. After clinical trials conclude, the agency reviews therapies, approving those that meet rigorous safety and efficacy standards. The Michael J. Fox Foundation works with people with Parkinson’s disease to amplify their priorities during therapy development and throughout the FDA approval process. This advocacy work helps drug makers and government regulators better understand which symptoms or areas of Parkinson's should be targeted to best improve quality of life, as well as how to design clinical trials to meet these needs. And, because lawmakers and federal agencies are in charge of setting therapy approval criteria, MJFF advocates for policies that move new treatments through the most efficient review process while still upholding strict safety and efficacy standards. As patient priorities evolve, the field of Parkinson’s research is changing. Scientists are now incorporating new devices and technologies into their work. The Foundation collaborates with policymakers and government regulators to ensure they’re in tune with these new research approaches, including unique trial designs and the right measurements to determine if potential therapies are successful. For example, when there was no standardized way to measure the impact of dyskinesia drugs in clinical trials, MJFF funded the development and validation of the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale. This tool is now widely accepted by clinicians, researchers and regulators as a method for evaluating the potential benefit of new dyskinesia therapies. As researchers and drug developers pursue new avenues of research, MJFF will continue to work with policymakers and the FDA to represent the patient perspective.

Close Federal Health Programs People with Parkinson’s disease rely on a number of federal programs to access the health care services and financial support they need to live well. With more than 90 percent of people with Parkinson's disease on Medicare , and 30 percent of those individuals also eligible for Medicaid , these programs are vital to helping patients receive quality health care. For the estimated 110,000 U.S. veterans living with Parkinson’s, it’s critical that the Department of Veterans Affairs understands the military service-related links to Parkinson's and offers appropriate benefits and health services. The Social Security Administration , too, is critical to many people with Parkinson's. It gives financial benefits to certain people with Parkinson’s who can no longer work or have limited income. The Michael J. Fox Foundation and members of the Parkinson's community advocate for adequate resources for these programs so they can operate effectively and provide patients with the benefits necessary to maintain quality of life and independence. A lack of funding could cause changes to benefit coverage, forcing people with Parkinson’s to choose between the services they need and the services they can afford. Additionally, the Foundation educates program staff on Parkinson’s and the priorities of patients. As these programs institute rules and regulations regarding which conditions and benefits they cover, it is important that they understand what it means to live with the disease. Only then can they meet the needs of people with Parkinson’s. Pre-existing Conditions, Coverage limits, and Disability Every individual with Parkinson’s disease has a pre-existing condition , and legislative changes that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums based on health status will significantly raise expenses and limit access for people with Parkinson’s. Similar expense and access limitations would arise as a result of any legislative changes to essential health benefit coverage. Currently, health plans are prevented from setting annual and lifetime caps on essential health benefits — health benefits which individuals with Parkinson’s disease rely on to meet their needs. Chronic conditions and disability are also common in older adults. In its advanced stages, PD is recognized by the federal government as a disability. This allows patients to secure the protections of the American with Disabilities Act. Individuals with disabilities cannot be discriminated against due to their disability. The Michael J. Fox Foundation supports reducing health disparities for patients with disabilities and working toward health promotion and wellness for PD patients to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are protected. The Social Security Disability Insurance program and the Social Security Income program need to remain financially viable to continue their benefits to individuals in need of resources for health and living expenses.

Close Telehealth The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research supports the expansion of telehealth to increase access to the special care necessary to diagnose and treat Parkinson’s disease. People with Parkinson’s benefit from seeing a movement disorder specialist — a physician with additional training in Parkinson’s — for both diagnosis and treatment of the disease. However, these specialists often are located only in major metropolitan areas and are not accessible to those living in suburban and rural areas. People with Parkinson’s experience limited mobility and may be unable to travel to receive care. The delivery of health services through telehealth (videoconference, phone calls, mobile phones and devices, apps) provides access to care for more people with PD and, often, at a lower cost. Policymakers must lift restrictions on telehealth and promote broad access to these services for people with Parkinson’s in an effort to assist them in adequately treating and managing their disease.

As Parkinson’s disease advances, many patients may require considerable assistance with their regular daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, as well as coordination of health care and administration of complicated medication regimens. Caregiving, which usually falls to a relative, takes a considerable emotional, physical and financial toll, often leading to the care partner’s own health-related implications. Increased support services, including respite care, for family caregivers are necessary to ensure quality of life for both care partners and people living with Parkinson’s.

Fox Foundation’s (MJFF) agenda is focused on building improved knowledge about the lived experience of Parkinson's disease, finding an objective test for Parkinson’s, engaging patients in research and supporting the development of new treatments and a cure. The Michael J. Fox Foundation’s research strategy — projects and activities we fund and prioritize for scientific attention and problem-solving — evolves rapidly in concert with advances made in Parkinson’s disease (PD) research. The past two decades have brought substantial growth in understanding PD, in particular the role of genetics and the disease mechanisms that are influenced by genetic changes. This has led to the development and testing of several experimental therapies that have the potential to slow or stop progression — patients’ greatest unmet need. While we have made progress, much remains to be discovered. Our relentless pursuit of a cure requires a dedicated and significant supply of human and financial capital. MJFF has funded over $1 billion in research programs to date, setting priorities in our portfolio that build on the field’s unprecedented momentum.  Given our knowledge to date and the continued unknowns around the causes and contributors to Parkinson’s disease and related parkinsonisms, we have set the following areas of focus: Leverage improved knowledge of diseases of the brain to advance precision medicine approaches that can support the development of disease-modifying treatments (those that could slow or stop progression of disease) Use an integrated (“roadmap”) approach to understanding Parkinson's disease, drug development and the measurement of therapeutic activity/outcome in order to translate complex disease understanding into new treatments faster Facilitate late-stage development and approvals of therapies by advancing patients’ role in research and addressing policy, regulator and payer considerations related to new therapies Continue investment in developing, participating and/or leading multistakeholder collaborations and consortia to increase knowledge-sharing, learning and impact Engage the patient community regionally/nationally, online, at community events and in all relevant settings to educate and inform them of their vital role in helping us achieve our mission by participating in clinical trials and advocacy and grassroots activities  Fundraise for a Cure Thousands of Team Fox members worldwide are turning their passions and interests into millions in funding for Parkinson's research. Join the Parkinson's Policy Network By telling your personal story, you can shape policymakers' decisions on issues of importance to the Parkinson's community. "This is an optimistic time for Parkinson's drug development... it is now more critical than ever that MJFF is positioned to continue supporting PD therapeutic research."

Fox and Executive Vice President of Research Strategy Todd Sherer Our Mission  Our Promise Our Promise The Michael J. Fox Foundation is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) exists for one reason: to accelerate the next generation of Parkinson’s disease (PD) treatments. In practice, that means identifying and funding projects most vital to patients; spearheading solutions around seemingly intractable field-wide challenges; coordinating and streamlining the efforts of multiple, often disparate, teams; and doing whatever it takes to drive faster knowledge turns for the benefit of every life touched by PD. In principle, it means leveraging our core values of optimism, tenacity, collaboration, boldness, adaptability and curiosity in problem-solving to work on behalf of the 6 million people worldwide living with Parkinson’s. We put patients first Our team works tirelessly every day with one urgent goal in mind: speeding breakthroughs that patients can feel in their everyday lives.

We are risk-takers and problem-solvers We take risks other funders can’t or won’t in order to push the most promising treatments forward — an approach that in two decades has transformed the PD research field. We aspire to go out of business We deliberately hold no endowment or excessive financial reserves. We act with urgency, typically deploying funds raised within a few months for the fastest possible impact. We work to steward donations wisely and keep a tight rein on expenses. We are proud of our track record of efficiency, with 88 cents of every dollar spent since inception going straight to our programs. We operate with focus and determination in everything we do. We won't stop until a cure is found. We're on it. We take pride in the accomplishments we've made so far. But ultimately we have only one definition of success: scientific solutions that produce tangible improvements in patients' lives.

With an unbiased expert perspective and a global network of contacts, our wide-ranging view of the field lets us collaborate to solve complex problems that require different talents and target resources where they are needed most — to pay off for patients faster. It is accepted practice among private disease research funders that the most important decisions — how to allocate donor-raised dollars — are made by external scientific advisors and boards. We bucked this model from day one in favor of building an in-house team of formally trained PhDs and business-trained project managers. We’re on a mission to meet every person with Parkinson’s online or face to face. We're committed to connecting patients and families to the robust nationwide PD community. By participating in clinical trials, advocating for Parkinson's policy or engaging in our community and Team Fox events, they are helping us carry new therapies over the goal line.

While treatments are the same, younger people may experience the disease differently. Scientists are working to understand the causes behind early-onset Parkinson's. Diagnosis People with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) may have a longer journey to diagnosis , sometimes seeing multiple doctors and undergoing several tests before reaching a correct conclusion. As with Parkinson's diagnosed later in life, EOPD is diagnosed based on a person's medical history and physical examination. When younger people and their clinicians are not expecting Parkinson's disease (PD), the diagnosis may be missed or delayed. It's not uncommon for arm or shoulder stiffness to be attributed to arthritis or sports injuries before Parkinson's is eventually diagnosed. Causes In everyone with Parkinson's, both genetic changes and environmental factors likely contribute , to different degrees, to cause the disease. In younger people, especially those who have multiple family members with Parkinson's, genetics may play a larger role . Certain genetic mutations (in the PRKN gene, for example) are associated with an increased risk of early-onset PD. If you have EOPD (and particularly if you have a family history of Parkinson's), you may consider genetic testing to see if you carry one of these mutations. Testing can be done through your doctor's office but mainly is done in clinical studies since results currently don't change the medications you take. As part of research, genetic information offers valuable insights toward better understanding of the disease and potential therapies. Discuss the pros and cons with your family, your doctor and a genetic counselor. Symptoms and Progression People with EOPD are more likely to experience dystonia — prolonged muscle contractions that lead to abnormal postures, such as twisting of the foot. Also, younger people are more likely to develop dyskinesia — involuntary, uncontrolled movements, often writhing or wriggling — as a complication of long-term levodopa use combined with a long course of Parkinson's disease. Progression of disease over time is, in general, slower . Treatment Options Options for managing Parkinson's symptoms are essentially the same no matter when Parkinson's is diagnosed. To potentially delay dyskinesia, younger people may choose to postpone starting medication or begin with Parkinson's drugs other than levodopa, especially if symptoms are mild and don't interfere with work, physical or social activities. Options may be to start with an MAO-B inhibitor; amantadine; a dopamine agonist; or, when tremor is particularly prominent, an anticholinergic drug.  Physicians and researchers have long engaged in a healthy discussion over the best time to start levodopa. Some believe it's better to start sooner to control symptoms, maximize quality of life and allow a person to remain active as long as possible. Others hold off to potentially delay motor complications, such as dyskinesia. Ask your physician for his or her take on this issue and consider the pros and cons of both approaches. Work closely with your movement disorder specialist to determine which medication is right for you and when . Research into Early-Onset PD Scientists are studying the genetic connections to early-onset Parkinson's disease, such as mutations in the PRKN and PINK1 genes, and other contributing factors. That information could lead to preventive strategies and treatments. Researchers also are working diligently — often with funding and/or leadership from The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) — to develop objective tests for Parkinson's so the path to a confirmed diagnosis won't be as long. While participating in a clinical trial may be the furthest thing from one's mind when processing a EOPD diagnosis, many studies of therapies to slow or stop progression need people who were recently diagnosed and have not begun medication . Learn more about recruiting studies on our Fox Trial Finder matching tool and talk to your doctor about enrolling in trials.  Early-onset Considerations Although everyone with Parkinson's wonders what the years ahead hold, this may be top of mind in those who have a longer future with PD. Concerns often center on the potential implications of the disease on personal, family and professional desires and responsibilities. A support group of other people with early-onset Parkinson's disease may help you address some of these challenges. A local or national Parkinson's organization or your physician may be able to refer you to a EOPD group — either in-person or online. If you haven't found a group that fits your needs, consider starting your own. Employment Depending on what symptoms you have, how significant they are and what you do for a living, you may be able to continue working for a significant period of time beyond diagnosis. (Many people do.) Still, having a backup plan , including schedule changes, early retirement or even a different career, may be worthwhile. Whether and when to disclose your diagnosis to coworkers and employers are personal decisions. Having a strategy that outlines who you'll tell, how you'll guide the conversation and how you'll handle potential reactions can be helpful. Find practical tips and tools in our two-part guide : Sharing Your Parkinson's Diagnosis at Work helps people with Parkinson's develop a strategy to bring Parkinson's into the workplace. Talking about Parkinson's at Work recommends strategies for continuing conversations, handling common reactions and situations, and managing long-term professional relationships. You also may want to familiarize yourself with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in case you need to seek accommodations under these guidelines.  Finances Financial planning may take on a new light with your diagnosis. You may want to take a fresh look at your current financial status , factoring in debt and savings and thinking about the need for regular doctors' visits and medications. It's a good idea to map out future financial goals and reevaluate life insurance coverage. Explore disability and long-term care insurance options, even though they may never become necessary. Family Planning Although the data on pregnancy and PD is limited, plenty of women with Parkinson's disease have successfully carried healthy babies to term . Taking birth control pills does not mean you cannot take Parkinson's drugs, but doses may need to be adjusted. Couples living with Parkinson's might therefore wish to consider other forms of contraception.  Parenting Parents may worry about caring — physically and financially — for young children, whether their children are at increased risk of developing the disease, and how to tell them about the diagnosis. Parents in the MJFF community have found it helpful to convey the facts using words directed to the child's level of education, express optimism where possible and offer reassurance. Sometimes engaging in family activities around Parkinson's is comforting — for example, looking up answers to a child's questions together, brainstorming a school project around the topic of PD or fundraising to support research.  Motor and non-motor symptoms may pose logistical challenges when raising children. It may be useful to establish a group of family, friends and neighbors who can help when necessary — such as with babysitting or carpooling — and think about restructuring household roles and responsibilities. People in midlife may find parenting issues compounded if they are part of the "sandwich generation," caring for or supporting their own parents as well as their children. Social workers can be a good resource to lay out options for these situations. Relationships and Marriage Parkinson's can impact relationships with significant others and spouses. Talking openly and honestly about present and future concerns , as well as addressing symptoms and issues related to sexual health as they arise, can be helpful. Cooperation and flexibility — important in any partnership — become even more critical when managing life with Parkinson's together.

March 11, 2020 In most cases, the cause of Parkinson’s is unknown. This is one of the greatest challenges to better understanding the disease. Leading research has demonstrated that a combination of complicated and interrelated factors including lifestyle, environment and genetics play a role in who is diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD).

Leading research has demonstrated that a combination of complicated and interrelated factors including lifestyle, environment and genetics play a role in who is diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Focusing on one of these potential causes, The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is taking a multipronged approach to identify and eliminate environmental triggers of the disease through its federal policy, research, and community advocacy efforts. An integrated policy/research strategy allows MJFF to play a holistic role in drug development from early-stage discoveries all the way to new treatments being made available to patients. People living with PD deserve to know what causes it. And knowing more about the cause could help develop treatments to stop the disease in its tracks or even prevent it for future generations.

For example, when it comes to federal policy, we have taken a proactive strategy against the chemicals suspected most strongly to increase Parkinson’s disease risk. Paraquat, a widely used herbicide in the United States, is thought to increase the risk of PD by 320 percent. Paraquat is banned in 32 other countries (including the European Union and China) but usage in the U.S. is increasing due to crops’ resistance to other kinds of herbicides. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its review of paraquat’s registration. MJFF submitted comments and a petition with 107,000 community signatories, urging a ban. The agency is still reviewing paraquat, and will make a final decision sometime this year about whether its use will be allowed to continue.

Last year, Representative Nydia Vel á zquez (D-NY) introduced the Protect Against Paraquat Act which, if passed, would eliminate paraquat from the U.S. agricultural system. In addition to our efforts to educate members of Congress about Rep. Velázquez’s bill, we are working with community members to get state-wide bans put in place as well. And you can help take action.

Medication & Therapy Types For Motor Symptoms Help treat tremor, stiffness and slowness. Read More For Motor Symptoms Help treat tremor, stiffness and slowness.  For Non-motor Symptoms Help treat symptoms — constipation, dementia, depression, hallucinations, pain, sexual dysfunction and sleep problems, for example — that may arise throughout the course of the disease.

Therapies in Development List of select therapies in testing (those with current or previous funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation) to slow or stop Parkinson's progression, or to treat symptoms. Read More Therapies in Development List of select therapies in testing (those with current or previous funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation) to slow or stop Parkinson's progression, or to treat symptoms.  All available medications and therapies aim to ease symptoms and improve quality of life. Patients' greatest unmet need remains a disease-modifying therapy — one that stops or slows disease progression. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) supports research to speed cures and, for those living with Parkinson's today, to develop improved treatments for motor symptoms and expanded options for non-motor symptoms. Today's treatments are tailored to each person's unique symptoms; there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach to Parkinson's care. Most often, people start drug therapy when symptoms interfere with the ability to do what they want or need to do. Deep brain stimulation may be an option when medications do not work as well or when people experience side effects such as dyskinesia. Exercise also can help manage Parkinson's symptoms, and some early-stage research shows it may help protect the brain. Work with your physician and a physical therapist to develop a safe and enjoyable exercise regimen. When and which treatments to begin are personal decisions best made with your Parkinson's doctor. When choosing therapies, consider your symptoms and how they interfere with your life, as well as potential benefits, side effects and costs. Your doctor also will consider your age and other medical conditions and medications outside of Parkinson's. A movement disorder specialist — a neurologist with additional training in Parkinson's disease — may have information on the latest treatments and research. Seeing a movement disorder specialist for your regular Parkinson's care or even only once a year can help to optimize your treatment regimen. Join the Parkinson's Policy Network By telling your personal story, you can shape policymakers' decisions on issues of importance to the Parkinson's community.

There’s a role for everyone on the road to disease discoveries and new treatments. Here we share what to know and how to get started. Six Things to Know about Joining a Study Better care and new treatments are only possible with study participant partners. Here’s what to know about research. There Is a Study for Everyone Studies need people diagnosed this year or 20 years ago. With risk factors or no connection to disease. With or without deep brain stimulation. You can find the right study to fit your profile and your needs. There Is a Study for Everyone Studies need people diagnosed this year or 20 years ago. With risk factors or no connection to disease. With or without deep brain stimulation. You can find the right study to fit your profile and your needs. Studies Need Diverse Participants All people with Parkinson’s need better treatments. Diversity in studies (race, ethnicity, geography, education level, sexual orientation, etc.) helps scientists learn more about the disease and how to stop it for all.

Diversity in studies (race, ethnicity, geography, education level, sexual orientation, etc.) helps scientists learn more about the disease and how to stop it for all. Not All Studies Test New Drugs Clinical trials testing new treatments are critical for better care. But many studies look at the causes and progression of disease. These observational studies teach about disease so we know how to stop it. Not All Studies Test New Drugs Clinical trials testing new treatments are critical for better care.

PPMI Achieves Scientific Breakthrough In 2023, PPMI scientists validated a biological test for Parkinson’s with an astonishing 93 percent accuracy. The test is capable of objectively and reliably detecting the alpha-synuclein protein, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. The discovery will transform clinical trials and rapidly revolutionize the development of treatments. This breakthrough was made possible by thousands of study participants. Now, PPMI is enrolling more volunteers to sustain this critical progress.

The discovery will transform clinical trials and rapidly revolutionize the development of treatments. This breakthrough was made possible by thousands of study participants. Now, PPMI is enrolling more volunteers to sustain this critical progress. More About PPMI The Michael J. Fox Foundation launched PPMI in 2010. Since then, the study has changed how research is done and what scientists know about the brain. PPMI follows people — with and without Parkinson's — over time to learn more about how disease starts and changes. That information can help doctors and scientists better diagnose, treat and even prevent brain disease. Some volunteers share data online. Others have tests and share biological samples at one of 50 participating medical centers in 12 countries. They see expert medical teams who can talk to them and their families about brain health. The study shares its data set — the most robust in Parkinson's research — with scientists to speed breakthroughs.  PPMI has led to many findings, including a new test for Parkinson’s disease. All data is protected; scientists who use the data must pledge to protect it too. This landmark initiative is only possible through partnerships. Field leaders and more than 40 funding partners have helped shape PPMI. Most importantly, more than 3,000 participants enrolled in PPMI. Now PPMI is recruiting more volunteers who can help advance us closer to better treatments and prevention.

What Is PPMI   What is PPMI? PPMI is our landmark initiative to better understand and measure Parkinson’s disease. More information on how disease starts and changes can point to new ways to stop it. Better tools to predict, diagnose and track Parkinson’s can speed new therapies and improve care. The PPMI study has an online platform that collects data over time. Some people can complete screening tests through the mail. Others can join PPMI at one of 50 sites in 12 countries. What is PPMI?

It does not test a new treatment. Some people in PPMI with Parkinson’s risk factors may be invited to enroll in a treatment study in the future. PPMI is planning a study testing therapies in people with some signs of disease but without a diagnosis yet. The study will test if these therapies slow disease at its earliest stages.

I don’t have Parkinson’s disease. Why is my data needed? PPMI is working toward a day when doctors can prevent Parkinson’s disease. Then they could prescribe medicines before the disease can damage the brain. To achieve this, we need to study people not diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Today doctors can assess risk for many diseases through simple tests. One example is heart disease. Doctors can predict your risk of developing heart disease by testing your blood pressure or your cholesterol levels. They can prescribe medicine to help prevent heart disease. We do not have simple medical tests like this for Parkinson’s disease. PPMI is studying people with and without Parkinson’s. That could help researchers understand how different factors affect disease risk. We hope to gain information that may help us understand who gets Parkinson’s disease, and why. This in turn could help us treat Parkinson’s earlier and better. I don’t have Parkinson’s disease. Why is my data needed? PPMI is working toward a day when doctors can prevent Parkinson’s disease.

(PPMI covers travel for potential volunteers and a study companion.) Why are males especially needed for PPMI? PPMI is studying the factors that could lead to Parkinson's disease. One of those factors is being male. Some research shows that males are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease. It may be that as many as two-thirds of people with Parkinson's are male. Scientists are exploring this understanding and the reasons behind it. That said, PPMI needs and welcomes volunteers of both sexes. Why are males especially needed for PPMI?

We strive to overcome systemic challenges and speed progress by funding therapies, supporting cutting-edge science, developing research tools, harnessing the potential of emerging technology, and mobilizing stakeholders. Our Approach Drug development for brain disease is complex. No blueprint exists to easily identify the most promising targets or critical challenges in Parkinson's research. The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is uniquely positioned to speed breakthroughs by providing scientists with the funding, tools and collaborative partnerships they need. Our research strategy directly supports promising individual projects while also addressing field-wide challenges through creative, consortium-driven solutions. Our in-house team of PhD neuroscientists and business strategists — with input from global experts in Parkinson’s disease (PD) — sets our research priorities. Through our peer-review process, more than 1,500 proposals are reviewed each year to identify and pursue research leads worldwide that hold the potential to benefit people living with Parkinson’s. Approximately 30% of our research funding goes to projects led by teams outside of the United States. And it is a core value of our Foundation that we make results of funded research available to be shared as quickly and widely as possible, thereby ensuring that every researcher has access to new information and developments that can advance the field. Our consortium approaches encourage built-in milestones that provide opportunity to troubleshoot and track progress. Working at the global nexus of Parkinson’s research, MJFF is uniquely positioned to cultivate and maintain a field-wide perspective on new learnings and emerging challenges. The ever-evolving research landscape shapes the next steps in the journey to attain our singular goal: new and improved treatments, up to and including a cure, for Parkinson's. At any given moment, our aim is to prioritize the field's most important activities, articulate their importance, gain stakeholder buy-in, and provide funding and technical assistance to push them forward.   The Answers We Want 1. Better Understanding of Parkinson's Biology Discovery research is the backbone of all therapeutic development. Basic Parkinson's science involves identifying and characterizing disease biology, measuring onset/progression and developing new treatments targeting the disease. Exploring cellular functions and pathological mechanisms in the presence of PD-implicated genetic mutations, environmental contributors, aging and other factors sets the stage for watershed advances in therapeutic development for diseases of the brain. The breakthrough discovery in 2023 of a biomarker test that detects the misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, achieved by an international coalition of scientists led by MJFF and our landmark clinical study, Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) , now makes it possible for the first time to diagnose Parkinson’s biologically, even before symptoms begin. The test is ushering in a new biological era for Parkinson’s research, revolutionizing how we understand the disease, streamlining clinical trials and accelerating therapeutic development. 1.

Translation of Biology to Patient-relevant Therapies Public and private investments worldwide continually grow the base of human understanding of biology, with newspapers reporting on intriguing new discoveries every week. But the process of translating these early-stage findings into proven and practical treatments is slow and inefficient. Translation requires a laser-like focus on chaperoning the most promising findings along the pipeline toward clinical trials, as well as deliberate investment in the building blocks that will increase the odds of clear, actionable results from those trials. 2.

An Open, Inclusive and Collaborative Research Environment Robust, collaborative, replicable research is a requirement for faster progress. The Foundation works to build an open and collaborative research environment through strategic investment in standardized tools and methods; open, real-time sharing of biosamples, data and new findings; and open communication among industry and academic scientists, as well as productive and rigorous dialogue between patients and researchers. MJFF also is assembling broad cohorts of potential research volunteers mobilized to participate in Parkinson’s studies and trials. Your Role in Research 3.

Fox, iconic actor, author and advocate whose Hollywood career has been marked by worldwide acclaim, honor and awards, launched the Foundation in 2000 after publicly disclosing his 1991 diagnosis, at age 29, with Parkinson’s disease. Michael Andrew Fox was born in 1961 in Alberta, Canada. A self-described "army brat," Fox moved many times during his childhood. His father retired from the Canadian Armed Forces in 1971 and settled the family in Burnaby, British Columbia. Michael joined the Drama Club in junior high and immediately showed natural talent as an actor. His theater teacher encouraged him to audition for a new Canadian Broadcasting Corp. series, Leo & Me . He won the part and began working steadily on TV and in local theater in Vancouver. By 17, Michael left school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. There was a slight problem when he attempted to join the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in Hollywood — another actor named “Michael Fox” was already a SAG member, forcing this new Canadian arrival to add a middle initial to his moniker. He ruled out “Michael A. Fox” for obvious reasons, and instead adopted the middle initial “J” as an homage to his favorite character actor, Michael J. Pollard. After a few lean years, Michael landed the role of Alex P. Keaton on Family Ties . The series skyrocketed to one of television’s top comedies. Movie offers soon followed, including Teen Wolf and Back to the Future — the number one movie of 1985 and a role that brought him worldwide fame. Michael won three Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his work on Family Ties . In 1988, he married his co-star, Tracy Pollan, and they welcomed their first child, Sam, a year later. During his 20s, Michael completed seven seasons of Family Ties and starred in 10 feature films, including The Secret of My Success , Casualties of War and several Back to the Future sequels. While filming Doc Hollywood in 1991, Michael developed a tremor in his pinky finger. A consultation with a neurologist revealed a surprising and devastating diagnosis: he had young-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). He was only 29 years old. Michael kept his illness under wraps for the ensuing years and worked steadily in movies, including For Love or Money , The American President , and Frighteners . In 1995, he and Tracy had twin daughters, Aquinnah and Schuyler. With a desire to remain closer to his growing family in New York City, Michael returned to series television as Deputy Mayor Mike Flaherty in ABC’s Spin City . The role won him another Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. During the series’ third season, Michael realized that he could no longer hide his Parkinson’s, which prompted him to reveal his diagnosis to the press and general public. After one more season of Spin City , Michael retired from full-time acting to focus on advocacy and fundraising for Parkinson’s disease. In the fall of 2000, he launched The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, which the New York Times has called "the most credible voice on Parkinson's research in the world." Today the world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's drug development, the Foundation has galvanized the search for a cure and is a commanding voice in scientific philanthropy. To date they have raised over $1.75 billion dollars and moved the field closer to a cure. In 2001, Michael and Tracy welcomed their fourth child, daughter Esmé. After getting the Foundation on a steady course, Michael agreed to return to acting in supporting roles — as long as he could incorporate his PD symptoms into the characters he played. He took recurring guest roles on Scrubs and Boston Legal , and earned his fifth Emmy Award playing Dwight on Rescue Me . Six more Emmy nominations followed for his critically-acclaimed role as Louis Canning on The Good Wife , and for a hilarious turn as himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm . In 2009, he produced and hosted an Emmy-nominated special for ABC, Adventures of an Incurable Optimist , which he filmed throughout the United States, India and Bhutan. Michael has spoken and written extensively about his predisposition to look at challenges, including his Parkinson's disease, through a lens of optimism and humor. Michael’s autobiography, Lucky Man , became a New York Times number one bestseller. He wrote three subsequent best-selling books: Always Looking Up ; A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future ; and No Time Like the Future . Three of his audio books were nominated for Grammy Awards, and in 2010, Always Looking Up won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album. Michael is the recipient of honorary degrees from the following academic institutions: The Karolinska Institute in Sweden (which bestows the Nobel Prize in the sciences); New York University; the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; the University of British Columbia; and Stony Brook University. He has received numerous humanitarian awards for his work, including inclusion in Time Magazine’s list of the 100 people who are transforming the world.

The good news: Most people find acceptance and quality of life after the initial adjustment period. What Is Parkinson's Disease? Parkinson’s disease (PD) occurs when brain cells that make dopamine, a chemical that coordinates movement, stop working or die . Because PD can cause tremor, slowness, stiffness, and walking and balance problems, it is called a “movement disorder.” But constipation, depression, memory problems and other non-movement symptoms also can be part of Parkinson’s. PD is a lifelong and progressive disease, which means that symptoms slowly worsen over time. The experience of living with Parkinson's over the course of a lifetime is unique to each person . As symptoms and progression vary from person to person, neither you nor your doctor can predict which symptoms you will get, when you will get them or how severe they will be. Even though broad paths of similarity are observed among individuals with PD as the disease progresses, there is no guarantee you will experience what you see in others. Estimates suggest that Parkinson’s affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide . For an in-depth guide to navigating Parkinson’s disease and living well as the disease progresses, check out our Parkinson’s 360 toolkit . What Is Parkinson's Disease? Dr. Rachel Dolhun, a movement disorder specialist and vice president of medical communications at The Michael J. Fox Foundation, breaks down the basics of Parkinson's. What Causes Parkinson's Disease? Researchers believe that in most people, Parkinson's is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. See More What Causes Parkinson's Disease? Researchers believe that in most people, Parkinson's is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. How Is Parkinson’s Diagnosed? Doctors use your medical history and physical examination to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD). No blood test, brain scan or other test can be used to make a definitive diagnosis of PD. See More How Is Parkinson’s Diagnosed? Doctors use your medical history and physical examination to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD).

Will My Children Get Parkinson's? Not necessarily. While a small percentage of Parkinson’s cases are caused by a single genetic mutation, the large majority are not. See More Will My Children Get Parkinson's? Not necessarily. While a small percentage of Parkinson’s cases are caused by a single genetic mutation, the large majority are not. Could It Be Another Disease? Early in the disease process, it may be difficult to know whether symptoms indicate Parkinson's or a disease that looks like it. See More Could It Be Another Disease? Early in the disease process, it may be difficult to know whether symptoms indicate Parkinson's or a disease that looks like it. How Can I Help Speed a Cure? Whether you have Parkinson's, or are touched by the disease in another way, every single person can play a role in the search for a cure. See More How Can I Help Speed a Cure?

Researchers believe that in most people, Parkinson's is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors . Certain environmental exposures, such as pesticides and head injury, are associated with an increased risk of PD. Still, most people have no clear exposure that doctors can point to as a straightforward cause. The same goes for genetics. Certain genetic mutations are linked to an increased risk of PD . But in the vast majority of people, Parkinson’s is not directly related to a single genetic mutation. Learning more about the genetics of Parkinson’s is one of our best chances to understand more about the disease and discover how to slow or stop its progression. Aging is the greatest risk factor for Parkinson’s, and the average age at diagnosis is 60 . Still, some people get PD at 40 or younger. ( Read more about early-onset Parkinson’s .) Men are diagnosed with Parkinson’s at a higher rate than women and whites more than other races. Researchers are studying these disparities to understand more about the disease and health care access and to improve inclusivity across care and research.  Close What Causes Parkinson's Disease?

Researchers are studying these disparities to understand more about the disease and health care access and to improve inclusivity across care and research.  Close How Is Parkinson’s Diagnosed? Doctors diagnose Parkinson’s "clinically" — the diagnosis is based on a person’s medical history, answers to certain questions and a physical examination. Any clinical diagnosis rests heavily on the physician's expertise and judgment. If you suspect you have Parkinson's, you should see a movement disorder specialist , who is a neurologist with specialized training in Parkinson’s and other movement disorders. On examination, the doctor looks for slowness, stiffness and resting tremor — the movement symptoms of Parkinson’s. ( Read more about symptoms. ) Being treated by a movement disorder specialist remains critically important as the disease progresses. Doctors may order tests to exclude other conditions that can look like Parkinson’s. DaT scan is a brain imaging test that captures detailed pictures of the dopamine system in the brain. DaT scan can't diagnose Parkinson's on its own and not everyone with suspected Parkinson’s needs this test. In some cases, though, such as when it’s difficult to distinguish Parkinson’s tremor from essential tremor (another common movement disorder), this can be a helpful addition. A biomarker test is now available to diagnose Parkinson’s objectively, based on the presence of a misfolded protein called alpha-synuclein. Called the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay, the test can detect the misfolded protein in spinal fluid in people who show clinical symptoms of the disease and also in people who have not yet shown symptoms but are at a high risk of developing PD. Use of the test is mostly limited to clinical trials but may expand once it is optimized for a less invasive fluid, such as blood. The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) has made finding a test for Parkinson’s disease one of our top priorities.   Close How Is Parkinson’s Diagnosed?

Fox Foundation (MJFF) has made finding a test for Parkinson’s disease one of our top priorities.   Close What Are the Symptoms? The symptoms of Parkinson’s and their degree of severity are different for every person. The three “cardinal” movement, or motor, symptoms are slowness of movement (bradykinesia), stiffness (rigidity) and resting tremor . Not everyone has all three symptoms and not everyone with Parkinson's has tremor. Some people also have walking problems or difficulty with balance and coordination. Non-movement, or non-motor, symptoms are sometimes called the "invisible" symptoms of Parkinson's because you can't see them from the outside. These symptoms can occur any time, even before movement symptoms or diagnosis, and differ in severity from person to person. They include constipation, depression, memory or sleep problems, and impact the quality of life for people with Parkinson's and their families. It's important to remember that even if you experience symptoms common among people with Parkinson’s, they may be from a completely different condition. Read more about Parkinson’s symptoms or take the Parkinson’s Screening Questionnaire to see if you should speak to your doctor or a movement disorder specialist about PD.

Close How Is Parkinson’s Treated? Medications are available to lessen Parkinson's movement (motor) and non-movement (non-motor) symptoms, making it possible for people to lead fulfilling and productive lives for many years.   There also are surgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and focused ultrasound (FUS), which may be an option for certain symptoms. While invasive and not for everyone, DBS can be an option in cases where medication side effects or complications, such as dyskinesia , outweigh medication's benefits.   While there is no cure or therapy to stop or slow the progression of PD, great strides are being made. Therapies to address movement symptoms and expand options for non-movement symptoms also are improving. You can do much to take control of your journey with Parkinson’s: Six tips for making your path forward with Parkinson's: Exercise regularly. Regular exercise of any type promotes general well-being and can help lessen movement and non-movement symptoms. Read more about exercise  Eat a healthy, balanced diet. A well-balanced diet containing fruits and vegetables can boost overall health and ease non-movement symptoms. Learn more about diet and Parkinson’s  Learn about Parkinson’s.

Close Will My Children Get Parkinson's? Not necessarily. While a small percentage of Parkinson’s cases are caused by a single genetic mutation, the large majority are not. Even if you carry a genetic mutation that increases your risk, your child may not inherit it. And most known genetic mutations linked to PD only increase risk ; they don’t guarantee a diagnosis. Parkinson’s and genetics is a complicated and personal topic. Talk to your doctor and consider consulting with a genetic counselor . This expert can explain what we know about Parkinson’s genetics and walk you through what genetic testing can and can’t tell you. If you decide to get genetic testing, a counselor also can interpret your results. In the last two decades, researchers moved from a predominant belief that Parkinson’s had no genetic connection to finding several genetic links to PD. Investigating these links has transformed our understanding and contributed to the development of new drugs. Genetics will help researchers continue to unlock clues about the disease and how to treat it.  Close Will My Children Get Parkinson's? Not necessarily.

Early in the disease process, it may be difficult to know whether symptoms indicate Parkinson's or a disease that looks like it. Like PD, many other movement conditions lack objective tests to diagnose them , and a person’s medical history and a doctor’s physical examination are used to make a diagnosis. Some conditions that may be mistaken for Parkinson’s include: Essential tremor . This is the most common movement disorder. It involves an involuntary, rhythmic shaking of the hands, head or voice. The tremor is present with activity, such as writing, eating or speaking. Atypical parkinsonism . This category of conditions has movement symptoms of Parkinson's plus additional symptoms not typical of Parkinson's. Compared to Parkinson's, the symptoms may progress more quickly and get less benefit from medication. Conditions include Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. Read more about atypical parkinsonism  Medication-induced parkinsonism. This is when medications, not Parkinson’s disease, cause movement symptoms (tremor, slowness and stiffness). It typically occurs when drugs that block the dopamine system, such as those for schizophrenia or major depression, are taken for long periods. Some anti-nausea medications also can cause drug-induced parkinsonism. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). This condition is caused by an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Symptoms include walking problems; memory and thinking (cognitive) changes, sometimes severe enough to interfere with daily activities (dementia); and accidental loss of urine (urinary incontinence). Doctors typically can diagnose NPH with a brain scan and lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Close Could It Be Another Disease?

Life with Parkinson's requires adjustment, and it is normal to feel overwhelmed at times. One way to regain a feeling of control is to get involved in the search for a cure by participating in research . Clinical studies are essential to develop ways to diagnose, treat and possibly predict Parkinson’s. Because clinical studies vary, many different type of volunteers are needed . One thing that stays the same, though, is the consistent need for volunteers. Whether you have Parkinson's, or are touched by the disease in another way, every single person can play a role in the search for a cure.   Close How Can I Help Speed a Cure?

Fox Foundation funds promising research with a goal to significantly improve the lives of people with Parkinson's. We welcome applications from academia and industry for support to define, measure and treat Parkinson's. We fund studies with sound scientific rationale and clear relevance for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). No idea is too novel for us to consider. We support academic and industry scientists, small biotechs, big pharma and allied care professionals. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research. How We Fund We identify projects to fund through multiple channels: Core Funding Programs: Our annual core funding programs are intentionally open-ended, calling for novel and iterative ideas across the spectrum of Parkinson's research. Targeted Funding Programs: We also issue requests for funding applications or projects that address a specific gap in understanding or patient need. Supplemental Funding: We may issue add-on funding if a project shows significant progress and continued potential. Foundation-driven Initiatives: Our Foundation sponsors and/or coordinates our own studies. More Than Money Grants from The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) come with more than money. Successful applicants get access to a network of advisors: MJFF staff and our many external partners. You may be invited to join a consortium and/or attend virtual and in-person meetings with others working in the same research area who may enrich or even partner on your project.  Research Strategy Our Foundation initiates programs and assesses funding applications through the lens of three overarching goals: 1. Better Understanding of Parkinson's Biology The variability of Parkinson's onset and progression and frequent new genetic findings tell us there is much to discover about this disease. Our portfolio ranges from novel discovery to target optimization to clinical profiling. For example, we fund work to explore: Parkinson’s pathogenesis, from genetics to environment to aging; the biology and pathology of genetic and cellular factors, such as alpha-synuclein, LRRK2, GBA, PRKN/PINK1, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy; imaging and other measurement techniques to analyze brain changes and circuitry; and the clinical experience of Parkinson’s across various cohorts. Read about the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, our flagship study toward holistic Parkinson’s understanding. Data and biosamples from the study, and funding to use them, are available to qualified researchers.  2. Translation of Biology to Patient-relevant Therapies MJFF invests heavily in all aspects of therapeutic development both to directly support individual projects with great potential to help people with Parkinson’s and to provide the field with tools applicable across targets and projects. For example, we fund projects that: screen and optimize compounds; test drug and non-pharmacological interventions in clinical trials; identify and validate biomarkers and predictive models to inform subject selection, monitor disease and measure therapeutic impact; and gather patient-reported outcomes to enrich study design. Read about the LRRK2 Safety Initiative, an unprecedented MJFF-led consortium of competitors that united to test the safety of a promising Parkinson's therapy.  3. An Open, Inclusive and Collaborative Research Environment Robust, collaborative, replicable research leads to faster progress. The Foundation works to build an open and collaborative research environment through strategic investment in: well-characterized and accessible research tools; open, real-time sharing of biosamples, data and new findings; open communication and collaboration among multidisciplinary researchers and experts; and productive and rigorous dialogue between patients and researchers. Read about Fox Insight, our online study that remotely captures patient-reported and genetic data and makes it available to the broad research community.

Close Fox Insight The largest Parkinson's clinical study, MJFF's online Fox Insight has enrolled a large, diverse cohort of more than 30,000 people — about 80 percent with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20 percent who are control volunteers. Participants complete questionnaires and surveys on their medical and family history and daily life with disease. This information helps scientists learn more about the Parkinson's experience and patient perspectives and priorities. Knowing more about life with PD and its variability can help researchers and regulators test and evaluate new therapeutic approaches. The online nature of Fox Insight — formally launched in 2017 — allows people to participate from wherever they are, without traveling to a medical clinic. And the Fox Insight study team is adding more ways to participate remotely. When you join Fox Insight, you may be eligible to receive access to the 23andMe Health + Ancestry Service at no cost, and add your genetic data to the study. Matching your genetic information with your PD experience can help us learn more about the role that genetics plays in disease. In line with the MJFF open-access philosophy, de-identified Fox Insight data will be available to the broad research community. Learn more and enroll today.

Close Digital Health Technology is presenting researchers with new ways to monitor and measure disease. Parkinson's — with its variability and movement issues — shows grand potential for use of, for example, wearable devices and smartphone applications. Many questions remain, however, on what tools are best, what data to capture and what can be learned from that information. The Foundation is helping to usher these new technologies into Parkinson's research and provide a clear path for their use. MJFF is sponsoring data collection through digital tools, such as in PPMI, and funding additional studies to capture incredible amounts of data on daily life and activities with disease. Attracting experts in analyzing that vast amount of data is critical for making meaningful insights into the progression and experience of Parkinson's disease. MJFF hosts data challenges to invite data scientists to review Parkinson's digital health data and create models or algorithms to better understand individual experiences with the disease. We also have supported studies to test how doctors can use data from a smartwatch to monitor disease and make treatment decisions. A working group of experts gathered by MJFF discusses the challenges to digital health research: How to keep up with the rapid advancement of technology? How to involve regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so they understand how these tools measure disease? Thus, the Foundation plays a unique role in supporting work and uniting key leaders to address these field-wide challenges.

Close Training Next Generation of Specialists A 2014 Harris Poll conducted on behalf of MJFF and AbbVie showed that less than half of all people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have seen a movement disorder specialist, who has additional training in Parkinson's. The survey also showed that people who did see a movement disorder specialist were more informed on the basics of PD and on clinical research opportunities. While these specialists are invaluable to patient care, there are too few of them to treat the growing number of people with Parkinson's. The Foundation is leading programs to seed the next generation of movement disorder specialists. For example, MJFF has partnered with the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society to lead an annual Movement Disorders School for Neurology Residents over the past three years. The two-day course encourages young neurologists to pursue a fellowship in movement disorders. Additionally, MJFF sponsors the Edmond J. Safra Fellowship in Movement Disorders . The program aims to grow the global base of clinician-researcher movement disorder specialists to provide patient care and conduct research that will advance understanding and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Safra Core Programs for PD Research The basis of MJFF's strategy to finding a cure and ensuring the development of new therapies is quickly directing donor-raised capital to the many promising research studies that need support. Each year, MJFF calls for applications to its Edmond J. Safra Core Programs for PD Research , which are focused on research characterizing promising PD-relevant targets, advancing the therapeutic pipeline, and identifying biomarkers and outcome measures. Complementing calls for funding applications around more targeted research priorities, these programs for PD research allow the research community to pitch its range of ideas, from better understanding the biology of Parkinson's, to developing and testing new treatments, to measuring disease and therapeutic impact.

Notably, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently published an updated proposed rule with a stated goal of increasing transparency in science at the agency. However, despite its specified purpose, this proposal would undermine sound science and put Americans’ health and the environment at risk. It would restrict the use of the best available science in the EPA’s policymaking, meaning decisions affecting millions of people could be based on inadequate information that fails to include well-supported studies by expert scientists.

This is not the first time we’ve highlighted the danger of this proposal. For nearly two years, the American Lung Association has partnered with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research (MJFF) to lead a coalition of health, medical, academic and scientific organizations informing the EPA about concerns with this proposal on science. In July 2018, efforts resulted in a letter from nearly 70 groups citing concerns with the proposal’s impact on the integrity of science and patient privacy, as well as a press conference that included representatives from MJFF and the Lung Association.

Our community knows this can sometimes be challenging and that care partners don't always receive the support they need. This week, the president took action to address this by signing the RAISE Family Caregivers Act into law. The bill directs the government to create a national strategy to better support the estimated 40 million care partners across the country. Among other things, it aims to provide caregivers with more education, respite care services and resources to navigate working while helping a loved one manage their disease. All year long, you had the ear of senators and representatives on this issue. RAISE was a major focus of lawmaker meetings during the 2017 Parkinson's Policy Forum . Advocates asked members to vote for the bill, explaining the importance of appropriate training and services for care partners. After the event concluded, Forum attendees continued to keep in touch with their lawmakers and push for RAISE's passage. Additional members of the Parkinson's community joined these efforts in November, sending emails to their representatives as the bill came under consideration in the House. Thank you to every individual who spoke out for Parkinson's care partners throughout the past year. Now, the government will begin creating the national strategy. We'll share updates on the MJFF blog as we learn more about this process. Learn more about Parkinson's disease advocacy .

Read More Care Partners Care partners play a major role in the well-being of a person with Parkinson's disease. Here we share tips for managing a loved one's care, navigating a relationship with a Parkinson's diagnosis and making time to care for oneself.  You You are an active member of your care team. Educate yourself about Parkinson's disease, and talk with your doctor and loved ones to identify helpful health care professionals, decide on treatments and connect with research studies. Establishing a comfortable, open and productive relationship with your health care providers is important for your overall care. In choosing any provider, your major considerations should be how much they know about Parkinson’s and how well they listen. Because Parkinson’s involves a wide range of symptoms including movement- and non-movement-related issues, over the course of your life with Parkinson’s you may wish to work with a variety of health care providers in addition to the doctor who primarily treats your Parkinson’s. Care teams are made not only of medical professionals. Care partners play an essential role in the health and well-being of people with Parkinson's. And you, the person with the disease, are in the driver's seat — gathering and guiding the players. You You are an active member of your care team.

Since the spring, the United States health care system has been the focal point of discussions to keep us safe and healthy, and to find a solution to slow and cure the novel coronavirus. One of the ways to do this is to keep health care appointments by transitioning them to a virtual environment. Telehealth appointments help reduce the risk of exposure by seeing health care providers while comfortably at home. And being able to conduct medical visits by telehealth means that many people with Parkinson’s may have access to a movement disorder specialist for the first time since their diagnosis — ultimately providing enhanced care.

Five months ago, in response to the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded Medicare coverage for telehealth services. This change removed geographic restrictions for Medicare telehealth appointments — expanding coverage for people living in urban and rural areas by allowing them to receive care at home instead of unnecessarily traveling to an appointment.

This change removed geographic restrictions for Medicare telehealth appointments — expanding coverage for people living in urban and rural areas by allowing them to receive care at home instead of unnecessarily traveling to an appointment. CMS also expanded the list of services they cover via telehealth, such as routine office visits, preventive health screenings, emergency care, therapeutic exercise and mental health counseling. Patients could use telehealth to conduct an e-visit or virtual check-in for a shorter visit. CMS allowed patients to use their phones for telehealth for certain services if they did not have access to devices with interactive audio-visual communication. Through these expanded flexibilities, patients could have appointments with a wide range of providers including physicians, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, movement disorder specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists.

While telehealth visits can be convenient, they may be tough to navigate especially if you do not have the technology at home. MJFF supports people living with Parkinson’s disease and suggests speaking with your health care provider to determine your care options because telehealth is not a replacement for all health care appointments.

Before the pandemic, CMS said that 13,000 telehealth visits occurred each week. By April, the number of telehealth visits skyrocketed to 1.7 million per week. The newly announced results of the Fox Insight survey on COVID-19 showed 39 percent of respondents with Parkinson’s used telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. This demonstrates the urgent need to educate patients and lawmakers about the importance of telehealth. Before the pandemic, CMS said that 13,000 telehealth visits occurred each week.

Congress is working to respond to the mounting pressure from patients and providers to pass laws and make these telehealth changes permanent. Twenty-nine Senators wrote a letter to congressional leadership on June 15, 2020 asking for the expanded access to telehealth to remain in place after the pandemic, and the Senate HELP Committee held a hearing two days later.

Improving patient access is a priority policy issue for the Foundation. Together with more than 300 other health organizations, MJFF signed a letter urging congressional leadership to make permanent the telehealth flexibilities created during the pandemic. The MJFF policy team also collaborated with other groups to support HR 7078, the Evaluating Disparities and Outcomes of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Emergency Act of 2020 . This bill calls for CMS data collection on patient utilization of telehealth, which would help CMS make evidence-based decisions on future policies and regulations.

We are anxiously waiting for Congress’ legislative response on this important issue, as well as actions CMS can take within its current authority to make telehealth permanent. The public health emergency was set to expire on July 25, 2020, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services extended it 90 days to allow these telehealth flexibilities to continue.

Fox Foundation discovered a Parkinson's biomarker — a tool that can detect the earliest biological signs of the disease in living people. What Is a Biomarker? Friends of the Foundation break down key questions about the Parkinson's biomarker, including what it means for research moving forward and how our community helped us get here. Researchers discovered this new tool by looking for abnormal alpha-synuclein, the protein that is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, in spinal fluid. The presence of abnormal alpha-synuclein reveals the disease process that occurs with Parkinson's — making it a biomarker that indicates presence of the disease. And just like commonly known biomarkers such as cholesterol, the ability to detect it early, and measure it, will lead to improved understanding of Parkinson's, new treatments to halt the disease in its tracks and, eventually, a cure.  This monumental breakthrough opens the door to more effective clinical trials and the possibility of personalized care for each Parkinson’s patient. Your support will help us get there faster. A Carefully Charted Research Journey Since 2001, The Michael J. Fox Foundation has pushed the field to develop new and innovative biomarkers for Parkinson’s . This effort was kicked into overdrive in 2010 through the Foundation-led Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. After decades of research powered by thousands of study volunteers and millions in funding, the 2023 finding marks the most significant breakthrough in Parkinson’s research since the discovery of levodopa in 1967. The biomarker tool can detect abnormal alpha-synuclein protein in the spinal fluid of people with the disease with 93 percent accuracy. This tool, called the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay (αSyn-SAA), looks specifically for misfolded and clumped alpha-synuclein protein, which damages neurons and causes the cell death that is linked to Parkinson’s disease. How will the Parkinson's biomarker impact patient care? While αSyn-SAA is now available through a doctor’s office, it doesn’t yet broadly change how doctors diagnose and treat PD. But it likely will in the future, especially as testing becomes simpler and easier to access. Hear from a movement disorder specialist about what this tool means for people with Parkinson’s today . How will the Parkinson’s biomarker impact research? Parkinson's is caused by loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Ultimately, a treatment aimed at preventing or stopping dopamine cell death is the path to a cure.  The discovery of the first Parkinson’s biomarker marks a critical inflection point for Parkinson’s research, especially in the search for therapies to slow, stop or even prevent disease. The new tool is already making clinical trials cheaper, faster and more effective. It’s also changing how we think about the disease and its symptoms, paving the way for a more personalized approach to treatment. On the heels of the biomarker breakthrough, researchers proposed the first biological staging system for Parkinson’s , which is a framework for defining and staging PD based on its underlying biology. And in September 2024, the FDA issued a letter of support endorsing use of the biomarker in research and clinical trials. Researchers are continuing to explore uses for αSyn-SAA as a tool to better understand the progression of the disease and its origins. Where We’re Headed: The Search for Additional Parkinson's Biomarkers Scientists are looking all over the body for more signs of disease presence and progression. The Michael J. Fox Foundation is funding biomarker research to improve the current tool and add new ones to our toolbox. The major avenues of pursuit include: Brain imaging — developing tools to visualize proteins linked to PD in the living brain Brain imaging — developing tools to visualize proteins linked to PD in the living brain Fluid or tissue sampling — testing levels of proteins or other markers in blood, spinal fluid (like the SAA test), urine or tissue Fluid or tissue sampling — testing levels of proteins or other markers in blood, spinal fluid (like the SAA test), urine or tissue Non-invasive tests — using technology to diagnose PD with, for example, eye tracking or to monitor progression with wearable devices Non-invasive tests — using technology to diagnose PD with, for example, eye tracking or to monitor progression with wearable devices The more information we have about the biology underpinning the disease, the better (and earlier) we can intervene. For example, doctors routinely test blood pressure and cholesterol levels and use the results in concert to determine an individual’s risk of heart disease. We likely need to use a combination of biomarkers and clinical information over time to track an individual’s Parkinson’s risk and progression.

In 2018, Congress gave the CDC funds to implement this database , called the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS). Parkinson's is one of two diseases that is included in the initial project plan for the NNCSS . While there are rough estimates of the number of people diagnosed with Parkinson's in the United States, we don't have accurate and comprehensive information on how many people are living with the disease, who they are and where they are located. This lack of core knowledge can slow Parkinson's research and therapeutic development. The NNCSS will be a valuable resource for collecting this information. The data could help scientists understand many aspects of the disease, such as clusters of diagnoses in certain geographic regions, differences in the number of men and women diagnosed with Parkinson's and variability in health care practices among patients. The Michael J. Fox Foundation is an active member of the CDC's working group to build and implement this new system.  At a meeting earlier this year at the CDC’s Washington, D.C. office, the MJFF policy team met with CDC officials to discuss the Parkinson’s community’s priorities. The CDC will be conducting a listening session in Atlanta in November to involve the broader neurological advocacy community in the planning process . to build and implement this new system.  At a meeting earlier this year at the CDC’s Washington, D.C. office, the MJFF policy team met with CDC officials to discuss the Parkinson’s community’s priorities. The CDC will be conducting a listening session in Atlanta in November to involve the broader neurological advocacy community in the planning process to build and implement this new system.  At a meeting earlier this year at the CDC’s Washington, D.C. office, the MJFF policy team met with CDC officials to discuss the Parkinson’s community’s priorities. The CDC will be conducting a listening session in Atlanta in November to involve the broader neurological advocacy community in the planning process to build and implement this new system.  At a meeting earlier this year at the CDC’s Washington, D.C. office, the MJFF policy team met with CDC officials to discuss the Parkinson’s community’s priorities. The CDC will be conducting a listening session in Atlanta in November to involve the broader neurological advocacy community in the planning process to build and implement this new system.  At a meeting earlier this year at the CDC’s Washington, D.C. office, the MJFF policy team met with CDC officials to discuss the Parkinson’s community’s priorities. The CDC will be conducting a listening session in Atlanta in November to involve the broader neurological advocacy community in the planning process Read more or sign up on the CDC's website to receive updates about the NNCSS .

It is a cornerstone of our growing understanding of Parkinson's pathology and clinical experience and has heavily influenced emerging clinical trials. The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study was launched in 2010 with a mission to identify biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease (PD) onset and progression — a critical next step in the development of new and better treatments for PD. PPMI is sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation and funded by the Foundation in partnership with more than 30 biotech and pharmaceutical, non-profit and private funders. PPMI is recruiting people with and without Parkinson's disease. Get started today . At PPMI's 50 clinical sites in 12 countries, over 2,000 participants have contributed data and biosamples to the most robust Parkinson's database and specimen bank ever created. The study has applied deep molecular profiling techniques to generate data from whole genome and epigenome sequencing and transcriptomics, for example. This comprehensive, standardized, longitudinal PD data and biological sample repository is paired with a simple online system that allows researchers to access study data and samples for complementary PD research in their own labs across the globe. PPMI data has been downloaded more than 6 million times, and the study has received more than 200 biospecimen requests.

View list of PPMI publications. Standardization and Collaboration: The biosample collection, storage and analysis methods pioneered by PPMI have been adopted by successive Parkinson's studies. These standards allow for analysis and comparison across studies, which is the basis of large-scale collaborations to advance understanding and treatment of Parkinson's. One such collaboration is the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's disease (AMP PD) program , led by the National Institutes of Health. MJFF and PPMI are partners in AMP PD. Trial Design: In addition to adopting PPMI biosample handling methods, companies testing new Parkinson's therapies are looking to PPMI for other protocol details. Many have modeled inclusion criteria for early de novo Parkinson's (such as positive DaTscan) after PPMI, and the study's successful recruitment and retention of volunteers — including genetic mutation carriers — for a long, intensive study have lent confidence to study sponsors.

We need your help--consider participating in a research study.  Dozens of researchers around the country are actively recruiting for Parkinson's research studies, including in-person and virtual opportunities. Participants both with PD and without are encouraged to apply. Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) The Michael J. Fox Foundation launched PPMI in 2010 to better understand Parkinson's and advance new treatments. Since then, the study has changed how research is done and what scientists know about the brain. It is a cornerstone of our understanding of disease and has heavily influenced clinical trials. Today, with more therapies in testing, PPMI is expanding. The study has added an online platform to gather data from more than 100,000 people. It is following volunteers at more sites in more countries. More data can help advance us closer to better treatments and prevention. Join the study that could change everything.

With an unbiased expert perspective and a global network of contacts, our wide-ranging view of the field lets us collaborate to solve complex problems that require different talents and target resources where they are needed most — to pay off for patients faster. It is accepted practice among private disease research funders that the most important decisions — how to allocate donor-raised dollars — are made by external scientific advisors and boards. We bucked this model from day one in favor of building an in-house team of formally trained PhDs and business-trained project managers. We’re on a mission to meet every person with Parkinson’s online or face to face. We're committed to connecting patients and families to the robust nationwide PD community. By participating in clinical trials, advocating for Parkinson's policy or engaging in our community and Team Fox events, they are helping us carry new therapies over the goal line.

A Letter from Michael J. Fox and Debi Brooks Dear Friend, As we write this letter, it’s been well over a year since the world came to a standstill, and it finally feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We’re marveling at what has just been learned, or re-learned, about the power of science. PPMI: A Landmark Study Takes Pioneering Steps toward Prevention The Michael J. Fox Foundation’s landmark clinical study, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative , is entering an ambitious new phase: expanding to study the largest group of individuals ever assembled who are at risk for Parkinson’s, but in whom symptoms have not yet appeared. Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP): Positioning the Field for a Seismic Shift 2019 marked the launch of ASAP, a coordinated research initiative to advance targeted basic research for Parkinson’s disease. The initiative builds on the significant strides made by the research community, funders, other experts and strategists around the world.

The Foundation works to educate and engage audiences at scale to drive participation in our community. Momentum in Therapeutic Development When MJFF was founded, the Parkinson’s drug development pipeline was sparse, with few companies willing to invest in Parkinson’s research. Today, there is greater clinical activity than ever before. The pipeline of potential therapies continues to grow and diversify, with more than 200 potential treatments for Parkinson’s in clinical trials and more on the way. 2019 + 2020 in Photos For more photos, please view our full Annual Report online. 2019  and 2020 #TogetherAtHome Photos 2019 and 2020 in Advocacy Photos 2019 and 2020 in Team Fox Photos Photo Gallery Michael J.

Fox and Debi Brooks  Dear Friend, As we write this letter, it’s been well over a year since the world came to a standstill, and it finally feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We’re marveling at what has just been learned, or re-learned, about the power of science. Over the past 18 months biomedical research became a household topic (who could ever have predicted that mRNA would be the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” video short?), and people all over the world banded together to come up with an answer to an urgent health need. That need manifested itself in a real desire and energy to create a success story for the ages. And yet, if you’re reading this, you know only too well that it’s easier said than done. With your aid and partnership, the Foundation has been at it in Parkinson’s disease for 20 years and a billion dollars’ worth of research. But that's what it takes. Our thought never has been how are we going to do it, or what's it going to be like? Just: We're going to do it. That sounds so simple, one can risk sounding glib. Even inveterate optimists like the two of us are sober about ending a disease as complex as Parkinson’s. Still, seeing the development of the COVID vaccine in record time has only stoked our passion, and, we hope, yours. That sounds so simple, one can risk sounding glib.

Around the globe, thousands of researchers are now our partners in exploring the molecular underpinnings of Parkinson’s toxicity with hundreds of teams executing rational strategies for short-circuiting cellular “bad actors.” They are eager to apply for our funding, download our rigorously characterized data sets, test new agents using our wide and affordable range of preclinical disease models, lift and leverage our published protocols to rapidly stand up new clinical trials, and engage our robust audience of people and families living with Parkinson’s.

If we try to put ourselves back where we were when we started, it was impossible to know how far and how fast the Foundation would come. We knew there was unplumbed scientific opportunity, and we were confident in our novel approach to unlock that potential. What's clear now is that, in dialogue with the community, we've been able to tap into something new. For 20 years now, we've been listening to researchers’ and patients’ needs alike, articulating and envisioning the missing pieces, and then filling the most important gaps.

What's clear now is that, in dialogue with the community, we've been able to tap into something new. For 20 years now, we've been listening to researchers’ and patients’ needs alike, articulating and envisioning the missing pieces, and then filling the most important gaps. We’re thankful for you — everyone who has felt the power of this vision and been compelled to get involved. The combination of opportunity in science and the funding we've been able to galvanize through the generosity of so many people is magic. Bringing those things together has transformed the field from where it was. We’re thankful for you — everyone who has felt the power of this vision and been compelled to get involved.

This Annual Report, a special edition covering 2019 and 2020, recognizes the individuals, foundations and companies that have honored us with significant contributions over the past two years. But, like everything else in 2020, our modest plans to mark our 20th year and $1-billion-funded mark were disrupted by COVID-19. So this report also pays tribute to some of the milestone events of these two remarkable years.

Even in the face of the tremendous disruptions of the global pandemic, we have worked to honor your commitment by spending the last 18 months pivoting to maintain momentum in Parkinson’s science. That meant being flexible and responsive to scientists’ needs in the face of a wide range of changes in both academic and industry settings. We remain proud of our track record of efficiency, with 88 cents of every dollar spent going straight to research. And we are so grateful to have had this opportunity to deepen our connection with you, our courageous Parkinson’s community, through such a challenging time.

Fox Founder Deborah W. Brooks CEO and Co-Founder  Close A Letter from Michael J. Fox and Debi Brooks  Dear Friend, As we write this letter, it’s been well over a year since the world came to a standstill, and it finally feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We’re marveling at what has just been learned, or re-learned, about the power of science. Over the past 18 months biomedical research became a household topic (who could ever have predicted that mRNA would be the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” video short?), and people all over the world banded together to come up with an answer to an urgent health need. That need manifested itself in a real desire and energy to create a success story for the ages. And yet, if you’re reading this, you know only too well that it’s easier said than done. With your aid and partnership, the Foundation has been at it in Parkinson’s disease for 20 years and a billion dollars’ worth of research. But that's what it takes. Our thought never has been how are we going to do it, or what's it going to be like? Just: We're going to do it. That sounds so simple, one can risk sounding glib. Even inveterate optimists like the two of us are sober about ending a disease as complex as Parkinson’s. Still, seeing the development of the COVID vaccine in record time has only stoked our passion, and, we hope, yours. That sounds so simple, one can risk sounding glib.

Around the globe, thousands of researchers are now our partners in exploring the molecular underpinnings of Parkinson’s toxicity with hundreds of teams executing rational strategies for short-circuiting cellular “bad actors.” They are eager to apply for our funding, download our rigorously characterized data sets, test new agents using our wide and affordable range of preclinical disease models, lift and leverage our published protocols to rapidly stand up new clinical trials, and engage our robust audience of people and families living with Parkinson’s.

In 2016, the NNCSS was enacted and signed into law; and, in 2018 the CDC began work to establish the NNCSS, embarking first on a two-year pilot with Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis with the ultimate goal of expanding the system to all neurological diseases and conditions.

This knowledge could lead to better treatment and care options for people living with Parkinson’s and pave the way for prevention strategies.” “The data collected by the NNCSS could significantly benefit both researchers and patients,” said MJFF CEO Todd Sherer. “Having nationwide data on people with Parkinson’s will provide researchers with a new understanding of the demographics of this disease and whether some clusters are associates with exposure to pesticides and herbicides.

This is the first step in what will scale into a much larger effort that could eventually expand to include additional neurological diseases and conditions. Beginning with Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis, the CDC’s goal is to build this initiative in the most cost-effective way, allowing them to take advantage of electronic health records to compile population-based data on neurological diseases.

Following the meeting, Thompson noted: “Partnerships and engagement with the federal government is critical, and working with the CDC on this important initiative, along with MJFF’s partnership with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and industry partners on the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Parkinson’s disease , leverages knowledge and resources to advance Parkinson’s research.” Following the meeting, Thompson noted: “Partnerships and engagement with the federal government is critical, and working with the CDC on this important initiative, along with MJFF’s partnership with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and industry partners on the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Parkinson’s disease , leverages knowledge and resources to advance Parkinson’s research.” Following the meeting, Thompson noted: “Partnerships and engagement with the federal government is critical, and working with the CDC on this important initiative, along with MJFF’s partnership with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and industry partners on the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Parkinson’s disease , leverages knowledge and resources to advance Parkinson’s research.” Following the meeting, Thompson noted: “Partnerships and engagement with the federal government is critical, and working with the CDC on this important initiative, along with MJFF’s partnership with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and industry partners on the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Parkinson’s disease , leverages knowledge and resources to advance Parkinson’s research.” What’s next for the NNCSS initiative? As the data collection and analysis efforts move forward, Thompson and MJFF’s staff will participate in a listening session in early November; there, the CDC will meet with representatives from other neurological disease advocacy groups to learn about their needs for such a surveillance system and update the community on the status of the pilot project.

Better understanding of the complex genetic, environmental, aging and other factors that lead to Parkinson's would be game-changing in our pursuit of preventive and therapeutic treatment options. Causes of Parkinson's Disease After a Parkinson's diagnosis, people often ask "Why?" For most people, the cause of Parkinson's is unknown ("idiopathic"). Researchers believe that Parkinson's is caused by a combination of factors . If a continuum existed, with genetic causes at one end and environmental causes at the other, people with Parkinson's would fall at many different places. Some cases may be due more to genetics, and others more influenced by environmental factors. We know aging plays a role, too. Scientists are working hard to understand the triggers and the cascade of cellular changes that lead to Parkinson's. Knowing more about the cause could help researchers develop treatments to stop or even prevent the disease. Genetics There is a genetic component to Parkinson's , with researchers estimating that about 30 percent of Parkinson’s risk is explained by genetics. Less than 10 percent of this risk has been explained by known genetic links, which suggests that more Parkinson's genes have yet to be discovered. In the past 10 years, researchers have identified a handful of causal Parkinson's genes ( GBA, LRRK2, PRKN, SNCA ), where genetic mutations greatly increase one's risk. Because n ot everyone who carries these genetic mutations will get Parkinson's , other factors must play a role. The study of genetics, though, gives scientists a starting point to better understand the disease.  Environment Other factors have also been associated with an increased chance of developing Parkinson's disease . These include head injury and exposure to pesticides. As well, in the early 1980s, a group of heroin users in California developed a form of Parkinson's after taking drugs contaminated with a toxin called MPTP. Several studies have linked smoking and caffeine consumption to lower rates of Parkinson's disease. While we do not recommend smoking to prevent Parkinson's, understanding these connections can help guide research into the mechanisms and treatment of the disease. Aging Age is the greatest risk factor for Parkinson's disease . Due to an aging population, researchers project the number of people with Parkinson's will double by 2040. Scientists believe our cells may be more susceptible to damage as they age. In addition, over time the expression of our genes may change, which could set off a chain of cellular events that leads to Parkinson's disease. Combination of Factors Genetics, environment and aging interact to cause disease. Not everyone with a genetic mutation linked to Parkinson's will develop the disease. Similarly, not everyone exposed to a pesticide will be diagnosed. Research into these different triggers continues aggressively every day. The Michael J. Fox Foundation is funding programs to investigate the role of these three factors in the development of Parkinson's. Scientists are also looking at the biological changes (inflammation and cellular stress, for example) associated with these causes and their connections. Greater understanding of the causes of this disease can lead to treatments that would slow, stop or even prevent it.

Some are hard for even doctors to detect. Others are obvious even to an untrained eye. Visit a movement disorder specialist if you think you're experiencing Parkinson's symptoms. Motor Symptoms People are usually more familiar with the motor (movement) symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). These signs are noticeable from the outside and are used by doctors to make a diagnosis. The three "cardinal" motor symptoms of PD are: Stiffness (rigidity): muscle stiffness detected by a doctor on examination Slowness (bradykinesia): decrease in spontaneous and voluntary movement; may include slower walking, less arm swinging while walking, or decreased blinking or facial expression Resting tremor : a rhythmic, involuntary shaking that occurs in a finger, hand or limb when it's relaxed and disappears during voluntary movement Not everyone with Parkinson's experiences all three motor symptoms, but slowness always is present. And although tremor is the most common symptom at diagnosis, not everyone with Parkinson's has tremor . Other motor symptoms — walking problems or difficulty with balance and coordination — also may occur. These can happen any time in the course of Parkinson's, but are more likely as the disease advances. Non Motor Symptoms Non motor (non-movement) symptoms sometimes are called the "invisible" symptoms of Parkinson's because you can't see them from the outside. These common symptoms can affect almost every body system, occur any time in the course of disease (even before motor symptoms or diagnosis) and differ in severity from person to person. Non motor symptoms can significantly impact quality of life for people with Parkinson's and their families. They may include: Autonomic Dysfunction Parkinson's can affect the automatic/involuntary functions that our bodies perform. Constipation : decreased or difficult-to-pass bowel movements Read more about Constipation  Low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension): decrease in blood pressure when changing positions, such as standing from sitting, which can cause lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting Read more about Low Blood Pressure  Sexual problems : erectile dysfunction in men; decreased libido or pain in women Learn more about Sexual Changes  Sweating problems : excessive perspiration, even when not hot or anxious Urine problems : frequent urination, involuntary loss of urine (incontinence) or difficulty emptying the bladder (weak stream) Mood and Thinking Changes Parkinson's disease can impact how you feel and think. Apathy : lack of motivation and interest in activities Memory or thinking (cognitive) problems : vary widely; range from multitasking and concentration difficulties that don’t interfere with daily activities (mild cognitive impairment) to significant problems that impact a job and daily and social activities (dementia) Read more about Memory & Thinking Problems  Mood disturbances : depression (sadness, loss of energy, decreased interest in activities) and anxiety (uncontrollable worry) Read more about Depression & Anxiety  Hallucinations & delusions : seeing things that aren't there (visual hallucinations) and having false, often paranoid, beliefs (delusions), such as that a spouse is being unfaithful or money is being stolen Read more about Hallucinations & Delusions  Other Physical Changes Parkinson's can cause other difficulties, as well. Drooling : build up of saliva because of decreased swallowing Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue : feeling drowsy, sluggish or exhausted; may be symptoms on their own or result from Parkinson's medications Learn more about Fatigue  Pain : discomfort in one body part or the entire body Skin changes : oily or dry skin; increased risk of melanoma Sleep problems : insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep), restless legs syndrome (an uncomfortable sensation in the legs that goes away with moving them) or REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams) Read more about Sleep Changes  Smell loss : decreased ability to detect odors Read more about Smell Loss  Speech problems : speaking in a soft and monotone voice and sometimes slurring words or mumbling Read more about Speech Problems  Swallowing problems : choking, coughing and clearing the throat when eating and drinking Read more about Swallowing Problems  Vision changes : dry eyes, double vision and trouble reading Weight changes : mild to moderate weight loss may occur in some people Talk to your doctor if you're experiencing these symptoms, especially if they are interfering with activities you want or need to do. For example, slowness of movement might make exercise more challenging or fatigue might make your workday less productive. Keep in mind that even if you have symptoms common among people with Parkinson's, they may be brought on by a completely different condition altogether.

This initiative, announced in 2019, builds on the significant strides made by the research community, funders, other experts and strategists around the world. With input across sectors and disciplines, ASAP has developed a strategic roadmap to collectively tackle field-wide challenges: Support meaningful, multidisciplinary collaboration Generate research-enabling resources Democratize data Led by Nobel Laureate Dr. Randy Schekman and Dr. Ekemini Riley, ASAP is working with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to implement its programs. ASAP is managed by the Coalition for Aligning Science . The initiative was incubated at the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy with support from the Sergey Brin Family Foundation. Visit www.parkinsonsroadmap.org to read more on the history and vision of the ASAP initiative. Read more in ASAP's Blueprint for Collaborative Open Science .

Riley, PhD Managing Director, ASAP Read Bio Ekemini A. U. Riley, PhD Managing Director, ASAP  Sonya Dumanis, PhD Deputy Director, ASAP Read Bio Sonya Dumanis, PhD Deputy Director, ASAP  The ASAP initiative’s investment in basic research is positioning the field for a seismic shift in understanding of Parkinson’s onset and progression. MJFF is designing our research strategy to complement ASAP programs with continued funding across the development pipeline, from basic discovery work through clinical trials and post-market analysis. For our latest RFAs, visit our Funding Opportunities page . ASAP Implementation Partner In parallel, we are working with ASAP as its implementation partner and have been involved since the initiative’s inception. The scientific community’s recognition and trust of The Michael J. Fox Foundation as a research partner is an invaluable asset in scaffolding these programs and building toward our shared goals. – Randy Schekman, PhD, ASAP Chair of Scientific Advisory Board ASAP has leveraged our grantmaking infrastructure to accept and review proposals and to issue grants to its Collaborative Research Network and its Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program (GP2) . In addition, MJFF staff provides business operations support such as coordinating and managing resource acquisitions and data sharing. Through our partnership, ASAP has also signed on to other consortia that count MJFF as a partner. ASAP is now a member of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) program managed by FNIH (the Foundation for the NIH) and uniting government, industry and non-profits to support biomarker and target discovery work. (MJFF is a founding member.) And ASAP is partnering in our landmark study, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) . ASAP support is allowing PPMI to significantly expand its enrollment — bringing together a larger and more diverse group of individuals to increase understanding around how Parkinson's develops and changes over time. A tenet of the ASAP strategy is research-enabling resources, and the initiative is supporting large-scale programs to build and share a variety of tools. Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program (GP2) GP2 is an ambitious five-year program to genotype >150,000 volunteers around the world to further understand the genetic architecture of Parkinson’s disease. Underlying data, analytical processes, and results from GP2 will be made available to the research community as quickly as possible, with minimal barriers to access and use. Read More on GP2 Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) ASAP has devoted significant support to our longitudinal PPMI study and has joined the PPMI steering committee to direct the future of this valued resource. PPMI aims to enroll more than 4,000 participants across a variety of cohorts including many with Parkinson’s risk factors who may help learn about how to predict, detect and stop the disease at its earliest stages. All PPMI data is de-identified and open to the researcher community (in addition to available biosamples). Read More on PPMI ASAP is funding multidisciplinary research teams to form the ASAP Collaborative Research Network (CRN), which will address key knowledge gaps in the basic mechanisms that contribute to Parkinson’s development and progression. All data resulting from this funded work will be made available to the scientific community at large at the earliest opportunity. Read more on the ASAP CRN.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of research integrity and scientific rigor. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and public charity, we take the following steps to assure that all MJFF-funded research adheres to strict ethical guidelines and transparent practices. Grant Funding and Peer-review Process All investigator-initiated grants awarded by our Foundation undergo a rigorous peer-review process. Continued funding is contingent upon the achievement of predefined milestones. Data associated with milestones are assessed by internal and external scientists. The Foundation also requires submission of standard ethical approvals and related documentation for all funded projects. These processes strive to ensure that only ethically conducted and highly promising research receives support. Research Conduct and Transparency Recipients of funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation are required to adhere to our open access publication policy. This policy mandates that all research results be broadly disseminated and accessible to the global research community for replication and further study. By enforcing these standards, we aim to foster an environment of transparency and accountability in the scientific community. Addressing Research Misconduct When issues of research misconduct arise, they typically are investigated by a researcher’s home institution. In such cases, the Foundation cooperates fully as requested and requires that results of the investigation be disclosed to us in a timely manner in case further action is required on our part. We remain committed to supporting ethical research practices and ensuring that our funded projects contribute to the advancement of Parkinson’s disease research. Conflict of Interest To ensure fairness, MJFF has instituted formal conflict-of-interest policies to ensure that our scientific staff and external reviewers evaluate grant applications impartially. If a reviewer has any personal or financial interest in a proposal, they are excluded from reviewing it. This includes situations where the reviewer is involved in the project, has a financial stake, or has any other personal or professional relationship that could affect their objectivity. Reviewers with such conflicts do not participate in discussions or scoring of the proposal, and they see the review results only after the process is complete. Continual Improvement We continually review and improve our policies and procedures to safeguard the integrity of the research we fund. Our goal is to maintain the trust of the Parkinson’s community and to support research that holds the potential to improve the lives of those affected by the disease.

Government to Prioritize Preventing and Curing Parkinson’s With the leadership of the federal government, a country-wide strategy dedicated to ending Parkinson’s disease has the potential to: Dramatically increase federal research funding Develop more effective pathways for treatments and cures Improve early diagnosis Spark new and improved models for patient care Create standards and measures to prevent Parkinson’s disease Address health disparities in diagnosis, treatment and clinical trial participation Enhance public awareness of the disease Scientists have achieved game-changing breakthroughs in understanding Parkinson’s biology over the past year — including the discovery of a biomarker — bringing unprecedented clarity to where collaboration can be most effective and yield the fastest gains. Government coordination, investment and attention capitalizing on this moment can do more than ever before to accelerate and bring to market a cure for Parkinson’s disease — and, ultimately, prevent it altogether. This effort also paves the way for international collaboration to speed the global search for cures.

Next Steps for the National Parkinson’s Project The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with developing and maintaining the National Parkinson’s Project and a supporting advisory council. This process will require input and planning support from government agencies and other stakeholders, including The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF). Congress will be responsible for ensuring that HHS carries out this initiative. MJFF’s Public Policy team will develop ongoing opportunities for advocates to urge Congress and HHS to effectively implement and resource the Project.

When we started the Foundation, we could only dream of the breakthroughs the Parkinson’s community has experienced over the last year, from the discovery of a biomarker to the federal government advancing a plan to end Parkinson’s. I’m endlessly thankful to everyone who has carried the load to get us here. Michael J. Fox Michael J. Fox Founder Advisory Council to Play Key Role in Evaluating Progress HHS will create an Advisory Council on Parkinson’s Research, Care and Services to: evaluate the implementation and outcomes of the National Parkinson’s Project; advise the Secretary of HHS on Parkinson’s-related issues and provide recommendations for preventing, diagnosing, treating and curing Parkinson’s disease. Each year, the council will provide a report to Congress and the Secretary of HHS that contains evaluations of all federally funded programs related to Parkinson’s as well as recommendations to improve health outcomes, limit exposures to environmental risk factors for Parkinson’s and reduce the financial burden on patients and the federal government. The public-private advisory council has not yet been appointed but will comprise members of federal agencies, people living with Parkinson’s, care partners, researchers, clinicians and other experts. While MJFF looks forward to supporting HHS as they select experts from the Parkinson’s community to serve on the council, it will ultimately be up to the Secretary of HHS to determine who will be appointed to those seats. The council will be co-chaired by Walter J. Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health and David Goldstein, MS, Associate Deputy Director for the Office of Science and Medicine at HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.

Extraordinary Nationwide Advocacy Effort Gets Results To make this initiative possible, hundreds of thousands of patients, families and advocates participated in MJFF's advocacy campaigns to urge Congress to support and pass the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act . You signed our petitions; used our digital forms to send letters and make calls; joined us for virtual meetings with your congressional leaders; took our advocacy trainings; spread the word on social media and in opinion articles and more. In the end, 215 total senators and representatives co-sponsored the legislation, which was ultimately passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers and signed into law in July 2024. This law and its resulting initiative are modeled after the successful National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA), signed into law in 2011. According to the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement, NAPA has resulted in “unprecedented federal research funding increases, initiated development of crucial public health infrastructure and improved access to quality care.” The federal government now invests $3.8 billion in Alzheimer’s and dementia research annually, a seven-fold increase since NAPA became law.

In the legislation, Congress indicates it would like to increase the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget by $2 billion over the next two years (though further legislative action is needed before the NIH receives these funds). On top of this provision to advance investments in medical research, the spending bill also includes several measures to expand access to health care services. Elimination of the Cap on Medicare Therapy Services. Of particular note to the Parkinson's disease (PD) community is the removal of the Medicare therapy cap, which limited the amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy a beneficiary could receive. Previously, Congress created an exceptions process that allowed individuals to access therapy above the cap if the services were deemed medically necessary, but this process needed to be renewed by lawmakers every few years, creating uncertainty and the potential for coverage denials. The new spending bill makes this exceptions process permanent, meaning people on Medicare can no longer be denied therapy if they need it to manage their health conditions. The Parkinson's community advocated for many years to eliminate this cap and increase access to these important services. Recently, The Michael J. Fox Foundation and other patient groups called on Congress to address this issue . Thank you to every member of our community who took action on this critical issue; the new law represents an important advocacy achievement for people with PD. Closure of the Medicare Part D "Donut Hole." Once beneficiaries and their Medicare drug plan have spent a certain amount of money (set annually by Medicare) for covered medications, beneficiaries are responsible for a higher portion of their out-of-pocket drug costs, up to a certain point. This coverage gap is called the Medicare "donut hole." Previous law said the donut hole must be eliminated in 2020; the new spending bill moves this date to 2019. Expansion of Telemedicine under Medicare. Several measures in the new spending legislation boost access to telemedicine, including one that expands traditional Medicare coverage for these services. Another provision will increase telemedicine coverage for Medicare Advantage enrollees with chronic health conditions, including Parkinson's. Repeal of Automatic Cuts to Medicare. A provision within the Affordable Care Act would have triggered automatic cuts to Medicare if the program's spending reached a certain amount. An unelected board (referred to as the Independent Payment Advisory Board) would have been in charge of making these cuts, and the likely result would have been fewer providers accepting individuals on Medicare. The new spending bill repeals this provision, preventing arbitrary cuts to a program many individuals rely on for their health care needs. People with Parkinson's and their loved ones took action on this issue in May 2017, sending emails to legislators asking them to prevent the cuts from taking place . Thank you for speaking up on this topic and helping elected officials understand why adequate funding for Medicare is so important to our community.

Right now, more research is needed to better understand if cannabis (including marijuana and CBD products) could treat Parkinson’s disease. Restrictions, including marijuana’s status as a Schedule I controlled substance, have blocked robust research into its potential therapeutic benefits for Parkinson’s. Removing these barriers to research will allow scientists to determine if medical cannabis may safely and effectively help people manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s.

Earlier this year, MJFF staff members Andrew Koemeter-Cox, PhD, and Ted Thompson attended the Medical Marijuana in Parkinson’s Disease Conference in Denver. The consensus was that much more research is needed to understand the potential benefits and uses of medical cannabis. While patients report that various kinds of medical cannabis help with their symptoms, there is very little research evidence available to support this.

While patients Andrew Koemeter-Cox, MJFF’s associate director of research programs, explains: “Current policies hinder comprehensive medical research on cannabis, making it difficult to generate the evidence needed for clear recommendations. This is especially problematic when some products may be unsafe for human use and have the potential for adverse interactions with other medications.” Andrew Koemeter-Cox, MJFF’s associate director of research programs, explains: “Current policies hinder comprehensive medical research on cannabis, making it difficult to generate the evidence needed for clear recommendations.

This is a positive development, and we are hopeful that it will create momentum on legislative and other regulatory fronts for improved access for research purposes.

When it comes to policy and advocacy, it's critical that the Parkinson's community speaks with one voice. For this reason, The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) created the Unified Parkinson’s Advocacy Council (UPAC). Comprising local, state, regional and national Parkinson's organizations, UPAC represents the priorities of Parkinson's patients, family members and care partners on Capitol Hill and in state houses across the country. UPAC sends letters to policymakers when relevant bills or federal rules are being debated and encourages Parkinson's constituencies across the country to advocate. UPAC's approach follows the work of the Parkinson’s Action Network (PAN). From 1991 to 2016, PAN served as the unified voice of the Parkinson’s community on public policy and advocacy issues. PAN represented patients and loved ones on Capitol Hill and worked, with input from other Parkinson’s organizations, to positively impact research and health care policy. In June 2016, PAN closed its doors and transitioned key staff and programs to MJFF. UPAC members include: American Parkinson Disease Association Brian Grant Foundation CurePSP Dallas Area Parkinson Society Davis Phinney Foundation Friends of Parkinson's Hawai'i Parkinson Association Houston Area Parkinson Society Lewy Body Dementia Association Life Spark Jewish Center for Parkinson's Michigan Parkinson Foundation Mission MSA Northwest Parkinson's Foundation Parkinson & Movement Disorder Alliance Parkinson Association of Alabama Parkinson Association of Central Florida Parkinson Association of Northern California Parkinson Association of the Carolinas Parkinson Association of the Rockies Parkinson Support Center of Northern Nevada Parkinson Voice Project Parkinson's Foundation Parkinson's Foundation Western Pennsylvania Parkinson's Resources of Oregon PD Avengers Power for Parkinson's Power Over Parkinson's The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research Wisconsin Parkinson Association Public Policy Matters Your voice and personal story can shape policymakers' decisions on issues of importance to the Parkinson's community.

The Michael J. Fox Foundation is building on this momentum to explore prevention of the disease and transform diagnosis and treatments. Years of work spent uncovering Parkinson’s secrets — defining the highly variable patient experience, shedding light on genetic origins of disease, mapping molecular pathways — are now paying off in a tangible quickening tempo of scientific progress. Investigators are increasingly linking cellular pathology to outward clinical symptoms (and vice versa) to identify new therapeutic and biomarker targets. This has positioned drug makers to make rapid inroads toward treatments that have the potential to slow or stop progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The field also is closer than ever to arriving at therapies that can treat all the symptoms of PD, including the less well understood non-motor aspects, such as cognitive impairment and mood disorders, sleeping and digestive issues, and speech and swallowing difficulties. While the Parkinson's pipeline is more active than at any previous point in the modern era of drug development, much work remains to be done in the quest to better understand the connection between pathological "bad actors" and the daily lived experience of the disease — and to translate understanding of basic Parkinson's biology into new therapies. Parkinson's Disease Understanding In stark contrast to the Parkinson's research field of just a few years ago, several therapies — mostly due to increased understanding of Parkinson's genetics — are now in clinical trials. While therapies based on genetic understanding may benefit the broad disease population over time, early clinical trials are taking a precision-medicine approach, recruiting participants based on individual biology. Scientists believe the following approaches are currently closest to translation into practical therapies that may slow or stop Parkinson’s disease — something no current therapy has been demonstrated to do: GBA mutations, also linked to Gaucher disease, are the most common genetic cause of PD yet discovered, accounting for five to 15 percent of all Parkinson’s cases, depending on ethnicity. Counteracting the dysfunction associated with GBA mutations — lowered activity of the glucocerebrosidase (GCase) protein — could slow or stop progression of Parkinson’s disease. The genetic target LRRK2 has been the focus of intense investigation by PD researchers since its discovery in 2004. The first in-human trials of LRRK2 inhibitors started in 2017. Work is ongoing to provide insight into unknown aspects of LRRK2 biology and better target experimental therapies against it. A universal feature of Parkinson’s is aggregation, or clumping, of the protein alpha-synuclein in the brains and body cells of people with the disease (similar to the amyloid clumps seen in Alzheimer’s disease). Multiple drug companies are conducting clinical trials to try to prevent or break up synuclein clumps, which scientists believe could stop PD in its tracks. Therapeutic development is expected to accelerate as clinical trials integrate new biomarker testing for this Parkinson's form of alpha-synuclein. Several potentially disease-modifying therapies continue to advance via “repurposing” — scientifically evaluating drugs approved for various conditions for their benefit in PD. Isradipine (a hypertension drug) and inosine (an antioxidant supplement) are now in Phase III trials. The field also has seen promise in the diabetes drug exenatide and the cancer drug nilotinib. The Search for an Objective Test The need for objective Parkinson’s disease tests, or biomarkers (like hypertension in heart disease or blood sugar levels in diabetes), has become more urgent as more projects enter human testing. Objective disease tests would speed drug development by identifying people most likely to respond to treatment, tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic impact. The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is the Foundation’s landmark public-private partnership to identify and validate biomarker candidates and develop tests to selectively and specifically measure Parkinson’s pathology and symptoms. PPMI has become a world model for Parkinson’s study design, lending the field groundbreaking tools and insights such as the use of dopamine scans (DaTscan) as an early PD progression marker, the identification of factors that may predict cognitive decline, and even best practices in how to effectively recruit patients and controls for clinical studies — an ongoing challenge in Parkinson’s research. PPMI played a pivotal role in the breakthrough discovery in 2023 of a biomarker test for Parkinson’s , called the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay. The test makes it possible for the first time to diagnose Parkinson’s biologically, even before symptoms begin. Work is ongoing in pursuit of advanced brain imaging tracers that would allow scientists to visualize key cellular entities in the living brain. A similar tracer has been fundamental to recent progress in Alzheimer's therapeutic development and holds potential to transform diagnosis, track disease and provide therapeutic assessment in people with Parkinson's as well as atypical parkinsonisms such as Lewy body dementia (LBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). From Biology to New Therapies While seven new Parkinson’s drugs have come to market since 2014 — a heartening expansion of treatment options — scientists continue working aggressively on many fronts toward next-generation therapies to greatly improve the treatment and management of motor and non-motor symptoms . These projects require, in tandem, funding, objective biological measures, infrastructure to support recruitment, and coordination with regulators and payers. Several novel formulations of levodopa are currently anticipated to receive regulatory approval in the near future. These include inhaled and transdermal formulations backed and "de-risked" by The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) in early development. An improved delivery of levodopa has been a primary field goal for years, as scientists have searched for a more consistent way to get the drug into the brain. When taken orally, absorption of the traditional oral formulation into the blood and brain can be inconsistent, coming in peaks and valleys, which is believed to lead to motor fluctuations, including disabling “off” periods. While no longer considered the "silver bullet" scientists once hoped, stem cell approaches continue advancing toward therapeutic relevance. Induced pluripotent stem cells (also known as iPS cells — engineered by reprogramming mature adult cells) are expected to one day treat motor symptoms by replacing damaged dopamine cells. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, while already available and appropriate for some patients, remains under active study to expand its benefits to a wider range of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. One ongoing investigation seeks to target brain areas associated with balance problems (unaddressed by current forms of DBS). Another team wants to determine whether DBS can slow symptom progression if administered in earlier stages of disease. Others are working to develop adaptive or “intelligent” DBS — allowing for the continuous optimization of therapy on an individual basis, maximizing motor symptom improvement and minimizing adverse effect, prolonging battery life and reducing the need for battery replacement surgeries.

A subset of the available benefits might include: Medicare Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older. Individuals younger than 65 with certain disabilities also can qualify. The Medicare website lays out several different parts of the program : Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) helps cover inpatient care in hospitals; skilled nursing facility care; hospice care; and home health care. Medicare Part B (medical insurance) helps cover services from doctors and other health care providers; outpatient care; home health care; durable medical equipment; and many preventive services. Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) includes all benefits and services covered under Part A and Part B. It usually includes Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) as part of the plan. It is run by Medicare-approved private insurance companies that follow rules set by Medicare. Plans have a yearly limit on your out-of-pocket costs for medical services. It may include extra benefits and services that aren’t covered under the original Medicare program — sometimes for an extra cost. Medicare Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage) helps cover the cost of prescription drugs. It is run by Medicare-approved drug plans that follow rules set by Medicare. It may help lower prescription drug costs and protect against higher costs in the future. Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) is insurance sold by private companies that can help pay for some of the health care costs that the original Medicare program does not cover. For more information  Social Security In addition to traditional retirement benefits, the Social Security Administration (SSA) also provides benefits to qualifying individuals with disabilities. Options include: Social Security Disability Insurance Program: This program pays benefits to people with disabilities and certain members of their family if the individual has worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Supplemental Security Income: This program pays benefits to adults and children with disabilities who have limited income and resources. For more information on both programs  Medicaid Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health care services primarily to low-income individuals. Among those potentially eligible for coverage are people with disabilities and those who receive federally assisted income maintenance payments, such as Supplemental Security Income. Because state governments contribute a substantial amount of funds to Medicaid, benefits vary widely around the country. Nearly all programs help pay for prescription drugs.

The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is leading the charge toward a world without Parkinson's disease (PD). Since our Foundation's inception, we have operated with one single-minded goal: putting ourselves out of business by finding the cure for Parkinson's. Driven by this admittedly unusual approach, we have designed a milestone-driven, innovative and high-risk model to identify and accelerate those ideas with the greatest potential to solve field-wide problems, accelerate the pace of research and make a tangible impact on patients’ unmet needs. Everything we do is in service of our mission to eradicate Parkinson's altogether. While we will never be satisfied until the cure is found, we take pride in our clear, wide-ranging track record of impact on the Parkinson's research field: In our preclinical portfolio, MJFF-funded investigations have resulted in more than 20 early-stage therapeutic programs, which have attracted follow-on funding from venture capital, pharmaceutical or government funders for continuing development. In our clinical portfolio, we have funded or sponsored scores of clinical trials in partnership with both academic and industry teams. Today, more than 15 disease-modifying interventions are in clinical trials. Multiple improved symptomatic therapies have achieved regulatory approval or are poised to do so. The landmark MJFF-sponsored Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) has built the most robust dataset and biosample library in the history of Parkinson’s research. Data from brain scans (e.g., MRI, DaTscan), biosample analysis (e.g., spinal fluid protein levels) and intensive “omics” investigations (e.g., whole genome and RNA sequencing) from 1,500 volunteers has been downloaded by researchers over 1.7 million times since the study's launch in 2010. PPMI played a pivotal role in the discovery of a breakthrough biomarker test that reveals a key pathology of the disease: abnormal alpha-synuclein. Called the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay, the test can detect Parkinson's pathology in spinal fluid in people who show clinical symptoms of the disease and also in people who have not yet shown symptoms but are at a high risk of developing PD. The Foundation's online clinical study, Fox Insight , has galvanized people with Parkinson's and their families to take an active role in research by sharing their lived experience of the disease. Since the study launched in 2017, more than 48,000 individuals have raised their hand to become citizen scientists to power PD research.   “The Michael J. Fox Foundation has managed to become, in its short life, the most credible voice on Parkinson’s research in the world.” The New York Times  Yet funding alone is not enough to drive the progress that Parkinson's patients need. That's why we work to innovate and implement common-sense strategies to speed promising ideas toward clinical testing, regulatory approval and into patients' hands. These include: Creating and distributing research tools (e.g., preclinical models, antibodies and assays) at cost through direct funding to contract research organizations and field experts. This frees researchers and drug makers from years and millions of dollars devoted to tool-making so they can focus on driving scientific discovery. Assembling consortia to align the field on research priorities, problem-solve seemingly intractable research challenges, and jump-start collaborations to accelerate progress and break down silos around traditional research design. Enabling real-time, open-access sharing of tools and data by qualified researchers worldwide to speed discovery and validation. In addition to making curated and raw data from MJFF-sponsored studies available for immediate download, MJFF provides millions in grants to incentivize projects that make use of Foundation-generated biosamples. Building and connecting a powerful network of multidisciplinary experts through workshops, summits, digital platforms and data challenges, inviting the brightest minds in Parkinson’s and other critical fields (e.g., data science, structural biology, cell biology, cancer biology) to harness their talents for deeper understanding and better treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Nurturing and cultivating the next generation of experts by funding millions of dollars in fellowships for movement disorder specialists and regulatory and data science researchers. Educating patients and families about their vital role in research, and building innovative tools such as Fox Trial Finder and Fox Insight to help them take proactive steps toward participation in studies that urgently need them. The need for therapeutic breakthroughs for our most puzzling neurological diseases will grow only more urgent as our population ages. Over our short history, it has become clear that drug development today requires a new kind of stakeholder: one with the expertise to understand not just science, but the business of science; one with the resources, will and dedication to translate decades of discovery research investments into new treatments. The Michael J. Fox Foundation exists to play this essential, strategic role. Read more in our 2019 + 2020 Annual Report.

On December 14, 2018, a federal judge in the state of Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional. This is not the final ruling in the case, and it will be appealed. The ACA remains in effect at this time. The Department of Health and Human Services will continue to administer and enforce the ACA, and the ruling has no immediate impact on individuals receiving coverage through the health care exchanges. A range of health care provider groups are speaking out against the Attorney General's recent announcement concerning coverage for pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A joint statement from the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Physicians, American Osteopathic Association and American Psychiatric Association reads in part: "As physicians who provide a majority of care to individuals for physical and mental conditions, we can speak clearly that these insurance reforms and protections are essential to ensuring that the more than 130 million Americans, especially the more than 31 million individuals between the ages of 55 and 64, who have at least one pre-existing condition are able to secure affordable health care coverage." On June 7, the Department of Justice announced that it will not defend a key ACA provision that protects people with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage or charged more by insurance companies. People with Parkinson's are by definition living with a pre-existing condition. In some cases, such individuals could lose access to their insurance altogether. This unusual DOJ action comes in response to a lawsuit brought by 20 states, led by the Attorney General of Texas, challenging the constitutionality of the ACA. (The lawsuit specifically focuses on the individual mandate, which is necessary to ensure that health care costs are shared across a wide range of individuals, including those with greater and lesser needs, creating average affordable premiums for most.) In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a constitutionally valid exercise of the government's power to tax. But the Justice Department now claims that this justification is no longer valid, due to changes to the tax code passed by Congress in 2017. If the court accepts this argument, "insurers will be allowed to go back to pricing plans based on health conditions, a change that would in many ways turn back the clock to how individual coverage was sold before the ACA," reports The Wall Street Journal . A court decision could be several months away. Until that point, the provision will likely stay in effect. Stay tuned to the Foundation blog for updates and any relevant action steps.

Scientists have come to realize that, for some, genetics and body composition play a major role in someone’s inability to lose weight. These findings have led doctors and researchers to determine that trouble losing weight can be a medical condition – just like high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. With chronic obesity, your body establishes a ‘set point’ for weight that can be nearly impossible to break with just diet and exercise. This is where medically-assisted weight loss can help break through that unhealthy weight and help establish a new, healthier, set point for body weight. These findings have led to the advancement of medications to treat chronic obesity.

Memray Memray has multiple sclerosis, a potentially disabling autoimmune disease of the brain and central nervous system. Living with multiple sclerosis is a challenge, but Memray finds ways to be positive and optimistic. “It’s important to just live your life now,” Memray said. “Live it and enjoy it.” Grayson When Stephanie and Matt brought their newborn, Grayson, home from the hospital, they knew something wasn’t quite right. Doctors soon diagnosed Grayson with infantile spasms, a rare disease that affects babies in their first year of life. As soon as they heard how much Grayson’s treatment would cost, Stephanie and Matt knew it was out of reach for their family. That’s when they found The Assistance Fund. “Not having to worry about the financial part of it is a huge weight off our shoulders,” Matt said. “We can get as close to normalcy as possible.” Susan For Susan, having access to her primary biliary cholangitis  treatment means she can enjoy her retirement. She stays active, playing pickleball, participating in a book club, and going for walks with her husband, Frank. “The Assistance Fund has really given me the gift of life,” Susan said. Why we're here. Millions of people don’t have access to the medicines they need because they can’t afford them.

No existe una manera única de recorrerlo, y para muchos este es uno de los desafíos más grandes que plantea esta enfermedad. Parkinson 360 es un conjunto de recursos desarrollados por la Fundación Michael J. Fox para las personas y familias que conviven con esta enfermedad. Parkinson 360: Testimonios reales para pacientes y familiares Parkinson 360 es una guía sincera con la que cualquier persona afectada por la enfermedad de Parkinson se puede identificar. Está dirigida a aquellos que fueron diagnosticados y a sus seres queridos. Esperamos que esta guía y esta página web lo inspiren a participar activamente en su cuidado, a encontrar nuevas maneras de involucrarse en la comunidad de la enfermedad de Parkinson y a vivir bien por muchos años más. Voces de los Miembros del Consejo de Pacientes de la Fundación Claudia Garrido-Revilla Claudia Garrido-Revilla fue diagnosticada a los 45 años de edad y desde entonces su misión consiste en ayudar a acelerar una cura. Ella es miembro del Consejo de Pacientes de la Fundación, defensora de la comunidad de Parkinson y participante activa de Fox Trial Finder, la herramienta en línea de MJFF que vincula a voluntarios aptos con ensayos clínicos que requieren participantes. Originaria de Monterrey, México, Claudia ha utilizado su voz para ayudar a los pacientes de la comunidad latina a entender su importante función en la investigación. Hoy en día, Claudia vive en Peoria, Illinois, con su esposo y sus dos hijos. “Estoy aquí para erradicar la enfermedad de Parkinson. No existen imposibles, pero necesitamos seguir trabajando. La cura no va caer del cielo.” María L. De León La Dra. María de León, de Nacogdoches, Texas, es miembro del Consejo de Pacientes de la Fundación y una persona que ha vivido con Parkinson desde los 38 años de edad, además, ella misma es especialista del Parkinson, aunque ya está retirada. Durante la última década, María ha dedicado la mayor parte de su tiempo a defender los problemas de las mujeres y establecer un terreno para la comprensión de las diferencias de género en las enfermedades neurológicas, en particular lo correspondiente a la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP); al tiempo que intenta disminuir la disparidad en el tratamiento de la salud entre las minorías. “Como una mujer Mexicana y Americana, entiendo que la comunidad hispana a veces enfrenta barreras lingüísticas. Es importante que los médicos no solo traduzcan materiales, sino que entiendan las experiencias, las culturas y los sistemas de creencias para potenciar el diálogo con los pacientes.” Sebastian Krys Sebastian Krys, miembro del Consejo de Pacientes de la Fundación, fue diagnosticado con la enfermedad de Parkinson a los 48 años de edad. Sebastian, originalmente de Argentina, ha trabajado con algunos de los nombres más importantes de la música: Gloria Estefan, Shakira, Alejandro Sanz, Elvis Costello, por nombrar algunos. El productor e ingeniero ha participado en más de 300 álbunes, y a recibido 12 Grammys Latinos y seis Grammys. Sebastian es un miembro activo de Team Fox, grupo dedicado a recaudar fondos y concientizar sobre la investigación del Parkinson. “En nuestra comunidad, no es algo de lo que se oye hablar mucho. Pero prácticamente todo el mundo conoce a alguien con Parkinson. Esperemos que al hablar públicamente sobre esta enfermedad ayude a eliminar parte del estigma asociado con ella y ayude a financiar la educación, la investigación y el tratamiento para todos los que la necesitamos.” Siete principios para vivir con la enfermedad de Parkinson No existe una descripción universal de la enfermedad de Parkinson. Sus síntomas y la evolución de la enfermedad no serán como los de los demás. Controle su propia enfermedad de Parkinson, instrúyase sobre el tema y conviértase en un experto sobre usted mismo. No existe una descripción universal de la enfermedad de Parkinson. Sus síntomas y la evolución de la enfermedad no serán como los de los demás. Controle su propia enfermedad de Parkinson, instrúyase sobre el tema y conviértase en un experto sobre usted mismo. Mantenerse aislado puede empeorar los síntomas. No es necesario que afronte la enfermedad solo. Si adopta un enfoque en equipo que cuente con un especialista en trastornos del movimiento y con profesionales relacionados con el cuidado de la salud puede mantenerse física y emocionalmente fuerte. Manténgase en contacto con sus seres queridos y evalúe la posibilidad de unirse a un grupo de apoyo. Mantenerse aislado puede empeorar los síntomas. No es necesario que afronte la enfermedad solo.

Manténgase en contacto con sus seres queridos y evalúe la posibilidad de unirse a un grupo de apoyo. No se conforme. La enfermedad de Parkinson varía al igual que las opciones de tratamiento. Diseñar un régimen de medicamentos con el que se sienta cómodo y que sea efectivo para usted llevará tiempo y, es posible, que tenga que probar con varios. Continúe trabajando con su médico y equipo de cuidado hasta encontrar uno. Realice cambios para adaptarse a la evolución de la enfermedad, según sean necesarios. No se conforme.

Lo último en materia de investigación nos trae esperanza, pero como convivimos en un entorno de información constante, debemos aprender a interpretar las noticias científicas. Busque expertos en los que pueda confiar, manténgase actualizado a través de fuentes fidedignas e ignore todo lo demás. Si se informa correctamente, podrá vivir más tranquilo.

La enfermedad de Parkinson es una enfermedad cambiante. Puede tener días, semanas y meses buenos, incluso en tiempos difíciles. La actividad física, la alimentación saludable, la vida social y los pasatiempos influyen de manera positiva en la manera de cursar la enfermedad.

Asegúrese de que sus familiares comprendan cuáles son los cuidados para el final de la vida que desea, deje su testamento y herencia en orden. Si bien estos temas son complejos de hablar, es mejor hacerlo al principio para que todo sea más sencillo a medida que la enfermedad avanza. Prepárese.

The Foundation does not stockpile funds in an endowment, choosing instead to identify the most promising Parkinson's disease research worldwide and commit resources to it as fast as possible. Furthermore, thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 100% of Team Fox proceeds will go directly to research programs. What percentage of my donation goes to Parkinson's research? The Michael J. Fox Foundation strives to make every dollar count as we seek a cure for Parkinson's disease. We keep a sharp eye on expenses.

Clinical trials (also referred to as clinical studies or more broadly as clinical research) are research studies involving human volunteers. The U.S. FDA, and its corollary agencies abroad, requires that a potential therapy be tested extensively in a large group of human volunteers before it can receive approval to be manufactured and made available to patients. All trials and studies on Fox Trial Finder relate to Parkinson's disease. These trials assess the safety and effectiveness of new ways to diagnose, prevent, or treat PD; they also provide insight about the disease process, and how it might be treated. Clinical trials are a vital part of the scientific research process and are essential to developing better treatments for people with Parkinson's. What is a clinical trial?

Clinical trials are a vital part of the scientific research process and are essential to developing better treatments for people with Parkinson's. What types of trials are there? There are two main types of clinical trials: Observational clinical trials do not test drugs or treatments. Researchers observe participants by monitoring their health over a period of time. These studies provide researchers with data that advances our understanding of Parkinson's and how to treat the disease. Interventional clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of a candidate drug, therapy or experimental treatment. What types of trials are there?

Interventional clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of a candidate drug, therapy or experimental treatment. Why is it so important that more people volunteer for trials? Clinical trials and studies play a critical role in the development of new and better therapies. Yet under-enrollment in trials is one of the greatest challenges clinical researchers face. Under-enrollment in trials slows research progress and deters potential funders from investing in research — and we all pay the price in terms of higher costs and longer time horizons to get to therapeutic breakthroughs. Across all diseases, 85 percent of clinical trials finish late due to difficulties enrolling participants and nearly one-third of trials fail to recruit a single subject and cannot ever begin. According to a 2011 ORC Poll commissioned by The Michael J. Fox Foundation, only one in 10 people with Parkinson's participates in trials. In spite of this low participation rate, we know that the Parkinson's community has a significant interest in stepping up to participate in research. The same Harris Poll found that over 85% of PD patients are at least somewhat interested in participating in a trial. Patients site not knowing about specific trial opportunities in their area that need someone like them as the greatest barrier to trial participation. Fox Trial Finder is one solution to help patients and their loved ones act on the intention to get involved in research by making it easier to find trials that are right for them — and letting volunteers know when new trials start that could be a good match.

What types of volunteers do clinical trials need? Clinical trials need volunteers of all different types, including those without PD. Researchers design clinical studies with certain eligibility criteria in mind based on the hypothesis they are testing in the trial. These criteria establish a set of guidelines for who can participate in a trial and outline the characteristics qualified volunteers must possess (e.g., age, gender, particular symptoms). At times, both interventional and observational studies also seek control volunteers who do not have Parkinson's disease. Having a control group in a study allows researchers to compare a drug's effect or a natural change in people with PD to individuals without PD to determine the difference. For study results to be statistically significant, researchers must ensure that their volunteer group is large enough and includes those most appropriate for the study.

What do the different trial phases mean? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its corollary agencies abroad require that clinical trials be conducted in a series of phases: Phase I trials test a potential therapy, procedure or drug for the first time in human beings. The most important goal at Phase I is to establish that a potential new treatment is safe for humans, typically in groups of 10-80. Phase II trials more comprehensively evaluate a treatment's safety and effectiveness in a larger group of participants (usually 100 to 300). Phase III trials confirm a therapy's effectiveness, monitor side effects and compare it against the current standard treatments in a large group of people (around 1,000 to 3,000). Phase III trials last longer, are usually conducted at multiple centers and evaluate whether a treatment will benefit people with Parkinson's — and if the benefits associated with a therapy outweigh the risks. Phase IV trials are conducted after a treatment has received FDA approval and been brought to market. These trials help further evaluate long-term side effects and potential new uses for other conditions. What do the different trial phases mean?

Clinical trials vary in flexibility regarding where certain evaluations or tests can be administered. Most trials will require at least one in-person visit; however that is not always the case. Trial teams can provide more information about how many visits are required and the frequency of visits. Some clinical trials may take the form of surveys, typically completed online, that do not require a physical visit to a site. Are there trials that do not require a visit to the trial site?

How do volunteers get involved in clinical trials for Parkinson's disease? To get started, interested volunteers can find studies using Fox Trial Finder . Volunteers can search studies by geography or other criteria, see a list of studies you may be eligible to join, and instantly connect with research teams through the platform by phone or email. Research teams can answer any questions about the trial and help determine if the trial is the right fit. Research teams are accustomed to spending time with volunteers to help them make decisions about trial participation, as they know that there are many details to consider before making an informed decision about participating. Before enrolling in a trial, volunteers may want to discuss trial participation with others, including family, friends, doctors, specialists or even local support group members who have participated in trials.

Why are clinical trials essential to the drug development process? The process of developing new drugs is long, expensive and arduous. Unfortunately, a drug is more likely to fail than to succeed at any given stage. The "graduation" of a potential Parkinson's drug to clinical testing is in itself cause for cautious celebration. This is because clinical testing is initiated only after therapies have already beaten the odds multiple times by moving successfully through years (and millions of dollars of investment) of chemical and biological studies, first in test tubes and Petri dishes, later in pre-clinical models. The U.S. FDA, and its corollary agencies abroad, requires that a potential therapy's safety and efficacy be tested extensively in a large group of human volunteers before it can receive approval to be manufactured and made available to patients. Yet clinical testing can — and often does — fail because not enough people volunteer. Without sufficient numbers of trial participants, the drug development process stalls and a trial must be repeated, scaled back or, even worse, the potential new therapy is abandoned. This lengthens the time it takes for new treatments to come to market. No amount of funding or other resources can compensate for the lack of clinical research volunteers. That's why volunteers can play a truly unique role at this pivotal stage of drug development, which is crucial for new treatments to reach pharmacy shelves.

Can volunteers leave a clinical trial after joining? Yes. Although ideally all study participants remain enrolled until the study's completion, circumstances, disease progression and other factors may contribute to a volunteer's decision to leave a trial. This is permissible at any time. To withdraw from a study, a volunteer should immediately inform the trial coordinator of this decision and will need to follow specific protocols to officially withdraw.

Can volunteers be compensated for participating in a clinical trial? Due to ethical and practical considerations, every trial has its own policy regarding volunteer compensation. Some trials may reimburse volunteers for expenses related to their participation or even offer some compensation to volunteers for participating. Some trials that require significant travel or an overnight stay may cover the associated expenses. A trial team member can provide more details on whether compensation is available as part of trial participation. Can volunteers be compensated for participating in a clinical trial?

Some trials that require significant travel or an overnight stay may cover the associated expenses. A trial team member can provide more details on whether compensation is available as part of trial participation. What happens when a trial is over? Once a clinical trial is over, the trial team assesses the data, distills key findings, publishes or presents any novel findings and determines the appropriate next steps for future testing, as appropriate. They may continue to evaluate the treatment in the next trial or discontinue research because the treatment has not been shown to be safe or effective. In some cases, if the treatment continues to the next phase, trial participants will be given the option of participating in that phase of the study as well. The FDA requires that trial results be published in a scientific or medical journal and made available to the public within 12 months of the last participant's visit. However, because it is hard for the FDA to track and enforce these regulations, it can be difficult to learn about trial results. Volunteers can search the Web or follow up with the trial team to inquire about study outcomes. What happens when a trial is over?

Volunteers can search the Web or follow up with the trial team to inquire about study outcomes. How are volunteer rights and my safety protected in a trial? Every trial follows an extensive and carefully monitored protocol subject to federal regulations, many of which focus on the safety of the participants in a trial. The protocol is a detailed plan that describes the study process. In addition to the protocol, each study has a consent form (also sometimes referred to as informed consent or consent to participate) that volunteers must read and sign before joining the study. The consent form will explain rights and responsibilities of a volunteer and what to expect during the study. Study protocols and consent forms must be reviewed and approved by a regulatory body before any volunteers can be approached about or recruited into a study to ensure that the study is safe, ethical and appropriate. Trial team members will discuss the consent form and any aspects of the protocol in detail during a trial screening visit. Volunteers can also request a copy of the consent form to review it in advance of this in-person visit. How are volunteer rights and my safety protected in a trial?

A progression biomarker ( or progression marker) can be any objectively measurable characteristic that changes over time in a way that can be correlated to the progression of disease. This type of marker is a critically needed tool for successful clinical trials, particularly trials of potential disease-modifying treatments. A diagnostic biomarker ( or diagnostic or risk marker) can be any objectively measurable physical characteristic associated with the presence of disease. Here are two examples from other health conditions: White blood cell count is objectively measurable and a progression marker of leukemia. A count that rises to abnormal levels indicates that the condition is getting worse, while a count that returns to normal indicates improvement. Cholesterol is objectively measurable and, when high, acts as a risk marker of potential heart disease. Progression markers could help transform the development of next-generation Parkinson's disease treatments. Imagine that researchers conducting Parkinson's disease clinical trials could run a straightforward, standardized laboratory test to understand how or if a possible new treatment was successfully slowing the disease process, helping to speed effective therapies toward pharmacy shelves. This is the kind of acceleration that a progression marker could make possible. Diagnostic markers could help transform diagnosis and treatment for people living with Parkinson's disease today. Imagine that your doctor could simply draw some blood and instantly confirm a Parkinson's disease diagnosis, know how far the disease had already progressed, and make an informed prediction about the rate and nature of your disease progression. While it may not ultimately come in the form of a blood test, this is the kind of simplicity and objectivity that a diagnostic marker for Parkinson's disease could make possible. What is a biomarker?

Fox Foundation worked on biomarkers before? Yes. With investments of over $54 million to date, The Michael J. Fox Foundation has spent years searching for a Parkinson's disease biomarker. As we embark on PPMI, we believe more strongly than ever that the discovery of Parkinson's disease biomarkers is a high-impact use of our intellectual and financial resources — and that this study will pay dividends toward better treatments and a cure.

Do other diseases have biomarkers? Some do, but most don't, and the lack of biomarkers is a particular problem for neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and ALS in addition to Parkinson's disease). You may have heard of a study called the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Launched in 2004, ADNI has made important strides toward discovering biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and has reinvigorated research focused on disease-modifying treatments for AD. We anticipate similar outcomes for Parkinson's from PPMI . Do other diseases have biomarkers?

Unfortunately, no practical, definitive biomarkers of Parkinson's disease have yet been identified. There are a few markers used in advanced neuroimaging techniques (approved for clinical use in Europe but not yet in the United States) that can help clinicians diagnose Parkinson's disease in its earliest stages. But no widely and easily applicable, affordable diagnostic markers, and no progression markers whatsoever, have been conclusively validated. What are the biomarkers of Parkinson's disease?

But no widely and easily applicable, affordable diagnostic markers, and no progression markers whatsoever, have been conclusively validated. In the absence of a PD biomarker, how have there been clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments at all? Most trials use some form of clinical measure, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), to determine whether a treatment is working. However, given the subjectivity and variance in clinical measures, and because symptoms of Parkinson's disease are affected by the medications and therapies patients have already used, it is difficult or impossible to measure disease-modifying effects in this way. This may have contributed to a history of inconclusive results from trials of disease-modifying treatments in particular.

This may have contributed to a history of inconclusive results from trials of disease-modifying treatments in particular. What are some specific ways that Parkinson's patients are affected by the lack of biomarkers? There is no way to identify people at risk for Parkinson's disease or to establish strategies for Parkinson's disease prevention. It is an often-stated reality that by the time the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease become evident, as many as 60-70 percent of an individual's dopamine neurons may already have died. A diagnostic marker would allow us to earlier identify people at risk for Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis is subjective, based on observing symptoms and rating them on a clinical scale. This translates to a high rate of misdiagnosis, especially among general practice physicians and neurologists who do not specialize in movement disorders. Parkinson's disease clinical trials are frequently and frustratingly inconclusive. Why? With no diagnostic marker, an estimated 10 percent of Parkinson's disease trial enrollees unwittingly do not have Parkinson's disease, confounding results. With no progression marker to track the disease, there is no way objectively to measure treatment effects. These factors make Parkinson's disease trials highly risky for drugmakers and prolong the wait for next-generation Parkinson's disease therapies.

I thought a biomarker was basically a gene — and don't we know the genes that play a role in PD? No — in fact, a biomarker is not the same thing as a gene or genetic mutation. Remember, it's possible to have one or more genetic irregularities linked to Parkinson's disease, but never get the disease. Genetic research leads scientists to certain biomarker candidates, but many other physical and cellular characteristics are valid as possible biomarkers if they are measurable and provide an accurate window into disease presence or progression. Here are the major avenues of pursuit today: Imaging-based markers (such as PET/SPECT) can provide indirect measures of dopamine neuron function, but do not have sufficient resolution to measure actual cell numbers. More sensitive neuroimaging markers for Parkinson's disease, capable of measuring dopamine function in the brain, are also under development. These include DATscan (already approved for clinical use in Europe) and other ways to measure dopamine activity. These dopamine-based markers may provide a way to monitor the disease in its earliest stages. MRI and ultrasound markers are also in development. Biological markers in blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid or tissue biopsies can serve as "signatures" of the disease. These can include genetic, protein or other chemical and molecular signposts. Leading biological marker candidates include measures of antioxidants such as urate, or measures of proteins produced by Parkinson's disease-implicated genes such as alpha-synuclein and DJ-1. Clinical measures — such as tests of motor ability — or the presence of disease-associated symptoms — such as loss of the sense of smell, sleep disorders, constipation or early speech problems — can be good markers. Though not necessarily Parkinson's-specific, they may still provide a means for detecting early stages of Parkinson's disease or tracking disease progression. The downside is that clinical measures are subjective, variable over time, and very sensitive to symptom-masking effects of drugs, limiting their utility to measure disease-modifying effects sought in neuroprotective trials. Overall, it is likely that we need to develop a combination of markers (imaging, biologics and clinical) and measure them in the same individuals over time to identify useful biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. The Foundation's PPMI study is designed to achieve just this. I thought a biomarker was basically a gene — and don't we know the genes that play a role in PD? No — in fact, a biomarker is not the same thing as a gene or genetic mutation. Remember, it's possible to have one or more genetic irregularities linked to Parkinson's disease, but never get the disease. Genetic research leads scientists to certain biomarker candidates, but many other physical and cellular characteristics are valid as possible biomarkers if they are measurable and provide an accurate window into disease presence or progression. Here are the major avenues of pursuit today: Imaging-based markers (such as PET/SPECT) can provide indirect measures of dopamine neuron function, but do not have sufficient resolution to measure actual cell numbers.

In general, we do not accept unsolicited proposals, although investigators are invited to contact research staff to help determine the RFA most appropriate for the proposed work. Do you have a Conflict of Interest policy for the Foundation reviewers of grant proposals? Yes. Reviewers may not submit a proposal to a program where they are acting as a reviewer or would have a clear and direct conflict. This includes proposals on which they are acting as a lead investigator or receiving payment. Additionally, reviewers are not allowed to participate in the discussion of any grant where the applicant is from the same institution as them or has a current collaboration with them.

How do I submit a full application once my pre-proposal has passed the first stage of review? For funding programs with a two-stage review process, applicants who pass the pre-proposal stage will be sent additional instructions via email for submitting a full proposal. Full proposals will be linked to pre-proposals through our online system. Applicants will be asked to update the online submission form of their original pre-proposal and attach proposal documents.

Full proposals will be linked to pre-proposals through our online system. Applicants will be asked to update the online submission form of their original pre-proposal and attach proposal documents. How is my full application reviewed? A review committee, made up of the Foundation's scientific staff and external experts in the fields appropriate to the funding program, reviews all of the proposals. In general, each proposal is reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Top proposals are discussed at a meeting of the review committee. MJFF scientific staff makes final award decisions based on feedback from these reviewer discussions and an analysis of current MJFF funding portfolio overlap. How is my full application reviewed?

MJFF scientific staff makes final award decisions based on feedback from these reviewer discussions and an analysis of current MJFF funding portfolio overlap. Do I need to submit a "pre-proposal"? Some programs require the submission of a "pre-proposal". Pre-proposals may require simply a brief summary of a project's goals and aims or may require more detailed information about the rationale and/or current status of a project idea. Programs may have different requirements for what to include in the pre-proposal and applicants should carefully review the submission instructions. Pre-proposals are reviewed by internal Foundation scientific staff and external advisors as appropriate in order to identify projects to invite for further funding consideration. Not all applicants will be invited to submit a full proposal. Given the desire for rapid decision making, no formal feedback is given to applicants whose projects are not invited to the second stage of review. Do I need to submit a "pre-proposal"?

Successful proposals are based on clear scientific ideas that hold obvious potential to impact our understanding of Parkinson's disease and ultimately development of improved treatments for people with the disease. Applicants should clearly state the scientific question being addressed and provide a detailed research plan. Proposals should fit the goals of the specific funding program, so it is important to review all program information before submitting a proposal. What makes a successful grant proposal?

Review the specific funding program information for details on expected review and funding decision dates. Can I have a deadline extension for submitting my proposal? No. The Foundation has tight timeframes for reviewing proposals, given our desire to fund work quickly. Therefore, we must strictly enforce our deadlines and no extensions are granted. Applicants should ensure they are available to communicate with Foundation staff after the deadline to answer possible questions regarding their proposal. If a proposal is submitted on time, but no one is available to answer clarifying questions after the deadline, the application could still be disqualified and removed from the review process.

Using other funding organization's instructions and templates (e.g., NIH) is not appropriate and could result in disqualification during administrative review. What is the Foundation's policy for direct and indirect costs? Budgets must be appropriate and justifiable for the work described. MJFF defines direct costs as expenses required to execute a grant that are directly attributable to and can reasonably be allocated to the project. Direct costs are comprised of the sum of the Personnel, Consultants, and Other Direct Costs sections of the MJFF budget template. In contrast, MJFF defines indirect costs as general overhead and administrative expenses that support the entire operation of the grantee and may be shared across projects (for example, utilities, IT systems, and general administrative staff such as a grants office). These expenses would be incurred regardless of whether the grant is funded. Recouping indirect costs on a grant is optional. However, MJFF allows grantees and subawardees to apply an indirect cost rate to their budget's total direct costs (the sum of personnel, consultants, and other direct costs), subject to the following limitations: Non-profit and academic institutions may apply up to a 15% indirect cost rate to their direct costs, and for-profit institutions may apply up to a 10% indirect cost rate to their direct costs. If multiple institutions are collaborating on a grant and both receiving funding directly through MJFF, each institution may apply an indirect cost rate to its institution's total direct costs in accordance with MJFF policy. If one institution is a non-profit and the other is a for-profit, the first may apply a rate of up to 15% to that institution's direct costs and the second may apply a rate of up to 10% to that institution's direct costs. If one collaborating institution's budget includes subawards (paid directly by the collaborating institution and reported in the Subawards section of the MJFF budget template), then the subawardee(s) may recoup indirect expenses through the application of an indirect rate to their direct costs. If the subawardee is a non-profit or academic institution, up to 15% may be applied. If the subawardee is a for-profit institution, up to 10% may be applied. Although subawards are reported to MJFF as lump sums on the MJFF budget template, MJFF expects collaborating institutions to request detailed budgets from their subawardees and ensure compliance with MJFF policy. It is MJFF's policy that an institution may not apply its own indirect cost rate to its subawards. For example, if an institution has $100,000 in personnel costs, $50,000 in consultant costs, $300,000 in other direct costs, and a $60,000 subaward, it may only apply its indirect cost rate to the sum of the personnel costs, consultant costs, and other direct costs. However, the $60,000 subaward may include indirect costs accruing to the subawardee institution. What is the Foundation's policy for direct and indirect costs?

However, the $60,000 subaward may include indirect costs accruing to the subawardee institution. Does the Foundation cover travel costs? Yes and no. The Foundation allows costs to cover travel necessary for completing a research project such as traveling off-site to perform work in the field or in a collaborator's lab. However, general travel costs to scientific conferences and meetings are not allowed. Travel costs for Foundation-required assessment meetings are paid directly by the Foundation and should not be included in the proposal budget. Does the Foundation cover travel costs? Yes and no.

Does the Foundation allow multi-investigator, collaborative proposals? Yes. Since one laboratory group may not possess the expertise in all steps of a particular project, collaborations are strongly encouraged for all proposals submitted to the Foundation. This is especially important for applicants seeking to use specific reagents or tools — including animal models of Parkinson's disease — for which the applicant has limited previous experience.

First, congratulations for receiving an MJFF award! Without you, The Michael J. Fox Foundation would not be able to promote the critical work needed to accelerate delivery of new treatments and a cure for people with Parkinson's disease. As an awardee, we welcome your hard work and commitment and look forward to interacting with you during the course of your project. It is important to understand that the Foundation in general funds specific research projects rather than simply providing funds to a researcher to use for general research efforts. Therefore, all awardees work with the Foundation's scientific staff to define an appropriate set of project deliverables and milestones. An awardee must also sign a contract that details the specific terms and conditions for accepting MJFF funding. If appropriate, additional special requirements for awardees are indicated in the funding program information. In general, awardees must guarantee they have not received, nor will seek, direct overlapping funding from another organization for a project that the Foundation agrees to fund. Awardees must provide valid approvals (IRB, IACUC, etc.) that cover the entire duration of the project period. Awardees also must participate in assessment meetings and calls as directed by MJFF staff, including submitting required progress and expense reports. Grantees must participate openly in discussions regarding the project with the Foundation's scientific and research staff and advisors. Grantees are also responsible for adhering to the Foundation's data sharing rules, as well as publishing information as quickly as possible. For any resulting publications (during or after the grant period), awardees are required to acknowledge that the project was funded by "a grant from The Michael J. Fox Foundation."

For any resulting publications (during or after the grant period), awardees are required to acknowledge that the project was funded by "a grant from The Michael J. Fox Foundation." Where can I find information about progress and expense report requirements for my grant? Awardees will be sent information and reporting templates when required by the Foundation staff for internal review or formal assessment meetings. It is important that reports are complete and accurate when submitted as these are often used for making decisions about continued payments and/or supplemental funding opportunities.

It is important that reports are complete and accurate when submitted as these are often used for making decisions about continued payments and/or supplemental funding opportunities. Can funds be reallocated and/or carried forward from year to year? Awardees are required to inform The Michael J. Fox Foundation if any changes need to be made to their award scope, budget or timeline. Funding reallocation decisions are made on a grant-by-grant basis. To request reallocation of funds (e.g., to move from supply costs to personnel costs), awardees must contact the Foundation's research staff for permission in advance of the reallocation. A justification for the reallocation request will be required, as well as an up-to-date expense report for the grant and details of the funds to be reallocated. Reallocations are subject to approval by the Foundation's research staff. In general, the Foundation has no problem carrying funds forward from one year to the next for multi-year projects. However, decisions about carrying forward funds are made on a grant-by-grant basis in the context of the grant timeline and suitable progress of the project. Carry-forward requests must be justified and should be communicated to the Foundation's Research staff through required expense reports, or by email if the Foundation staff has indicated that it is a case where a no-expense report is required.

Carry-forward requests are subject to approval by the Foundation's Research staff. Can I request a no-cost extension for my grant award? Yes, but no-cost extensions are approved only on a grant-by-grant basis. To request a no-cost extension, awardees must contact the Foundation research staff in advance of the end of the grant. Awardees must justify the reason for the no-cost extension request, as well as provide a proposed updated timeline for the completion of the work, and a current expense report for the grant. In general, an awardee may request only one no-cost extension Can I request a no-cost extension for my grant award? Yes, but no-cost extensions are approved only on a grant-by-grant basis.

Awardees must justify the reason for the no-cost extension request, as well as provide a proposed updated timeline for the completion of the work, and a current expense report for the grant. In general, an awardee may request only one no-cost extension Can I apply for supplemental funding? The Michael J. Fox Foundation considers supplemental funding requests on a case-by-case basis. Often, such considerations occur at the end of a grant when awardees have presented their final project results. The Foundation staff may request supplemental proposals as part of the post-award feedback. Awardees may also submit next-step proposals to open funding opportunities, but are encouraged to discuss such proposals with the Foundation's research staff before submitting. Please note that the Foundation cannot guarantee that supplemental funding will be available immediately upon completion of the original award and does not generally offer "bridge funding". Awardees should prepare for this possibility in advance of the end of the grant funding period. Can I apply for supplemental funding? The Michael J.

The Foundation will terminate funding when necessary. Reasons for termination are detailed in awardee contracts but may include improper use of funds or re-direction of funds toward activities not part of the project as funded. The best way to avoid termination of funds is to contact research team staff before making any major changes to your project scope. In addition, some projects may include clear "go/no-go" milestones where if the milestone is not met, the project will be terminated. Such milestones will be discussed with the awardee at the time of award contracting. Does The Michael J. Fox Foundation ever terminate funding? Yes.

Can funds be transferred to my new institution? For most Foundation grants, research funds stay with the Principal Investigator. If you change institutions, notify the Foundation research staff in advance of your move. You will need to provide an acknowledgment from both the current and future institution recognizing the transfer of work as well as funds, and a current expense report outlining spent and remaining funds. Unspent funds remaining at the original institution must be returned to the Foundation so that they can be provided to the new institution. I'm moving. Can funds be transferred to my new institution?

BioFIND was an observational clinical study designed to collect biosamples for Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker discovery and verification projects. The study was conducted at eight academic clinical sites in the United States. The recruitment recruited 119 Parkinson's patients (diagnosed within the last five to 15 years) and 96 controls began in 2012 and closed in 2015. This study was sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research with support from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). BioFIND was led by Principal Investigator Un Jung Kang of Columbia University. What is BioFIND?

A biomarker can be any objectively measurable physical characteristic associated with the presence of disease (diagnostic marker), or any characteristic that changes over time in a way that can be tied to the progression of disease (progression marker). Examples from other health conditions include: blood pressure, which is objectively and easily measured and, when high, acts as a diagnostic marker of potential heart disease; and, white blood cell count is a progression marker of leukemia. A count that rises to abnormal levels indicates that the condition is getting worse, while a count that returns to normal indicates improvement. Learn more about biomarkers . What are biomarkers?

Fox Foundation’s research team recently attended this year’s International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders ( AD/PD - Advances in Science & Therapy ) in Vienna, where thousands of experts gathered  to share the latest breakthroughs in research, diagnostics and treatment. 

Some highlights from this year include advancements in Alpha-synuclein PET Tracers and movement towards a biologic definition of PD. Collaboration and open science are vital for accelerating progress across Parkinson’s research. A major driver behind some of the work presented at the conference is MJFF’s landmark study, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). As the field advances, PPMI will remain an open-access resource – helping translate scientific insights into real-world impact for patients and families.

These neurons produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter important for motor control; however, as PD progresses, the death of dopaminergic neurons results in reduced dopamine levels and impairment of motor control. For FY22, Congress transitioned the Neurotoxin Exposure Treatment Parkinson's (NETP) program to the Parkinson's Research Program (PRP) and broadened the research from neurotoxin exposure treatment PD research to all types of PD research.  The PRP challenges the scientific community to develop the most impactful research that will advance the understanding of the disease, with the ultimate goal of ending PD. For information on toxic exposure research, please go to the Toxic Exposures Research Program at CDMRP.

Todd’s role includes contributing to key research initiatives such as MJFF’s  landmark clinical study, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, collaborating with MJFF’s world-class roster of partners including ASAP (Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s) and major entities in biopharma and government, and serving as mentor and strategic advisor to PhDs on staff. Dr. Sherer served as the Foundation’s Chief Executive Officer for 10 years, from May 2011 to May 2021. Dr. Sherer has been a key architect of the Foundation's strategy to define high-priority research areas for Parkinson's disease — therapeutic targets and approaches closest or most critical to practical relevance in patients' daily lives — and leverage donor-raised capital to push projects in these areas toward the clinic. He has played a major role in efforts to increase the pharmaceutical industry's investment in Parkinson's disease drug development and to engage the patient community to encourage and expand participation in clinical research. Today he is one of the world's foremost experts on the science and business of Parkinson's drug development, speaking frequently on these topics at conferences, to the media and to members of the Parkinson's community.

Allen Wang Work Posts ブログ記事 About I'm the Co-Founder and CTO of Outerport .  I was recently at Tome, an AI startup helping with making presentations. I was a founding member of the ML team and involved heavily across ML and product, seeing user growth from <1M to 20M. Before that I worked on computer vision for self driving at Embark Trucks. I received a master’s degree from University of Waterloo, where I did theoretical research at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical optimization, and made small contributions to the fields. I received my undergraduate degree also from Waterloo, where I majored in computer science and mathematics. Between school terms, I interned at companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and startups in San Francisco. I was born in China, and great up in Japan and Canada. I spent my childhood in Tsukuba, Japan, where I learned about friendship, and right and wrong.
