Long Island Obituaries David Diaz, award-winning television reporter for NBC and CBS in NYC, dies at 82 Diaz brought coverage of major events, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, O.J. Simpson trial and 9/11attacks, into the homes of countless New Yorkers. Credit: The Diaz Family By Robert Brodsky robert.brodsky@newsday.com @BrodskyRobert Updated March 19, 2025 Share David Diaz, an award-winning television reporter for NBC and CBS for nearly three decades who brought coverage of such events as the Oklahoma City bombing, the O.J. Simpson trial and the World Trade Center terror attacks into the homes of countless New Yorkers, has died at 82. Diaz died March 12. He had been suffering with frontotemporal dementia, according to Andrea Garcia-Diaz, 53, of Little Neck, Queens, his wife of 30 years. "We were blessed," she told Newsday on Tuesday. "We truly had an incredible love story together." The groundbreaking newsman was born in Puerto Rico in 1942, the only child of David and Teodora Diaz, who separated shortly after his birth. Diaz was raised primarily by his mother and the pair moved to Manhattan's Washington Heights when he was 3 years old, his wife said. David Diaz received degrees from Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx and City College in Manhattan before earning a master's in journalism at Columbia University. He later spent nearly a decade teaching mass media and politics and journalism at CCNY. Diaz worked for a time as an activist and print reporter before he was hired by NBC 4, where he would spend 15 years. He later spent a dozen years at CBS 2 before retiring in 2015, the network said. During his career, Diaz became the first Hispanic anchor for a major New York television organization, at NBC, and received five Emmy Awards, two Sigma Delta Chi Awards and an Associated Press Award. The broadcaster was ever-present at virtually every major news event in the city, from Bernie Goetz shooting four youths on a city subway train to the Tawana Brawley rape hoax case to every city mayoral administration from Ed Koch to Michael Bloomberg and the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He also covered national and international stories, including the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 167 people, the O.J. Simpson and Martha Stewart criminal trials and the custody battle between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow. "He was such a mentor," CBS News New York anchor and reporter Cindy Hsu said during an on-air tribute Monday. "He was a mentor from when I first met him in1993 and then after he left Channel 2, which was a huge loss to journalism in general. Then he wanted to keep helping, so he teaches. I miss him. I know it's a big hole in so many people's lives." Chuck Scarborough, a longtime WNBC/4 anchor who retired in December, said in a statement: "David and I worked together for 15 years. He was a superb, thoroughly dedicated broadcast journalist and delightful friend. David’s passion for our profession, effortless charm and dangerous sense of humor inspired all of us." In 2008, Diaz told the Daily News that he was suffering from a number of health problems, including sinus issues and headaches, stemming from his time reporting from Ground Zero. "Here at CBS News New York, we were lucky that he shared his remarkable abilities, generous spirit and infectious smile with us and our viewers," the station said in a statement. An NBC spokesman said: "David Diaz’s career as a reporter, anchor and educator was impactful and made a difference. All of us at WNBC were saddened to learn of David’s passing and we are thinking of his family during this difficult time." Diaz had two children from a previous marriage: Nina Diaz, 57, of West Hollywood, California, and Elena Diaz, 47, of New York City. Nina Diaz works as chief creative officer and president of content at Showtime/MTV studios & Paramount Media Networks. "He would say his two greatest achievements were his daughters," Andrea Diaz said of her husband. "They are humble. They're successful. They're kind. They are loving and loyal. And David had those same traits. He was a true gentleman. He was loyal. He championed for civil rights and the rights of minorities. And he was exceptionally proud of his Latin culture." In addition to his wife and daughters, Diaz is survived by a  son-in-law, Jonathan Miller, 55. The family is planning a private "celebration of life" service for Diaz at a future date.

(CBS) By Jessica Schladebeck | jschladebeck@nydailynews.com | New York Daily News UPDATED: March 19, 2025 at 6:04 PM EDT Beloved New York news man David Diaz , who spent his decades-long career delivering the latest to residents across the tri-state area, has died. He was 82. “You sent him out, you knew you were gonna get the story,” CBS News New York associate producer Wanda Prisinzano said. Few details were provided about the veteran reporter’s death . According to CBS, he died last week, but a specific timeframe was not available. His cause of death was also unclear, though family members have previously said he’d been living with a form of dementia in recent years that diminished his ability to communicate. Diaz, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1942, was just 3 years old when his family moved to Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan. He grew up there and attended Fordham Prep before going graduating from City College, and then Columbia University, where he earned his masters in journalism. An activist and community advocate, Diaz kicked off his career as a newspaper reporter before moving on-air with the NBC-owned WNBC.

Diaz spent his later years as a lecturer at CUNY , where he taught mass media and politics and journalism, according to his LinkedIn profile. David Diaz (CBS) CBS Evening News anchor Maurice Dubois remembered his former colleague as a “reporter’s reporter” and a “New York City guy,” who was “hard scrabble” while still striving to “bring others up as well.” CBS News New York’s Jennifer Jones echoed the sentiment, declaring Diaz a “legend.” “He understood New York City like very few journalist know and that was David Diaz,”  CBS News New York anchor Mary Calvi added. “He was a consummate professional, a charming, charming man.” Diaz is survived by his daughters, Elena, Nina, son-in-law Johnathan and his wife, Andrea.

Hard scrabble, you know, bringing himself up and wanted to bring others up as well,” CBS Evening News anchor Maurice Dubois . “He understood New York City like very few journalist know and that was David Diaz. He was a consummate professional, a charming, charming man,” CBS New York anchor Mary Calvi said. Family members say in recent years Diaz lived with a form of dementia that diminished his gifts of communication, but added even as his words faded, his spirit never did. “He was such a mentor. He was a mentor from when I first met him and 1993 and then after he left Channel 2, which was huge loss to journalism in general. Then he wanted to keep helping, so he teaches. I miss him. I know it’s a big hole in so many people’s lives,” said CBS New York anchor and reporter Cindy Hsu . Diaz is survived by his daughters, Elena, Nina, son-in-law Johnathan and his wife, Andrea.

Agencies EXCLUSIVE: The New York Times Sues Madwell for $37,000 in Unpaid Advertising Bills The embattled ad agency allegedly owes thousands to the media company for yet unpaid advertising services The New York times has filed a lawsuit against embattled Brooklyn ad agency Madwell. Kurt Kaiser By Kendra Barnett We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . The New York Times is suing Madwell, the Brooklyn-based indie ad agency that has come under mounting financial distress after a dramatic legal fallout between its cofounders and what multiple current and ex-staffers describe as reckless spending by CEO Chris Sojka. The complaint, which has been reviewed in part by ADWEEK, alleges that the agency owes the news publisher $37,176.38 plus interest for unpaid debts due for advertising services provided to Madwell or its “employees, agents, or representatives.” The sum “has not been provided although duly demanded” by the New York Times, the complaint, filed in Brooklyn’s Kings County Supreme Court, alleges. A spokesperson for the New York Times confirmed the lawsuit, but declined to comment further. This is the latest in a string of dramas beleaguering the indie ad agency. Madwell is undergoing serious financial and cultural turmoil , as originally uncovered in a multiweek ADWEEK investigation. In light of ongoing liquidity issues that have impeded the firm’s ability to make payroll and pay vendors on time—even as Sojka allegedly spent lavishly with company funds—it has reportedly lost one of its biggest clients, Verizon, and furloughed an estimated 28% of its staff . EXCLUSIVE: Madwell’s Madness: A $17.5M Private Jet, a $1M Launch Party, and Adderall ‘Connects’ Meanwhile, Bank of America is looking to seize Madwell’s assets after the agency defaulted on loan payments worth more than $4 million. Sojka, amid the drama, has attempted to explain his side of the story , offering ADWEEK an exclusive interview on the Adspeak podcast in which he sought to justify his purchase of a $17.5 million private jet and assigned blame for the agency’s financial strain to his ex-business partners. The New York Times is represented by William J. McDermott of William J. McDermott LLP, which specializes in commercial debt collection, real estate, and estate and trust law, according to its website. Madwell declined to comment.

Performance Marketing The Search is On By Lisa Wehr We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Ask any long-time market-watchers — people who’ve seen economic conditions rise and fall — and most will give you the same advice during a downturn: Stick to the basics. In the investment community, basics might include: remain liquid, shop for value, invest for the long term, look for undervalued opportunities and diversify. Those same basics are easily applied to online marketing. The pillar of online marketing is natural search. The better a Web site is optimized, the more likely it is to position well on the search engines. Highly positioned Web sites generate more traffic, and more traffic on a well-functioning Web site leads to more conversions and sales.

ADDITIONAL NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM 13.1 Persons Covered. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our processing of personal data. If you are located in the United Kingdom, then the Data Protection Act 2018 applies to our processing of personal data. These laws each grant those located respectively in the EEA and the UK a set of clear privacy rights and imposes responsibilities on Playwire as we process the personal data of data subjects located in those places. This section is designed to provide more information on how Adweek adheres to the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 and your rights as a data subject located in the UK or the EEA. 13.2 Your Data Protection Rights Both the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act define personal data broadly. As such, where Usage Data and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the EEA or UK we treat it as personal data. This includes: a) data collected via visits to Adweek.com; b) data collected from customers, vendors and business partners; and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees. Where the GDPR or UK Data Protection Act applies, such data subjects have certain rights, including: a) The right to be informed about the types of data being processed and the legal basis for processing; b) the right to access and see the data being processed; c) the right of rectification, to make corrections to data subject to processing; d) the right to erase data; e) the right to restrict processing of data; f) the right of data portability; g) the right to object to the processing of data and f) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making. Some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal basis relied upon to process the data. As an example, the right to object applies to processing which is carried out because it is necessary for our legitimate interests and only if we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which outweigh your rights, interests and freedoms. The same right does not apply to processing which is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or to perform a contract with you. Given that both the UK Data Protection Act and the GDPR defines personal data broadly, these rights may extend to the personal data we place into cookies or similar tracking technologies. You may request access to or ask us to correct, update, or delete your personal information by submitting a request here . You can update account information by contacting us at legal@adweek.com .

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Typically, our legitimate interests include: improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, content, and services; ensuring the security of the Services; and conducting marketing activities.

TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Cookies: “Cookies” give users a special ID, which are small text files that are stored in the memory of a user’s computer, mobile, e-reader, tablet or other device used to access the Adweek Applications (“Device”). Adweek employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Devices as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Devices cannot access many areas of the Devices. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Devices and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Devices easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and how data is stored. Web Beacons: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Devices, to monitor how users navigate the Devices, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Devices, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Devices, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. HTML5: We may use HTML5 in the Devices, including without limitation in Adweek mobile websites and certain mobile applications for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 storage doesn’t use the browser “cookies” file. The ability of a user to disable HTML5 storage while simultaneously leaving cookies enabled is browser dependent. E-tags/cache browsers/web logs: Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and Device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Devices. We may track your movement within the Devices, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Devices, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or Device identification from the Device that you used to access our Devices and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Devices, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications. Privacy Policy LAST UPDATED AND EFFECTIVE : March 31, 2023 1. WHO WE ARE 2.

TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Cookies: “Cookies” give users a special ID, which are small text files that are stored in the memory of a user’s computer, mobile, e-reader, tablet or other device used to access the Adweek Applications (“Device”). Adweek employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Devices as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Devices cannot access many areas of the Devices. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Devices and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Devices easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and how data is stored. Web Beacons: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Devices, to monitor how users navigate the Devices, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Devices, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Devices, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. HTML5: We may use HTML5 in the Devices, including without limitation in Adweek mobile websites and certain mobile applications for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 storage doesn’t use the browser “cookies” file. The ability of a user to disable HTML5 storage while simultaneously leaving cookies enabled is browser dependent. E-tags/cache browsers/web logs: Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and Device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Devices. We may track your movement within the Devices, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Devices, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or Device identification from the Device that you used to access our Devices and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Devices, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

ADDITIONAL NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM 13.1 Persons Covered. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our processing of personal data. If you are located in the United Kingdom, then the Data Protection Act 2018 applies to our processing of personal data.

This includes: a) data collected via visits to Adweek.com; b) data collected from customers, vendors and business partners; and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees.

TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Cookies: “Cookies” give users a special ID, which are small text files that are stored in the memory of a user’s computer, mobile, e-reader, tablet or other device used to access the Adweek Applications (“Device”). Adweek employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Devices as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Devices cannot access many areas of the Devices. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Devices and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Devices easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and how data is stored. Web Beacons: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Devices, to monitor how users navigate the Devices, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Cookies: “Cookies” give users a special ID, which are small text files that are stored in the memory of a user’s computer, mobile, e-reader, tablet or other device used to access the Adweek Applications (“Device”). Adweek employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Devices as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Devices cannot access many areas of the Devices. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Devices and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Devices easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and how data is stored. Web Beacons: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Devices, to monitor how users navigate the Devices, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Devices, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Devices, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. HTML5: We may use HTML5 in the Devices, including without limitation in Adweek mobile websites and certain mobile applications for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 storage doesn’t use the browser “cookies” file. The ability of a user to disable HTML5 storage while simultaneously leaving cookies enabled is browser dependent. E-tags/cache browsers/web logs: Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and Device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Devices. We may track your movement within the Devices, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Devices, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or Device identification from the Device that you used to access our Devices and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Devices, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

Ad Tech Industry News The Winners and Losers of Google’s Big Cookie Reversal ID providers and open web publishers rejoice—while Privacy Sandbox investors and privacy advocates nurse their wounds Google this week pulled a U-turn on a five-year plan to cut cookies from Chrome. By Kendra Barnett & Lucinda Southern We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Google on Tuesday said it will keep cookies in their current form in its Chrome browser, and will walk back a previous commitment to build a simple opt-out tool for users who don’t wish to be tracked. The digital ad ecosystem—which has invested significant resources and manpower to develop cookieless ways to track and target audiences and measure media performance—responded with a mix of shock, exasperation, and relief. Google’s stock price, meanwhile, spiked about 3.8% on the back of the news. Here are the winners and losers of Google’s cookie reversal, according to ad industry insiders and analysts. Google Will Keep Cookies and Backtrack on its Opt-Out Plans The Winners The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, and Yahoo Organizations that use cookies but have also dedicated resources to develop alternative approaches, like cookieless ID solutions, are poised to capitalize on Google’s new stance. Within that cohort, The Trade Desk may be particularly well-positioned thanks to its popular identifier, Unified ID 2.0, which has become a valuable tool for targeting audiences on the open web. CEO Jeff Green said on an investor call last year the ID has “reached a critical mass of adoption.” (Although the company has stumbled this year in the wake of subpar Q4 financials and its floundering media buying platform, Kokai ). Like The Trade Desk, LiveRamp stands to benefit thanks to its cookie-linked business and its efforts to develop a privacy-safe ID solution, RampID. “They’re already in the cookie-matching space,” said Ameet Shah, partner and svp of publisher operations and strategy at Prohaska Consulting. “LiveRamp’s business is still very, very solid, and when you really think of their upside potential, it’s all the relationships they’ve made over the last several years … because they’ve looked at other ways to match and link data with marketers and bring in data collaboration.” CEO Travis Clinger is bullish on LiveRamp’s future. “Marketers need to be everywhere their customers are, and measure how those touchpoints perform. Cookies can’t do that,” he told ADWEEK. A robust omnichannel strategy, he said, demands more, requiring both “first-party data and authenticated identity.” LiveRamp’s stock has spiked over 7% since Google’s announcement Tuesday. Other leading identity providers like Yahoo may also benefit from stronger data signals. At this point, any adtech firm with a significant portion of its business linked to the open web may gain off the pivot, according to Ari Paparo, CEO of Marketecture Media. “They make high-margin, solid revenues on the back of the cookie,” he said. “And that revenue, in many cases, was assumed to be on its way out. It doesn’t seem to be anymore.” PubMatic, Magnite, and larger SSPs On the sell side, large supply-side platforms (SSPs) like PubMatic, Magnite, and Index Exchange will win, thanks to their efforts to integrate ID signals from publishers and their contextual insights. “The advantage that some of these platforms have is that they work with publishers to receive better signal, and that continues to be a benefit” in the era of third-party cookies, according to Shah of Prohaska Consulting. PubMatic, for its part, launched its identity management solution, Identity Hub, in 2020, allowing publishers to support various identifiers for every ad impression. Index Exchange and Magnite both offer similar solutions. With cookies here to stay, these parts of the business are likely to flourish. Plus, major SSPs are likely to maintain a strong position thanks to the value of the rich contextual signals at their disposal. Even with cookies still in the mix, SSPs have direct access to page-level content and real-time contextual data, which will remain valuable for brand safety, creative relevance, and targeting in cookie-free environments like Safari, Firefox, and mobile apps. “Magnite sees this latest third-party cookie postponement as a welcome admission of the challenges with Privacy Sandbox proposals and a near term boon for the open web,” Garrett McGrath, svp of product management said in a statement shared with ADWEEK. Nonetheless, he said, the company will maintain a focus on “first-party signals and ensuring publishers and consumers retain control of addressability….” Vox Media, Newsweek, and other cookie-reliant publishers A variety of open web publishers may also be heaving a sigh of relief. “The reprieve sustains revenue streams for publishers reliant on third-party cookies, particularly smaller outlets and journalism platforms,” said Lou Paskalis, chief strategy officer at Ad Fontes Media, a media watchdog. In particular, he points to outlets like Vox Media and Newsweek that have logged-in environments in which cookies enable them to supplement other data sets—information that ultimately helps them parse intent. And by some arguments, intent is more valuable than identity for advertisers. “If I could only know one thing about you, I’d rather know that you’re in the market for a new product than who you are,” Paskalis said. The Winners—with a caveat Criteo, Audigent, and other big Privacy Sandbox investors Leading open web adtech firms like Criteo are likely to see a bottom line benefit thanks to cookies’ resilience. Last year, Criteo’s CFO Sarah Glickman said the firm anticipated losses up to $40 million in the second half of 2024 as Google moved to sunset cookies. Now, with those plans nixed, Criteo blocks those potential losses. On the other hand, Criteo and others are likely to incur costs for their steep investments in cookieless solutions developed through Google’s Privacy Sandbox, experts say. Criteo has been perhaps the most public in its support of the effort; the company dedicated around 100 employees to testing Sandbox products, Marketing Brew reported last year. “They invested a lot and they might think that this was a big waste of effort,” said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at media firm Raptive. The company said it has “future-proofed” its approach to privacy-protected addressability, noting in a statement shared with ADWEEK that it employs “advanced AI to consolidate and then optimize diverse signals, including alternative IDs, first-party data, contextual inputs and browser-based tools like the Privacy Sandbox.” Criteo isn’t alone in its position. Audigent, an identity platform, invested “several million dollars” into Privacy Sandbox, the company’s CEO Drew Stein confirmed to Reuters last September. It represents a major bet, as the company’s annual revenue hovers around $150 million. Other adtech players including NextRoll, Index Exchange, and RTB House have publicly commented on their commitments to testing Privacy Sandbox solutions. Now, these firms may be tallying the sunk costs. “The reactions I hear in private are [full of] fury,” said Paparo. “The anger among the people who have spent time on this is pretty intense.” NextRoll, for its part, stands by its approach. “While we have invested heavily in the Privacy Sandbox, those efforts were not made for optics, but for impact,” Andrew Pascoe, NextRoll’s vp of data science engineering told ADWEEK. “Consumers continue to demand greater transparency and control over their data, and we remain committed to advancing privacy-first solutions, regardless of the status of third-party cookies.” RTB House took a similar position. “We remain committed to operating with customers to strengthen campaigns across any environment, cookied or otherwise,” said Michael Lamb, chief commercial officer, in a statement. “This update does not change RTB House’s commitment to user privacy.” Index Exchange’s svp of product, Michael McNeeley, noted that “this moment reinforces what we already know: change is the only constant” in the adtech industry. “Some of it’s good, some of it’s bad, and a lot of it falls into the unknown,” he told ADWEEK. “We see this as a reminder that the future of privacy in advertising won’t be shaped by any one solution—or any one company.” Nonetheless, these companies have largely avoided putting all their eggs in the Privacy Sandbox basket, and therefore are insulated from what could have been a potentially worse outcome. Criteo’s stock surged on the heels of Google’s announcement Tuesday. The Losers Google Google itself may be a loser in the final count, due to the PR hit incurred in its dramatic backtracking. “This is a huge reputational hit—they just look like fools,” said Paparo. “They wasted four or five years of people’s careers and time, and they didn’t do anything meaningful for privacy. They lost a lot of goodwill. I don’t see a positive here for them.” Paskalis shared the assessment. “Google’s credibility erodes again, with developers and advertisers questioning its long-term roadmap,” he said. Google made its cookie U-turn announcement this week amid a smattering of broader PR challenges: the company’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Justice Department over the company’s monopoly power in online search—and the fallout from a separate antitrust ruling last week that found the company guilty of operating an illegal monopoly in adtech . Some adland insiders have questioned whether the timing was strategic. Google declined a request for comment. Privacy advocates Among the biggest losers will be privacy advocates, who’ve long argued for a shift away from deterministic tools for advertising and supported consent-based frameworks for online tracking. “Google’s decision to keep third-party cookies around a bit longer is a step back for privacy and equity,” said Josh Walsh, CEO and cofounder of BranchLab, a privacy-focused healthcare advertising company. “This moment should be a wake-up call to rethink how we define addressability. There are privacy-conscious, data-responsible ways to reach broad and representative audiences that don’t depend on IDs to work. That shift is already underway, and it’s important we don’t lose momentum.” Consumers Consumers, at the end of the day, will lose enhanced privacy protections that Google has been promising for years. “For consumers, we could be shifting to a better advertising system faster,” said Ana Milicevic, cofounder at Sparrow Advisers. Still, some experts are betting that the tide of privacy will rise in both the regulatory sphere and the digital media ecosystem. “The privacy environment can only get more restrictive,” said Eric Seufert, a leading media strategist, adding that he sees the industry moving away from deterministic IDs. “Even if third-party cookies aren’t going anywhere on Chrome, the marketing ecosystem is evolving away from deterministic identity.” It’s a sentiment echoed by Raptive’s Bannister. “The third-party cookie’s days,” he said, “are still numbered.” Update 4/24 at 4:22pm ET: This story has been updated to include a statement from Magnite’s Garrett McGrath.

Kendra Barnett Lucinda Southern  We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Google on Tuesday said it will keep cookies in their current form in its Chrome browser, and will walk back a previous commitment to build a simple opt-out tool for users who don’t wish to be tracked. The digital ad ecosystem—which has invested significant resources and manpower to develop cookieless ways to track and target audiences and measure media performance—responded with a mix of shock, exasperation, and relief. Google’s stock price, meanwhile, spiked about 3.8% on the back of the news. Here are the winners and losers of Google’s cookie reversal, according to ad industry insiders and analysts.  Google Will Keep Cookies and Backtrack on its Opt-Out Plans   The Winners The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, and Yahoo Organizations that use cookies but have also dedicated resources to develop alternative approaches, like cookieless ID solutions, are poised to capitalize on Google’s new stance. Within that cohort, The Trade Desk may be particularly well-positioned thanks to its popular identifier, Unified ID 2.0, which has become a valuable tool for targeting audiences on the open web. CEO Jeff Green said on an investor call last year the ID has “reached a critical mass of adoption.” (Although the company has stumbled this year in the wake of subpar Q4 financials and its floundering media buying platform, Kokai ). Like The Trade Desk, LiveRamp stands to benefit thanks to its cookie-linked business and its efforts to develop a privacy-safe ID solution, RampID. “They’re already in the cookie-matching space,” said Ameet Shah, partner and svp of publisher operations and strategy at Prohaska Consulting. “LiveRamp’s business is still very, very solid, and when you really think of their upside potential, it’s all the relationships they’ve made over the last several years … because they’ve looked at other ways to match and link data with marketers and bring in data collaboration.” CEO Travis Clinger is bullish on LiveRamp’s future. “Marketers need to be everywhere their customers are, and measure how those touchpoints perform. Cookies can’t do that,” he told ADWEEK. A robust omnichannel strategy, he said, demands more, requiring both “first-party data and authenticated identity.” LiveRamp’s stock has spiked over 7% since Google’s announcement Tuesday. Other leading identity providers like Yahoo may also benefit from stronger data signals. At this point, any adtech firm with a significant portion of its business linked to the open web may gain off the pivot, according to Ari Paparo, CEO of Marketecture Media. “They make high-margin, solid revenues on the back of the cookie,” he said. “And that revenue, in many cases, was assumed to be on its way out. It doesn’t seem to be anymore.” PubMatic, Magnite, and larger SSPs On the sell side, large supply-side platforms (SSPs) like PubMatic, Magnite, and Index Exchange will win, thanks to their efforts to integrate ID signals from publishers and their contextual insights. “The advantage that some of these platforms have is that they work with publishers to receive better signal, and that continues to be a benefit” in the era of third-party cookies, according to Shah of Prohaska Consulting. PubMatic, for its part, launched its identity management solution, Identity Hub, in 2020, allowing publishers to support various identifiers for every ad impression. Index Exchange and Magnite both offer similar solutions. With cookies here to stay, these parts of the business are likely to flourish. Plus, major SSPs are likely to maintain a strong position thanks to the value of the rich contextual signals at their disposal. Even with cookies still in the mix, SSPs have direct access to page-level content and real-time contextual data, which will remain valuable for brand safety, creative relevance, and targeting in cookie-free environments like Safari, Firefox, and mobile apps. “Magnite sees this latest third-party cookie postponement as a welcome admission of the challenges with Privacy Sandbox proposals and a near term boon for the open web,” Garrett McGrath, svp of product management said in a statement shared with ADWEEK. Nonetheless, he said, the company will maintain a focus on “first-party signals and ensuring publishers and consumers retain control of addressability….” Vox Media, Newsweek, and other cookie-reliant publishers A variety of open web publishers may also be heaving a sigh of relief. “The reprieve sustains revenue streams for publishers reliant on third-party cookies, particularly smaller outlets and journalism platforms,” said Lou Paskalis, chief strategy officer at Ad Fontes Media, a media watchdog. In particular, he points to outlets like Vox Media and Newsweek that have logged-in environments in which cookies enable them to supplement other data sets—information that ultimately helps them parse intent. And by some arguments, intent is more valuable than identity for advertisers. “If I could only know one thing about you, I’d rather know that you’re in the market for a new product than who you are,” Paskalis said. The Winners—with a caveat Criteo, Audigent, and other big Privacy Sandbox investors Leading open web adtech firms like Criteo are likely to see a bottom line benefit thanks to cookies’ resilience. Last year, Criteo’s CFO Sarah Glickman said the firm anticipated losses up to $40 million in the second half of 2024 as Google moved to sunset cookies. Now, with those plans nixed, Criteo blocks those potential losses. On the other hand, Criteo and others are likely to incur costs for their steep investments in cookieless solutions developed through Google’s Privacy Sandbox, experts say. Criteo has been perhaps the most public in its support of the effort; the company dedicated around 100 employees to testing Sandbox products, Marketing Brew reported last year. “They invested a lot and they might think that this was a big waste of effort,” said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at media firm Raptive. The company said it has “future-proofed” its approach to privacy-protected addressability, noting in a statement shared with ADWEEK that it employs “advanced AI to consolidate and then optimize diverse signals, including alternative IDs, first-party data, contextual inputs and browser-based tools like the Privacy Sandbox.” Criteo isn’t alone in its position. Audigent, an identity platform, invested “several million dollars” into Privacy Sandbox, the company’s CEO Drew Stein confirmed to Reuters last September. It represents a major bet, as the company’s annual revenue hovers around $150 million. Other adtech players including NextRoll, Index Exchange, and RTB House have publicly commented on their commitments to testing Privacy Sandbox solutions. Now, these firms may be tallying the sunk costs. “The reactions I hear in private are [full of] fury,” said Paparo. “The anger among the people who have spent time on this is pretty intense.” NextRoll, for its part, stands by its approach. “While we have invested heavily in the Privacy Sandbox, those efforts were not made for optics, but for impact,” Andrew Pascoe, NextRoll’s vp of data science engineering told ADWEEK. “Consumers continue to demand greater transparency and control over their data, and we remain committed to advancing privacy-first solutions, regardless of the status of third-party cookies.” RTB House took a similar position. “We remain committed to operating with customers to strengthen campaigns across any environment, cookied or otherwise,” said Michael Lamb, chief commercial officer, in a statement. “This update does not change RTB House’s commitment to user privacy.” Index Exchange’s svp of product, Michael McNeeley, noted that “this moment reinforces what we already know: change is the only constant” in the adtech industry. “Some of it’s good, some of it’s bad, and a lot of it falls into the unknown,” he told ADWEEK. “We see this as a reminder that the future of privacy in advertising won’t be shaped by any one solution—or any one company.” Nonetheless, these companies have largely avoided putting all their eggs in the Privacy Sandbox basket, and therefore are insulated from what could have been a potentially worse outcome.

Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . The decline of indie agency Madwell— documented by ADWEEK following a multi-week investigation—has been marked by legal drama, extravagant expenses, in-office confrontations, and consistently delayed pay to vendors and employees under the leadership of CEO Chris Sojka.

Agencies EXCLUSIVE: Madwell Furloughs Employees as Financial Distress Mounts An estimated 20-30 staffers—roughly 28% of the company's total headcount—were affected, according to two impacted employees The indie shop issued furlough notices to employees Wednesday morning. Madwell By Kendra Barnett We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Madwell, the independent ad agency under significant financial stress with millions of dollars in loan defaults and allegedly rash decision-making by CEO Chris Sojka, has issued furlough notices to some employees. The furloughs affect an estimated 20 to 30 staffers, or roughly 28% of staff, two impacted employees told ADWEEK. Listen to ADWEEK’s Exclusive Interview with Chris Sojka In an email sent to impacted employees on Wednesday (April 16) at around 7 a.m. ET, HR representative Alyssa Montalvo-Rios said the agency is “initiating a company-wide furlough in order to address recent operational challenges and conduct a necessary internal review.” Montalvo-Rios added that Madwell’s leadership will assess its options over the next two weeks and will update impacted employees on their “potential reinstatement.” One impacted employee told ADWEEK they were immediately cut off from all company accounts and communications, including their email and Slack accounts. “In order to preserve operational viability, we have furloughed a significant number of Madwellians. We continue to affirm our obligations to pay every dollar owed to our employees,” a Madwell spokesperson said in a statement shared with ADWEEK. “Our hope is to continue [sic] so we can provide remuneration to the many small businesses and individuals who are our creditors. This will require cooperation from our largest one. Madwell’s priority continues to be limiting further impact on our people and our clients.” EXCLUSIVE: Madwell’s Madness: A $17.5M Private Jet, a $1M Launch Party, and Adderall ‘Connects’ The news comes just hours after it was reported that Madwell lost one of its largest clients, Verizon, on Friday—a hit that Sojka estimated in an email to staff would cost the company eight figures in annual revenue. In recent weeks, the agency’s liquidity problems have come into sharp focus as it has struggled to make payroll on time for multiple consecutive pay cycles. Meanwhile, Bank of America quietly filed a request with a U.S. district court in New York seeking a judgment against Madwell and other entities owned by Sojka to recover over $4 million in defaulted loans and post-settlement payments. Should the court grant the request, the bank may have the green light to seize the agency’s assets to help repay the debt. Sojka, in the meantime, has lashed out at employees seeking answers .

The brand’s vp of global communications, Letena Lindsay, is also departing after seven years amid a restructuring, which will see the fitness business split the marketing function into two separate teams. A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the changes to ADWEEK. Searches for a CMO and a chief communications officer are now underway. In the interim, recently appointed CEO and president, Peter Stern, will oversee marketing. Weinberg joined Peloton in January 2024 from Intuit, where she oversaw the QuickBooks brand. Her campaigns for Peloton, including “Find your push. Find your power,” focused on the company’s suite of services for customers with varying fitness goals, positioning it as more than a stationary bike seller . During her short tenure, she also focused on making Peloton’s marketing budget—which was cut by 19% between 2023 and 2024—work harder, along with improving its measurement tools. Since 2020, Peloton has had three chief marketing officers: Dara Treseder, Leslie Berland , and Weinberg. An uphill journey Peloton’s latest marketing reshuffle follows two years of significant business challenges for the high-end fitness brand, which appointed Ford exec and Apple Fitness+ co-founder Stern as CEO in January to lead its turnaround plan. A success story of the pandemic era, Peloton experienced a surge in demand as customers sought at-home fitness solutions. In 2021, its value soared to $50 billion. However, as lockdown restrictions eased and gyms reopened, demand for its equipment has waned. The company has since grappled with overproduction, supply chain issues, and a 2023 bike seat post recall, which impacted 2.2 million units and cost $40 million. Peloton’s Kendall Toole on Fitness, Empowerment and Inspiring People Beyond the Bike Following sluggish sales, it returned to modest growth at the end of 2024. In Q2 2025, sales declined year-over-year from $744 million to $674 million. However, the company cut millions’ worth of expenses and increased its gross profit from $299 million to $318 million in the same period. In February, Peloton told investors: “We see significant opportunities ahead, but we have a steep hill to climb to reach sustained, profitable growth. Returning to growth begins with a new focus on and execution against our purpose–empowering people to live fit, strong, long, and happy.” Rebecca Stewart rebecca.stewart@adweek.com Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

How Today’s Economy Is Transforming Brand Loyalty Wed, May 14, 2025 1:00 PM ET In today’s economy, consumers aren’t just browsing, they’re budgeting, balking, and brutally prioritizing. With inflation lingering, tariffs impacting supply chains, and wallets tightening, the path to purchase has become more selective. Join us as we unpack what economic pressures mean for consumer decision-making and how brands can remain in the consideration set as prices continue rising. We’ll explore real-time data from Brand Rank surveys across key verticals including automotive, travel, CPG, and retail, revealing which brands are breaking through and what all brands can do to more meaningfully connect with consumers during this trying time. Key Takeaways: Inflation and pricing pressures have made consumers more selective, forcing brands to re-earn every dollar. Emotional connection is becoming a key differentiator, helping brands justify premium pricing and retain loyalty. Brand Rank data highlights shifting loyalties across key verticals, offering insight into which brands are gaining ground and why. See all upcoming ADWEEK webinars.

Agencies Bank of America Is Going After Madwell’s Assets After Multiple Loan Payment Defaults The bank aims to collect the funds due by Madwell and other organizations associated with Chris Sojka, recent court documents reveal Bank of America is asking a New York district court to enforce judgment against the controversy-embroiled ad agency and allow the bank to collect the money it's owed. Bank Of America, Madwell, Getty Images By Kendra Barnett We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Bank of America is attempting to collect the money it’s owed from controversy-riddled ad agency Madwell and other entities owned by agency CEO Chris Sojka after the organizations defaulted on more than $4 million of loans, and then defaulted on post-settlement payments to the bank. In court documents filed between January and March, reviewed by ADWEEK, the bank asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to issue an official judgment against Madwell and to order the turnover of collateral—meaning that any assets pledged as security for the loans should be given over to the bank to help repay the debt. Last spring, Bank of America sued Madwell, its fabrication company Millwright, and two affiliated LLCs—Get In Get Out and Maple Syrup and Jam (doing business as Starfish) for defaulting on loans worth about $4 million. Sojka, whose aggressive behavior and exorbitant spending has coincided with Madwell’s financial troubles , is the sole owner of all of the entities. EXCLUSIVE: Madwell’s Madness: A $17.5M Private Jet, a $1M Launch Party, and Adderall ‘Connects’ By the end of October 2024, the total outstanding balance of the loans stood at approximately $4.59 million, which included a principal balance of about $4.04 million, plus interest, late fees, and legal fees. (Meanwhile, just weeks prior, Sojka obtained a loan to purchase a $17.5 million private jet, even as Madwell struggled to consistently make payroll on time , as previously reported by ADWEEK ). The parties reached a court-approved settlement on November 7, 2024, which required that the four defendant organizations pay back the money owed to Bank of America in installations. Bank of America received one $400,000 principal payment on November 15, as well as a monthly interest payment due November 30. But then, defendants failed to make the next two required principal payments—due November 30 and December 31—as well as their December interest payment. According to the settlement terms, Bank of America argues, the missed payments constitute a breach of the settlement, and give the bank the right to ask the court for immediate judgment. By January 6, despite the initial payments, Madwell and the other defendants still owed over $4.1 million, consisting primarily of $3.64 million in principal, plus various interest charges, late fees, and nearly $157,000 in attorneys’ fees. Interest continues to pile up at about $1,385 per day, court documents indicate. Bank of America is now imploring the court to enter a judgment and allow it to seize collateral to secure the loans. In a statement, Sojka blamed previous executives for Madwell’s debt, and said that “…Madwell has continued to service this debt, making over $2 million in payments and counting. Bank of America has continued to reserve its rights to take action while kindly affording Madwell breathing room to complete a turnaround. We are grateful for their support and professionalism in this trying time and are looking forward to reaching an amicable conclusion for all parties.” Bank of America declined a request for comment. Lawyers representing the bank at Chapman and Cutler did not respond to requests for comment.

Adweek Podcasts Embattled Madwell CEO Chris Sojka Reveals the Agency's Future How a $17.5M jet will be worth $23M, working with Wiz Khalifa, and a theme park 'exercise' in Dripping Springs, Texas. By Ryan Joe We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . Madwell CEO Chris Sojka has been the subject of a lot of controversy over the past two years, centered on his management of the agency he co-founded and how he’s treated its employees . Last week, I sat down with him for a one-on-one conversation, which is now dropping in this bonus episode of our new podcast Adspeak. In it, Sojka addresses whether Madwell’s payroll issues are fully resolved, how the agency could possibly stay solvent, why buying a $17.5 million plane was a good investment, why he has a chief of henchmen, and discusses—briefly—a secret “exercise” in Dripping Springs, Texas. The interview has been edited for length. Be sure to listen in for an inside look at how Sojka plans to save Madwell, especially as Bank of America is looking to collect on its massive debt . Ryan Joe Ryan Joe is the editor in chief of Adweek. He has been covering data-driven marketing and advertising for over a decade, striving to make its complexities understandable and accessible. He started out as a reporter for the Haymarket publication DMNews in the early 2010s, then moved to AdExchanger where he worked for nearly eight years, covering the industry as investment shifted to digital advertising. He ended his tenure at AdExchanger as managing editor, jumping to Business Insider in 2021 to help lead its scoop-driven coverage of the ad industry.
Joe is a graduate of UCLA and Columbia.

Madwell CEO Chris Sojka has been the subject of a lot of controversy over the past two years, centered on his management of the agency he co-founded and how he’s treated its employees . Last week, I sat down with him for a one-on-one conversation, which is now dropping in this bonus episode of our new podcast Adspeak. In it, Sojka addresses whether Madwell’s payroll issues are fully resolved, how the agency could possibly stay solvent, why buying a $17.5 million plane was a good investment, why he has a chief of henchmen, and discusses—briefly—a secret “exercise” in Dripping Springs, Texas. The interview has been edited for length. Be sure to listen in for an inside look at how Sojka plans to save Madwell, especially as Bank of America is looking to collect on its massive debt .

“It’s arguably the unit of measure in the world of live sports,” said Deep Blue partner, Gotham FC and Seattle Storm owner and soon-to-be Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Sue Bird. “It’s where a lot of the value of the product lives, because the price tags are so high.”

The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) 's most recent $240 media deal with Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios , ESPN , The E.W. Scripps Company , and CBS Sports was more than 53 times larger than the deal that preceded it. The WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) 's new $2.2 billion media rights package with Amazon, ESPN, and NBCUniversal is four times larger than its current deal.

“It’s creating more visibility for our athletes and helping us grow our fan base and attract a broader audience,” said the NY LIBERTY 's Shana R. Stephenson ,  “If you really look at engagement and the commitment of our fans and the loyalty of our fans, that’s where the investment really shows up, and that’s where it really makes a lot of sense.”

As Deep Blue founder and CEO Laura Correnti pointed out, that influx of media investment is helping new leagues like League One Volleyball (LOVB) , Athletes Unlimited 's AUSL, and the United Soccer League (USL) Super League off the ground and bringing new advertisers including Spanx and REVOLVE into the mix. While media rights helped increase the value of teams Monarch Collective helped found—including Angel City Football Club and San Diego Wave Fútbol Club —Monarch's Jasmine Robinson noted that media rights dollars are having an impact on how leagues like the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) craft collective bargaining agreements with players.

“I think there’s still a ton of way to go in terms of getting female athletes to continue to get paid and be valued for the value that they’re creating for leagues and teams,” Robinson said. “A lot of that is making sure that we’re getting the monetization done right with media companies and with brands in collaboration with those stakeholders, because we’re all collaborating in this ecosystem to build something that really works for the long run and is sustainable and continues to scale.”

Earnings Reports Tariffs Likely to Contribute to PepsiCo’s 2025 Earnings Decline The beverage and snacks giant lowered its expectations to be on par with 2024 The concentrate for Pepsi and Mountain Dew is made in Ireland and will be subject to a 10% import charge. PepsiCo By Mark Mwachiro We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . PepsiCo indicated that it will likely see lower earnings in 2025 due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs and consumers’ changing spending habits. The snacks and beverages maker had expected mid-single-digit percentage growth, but it lowered those expectations, with its prospects now aligning with its 2024 performance. PepsiCo relayed this news as part of its first-quarter-2025 results Thursday, with chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta noting that the “volatility and uncertainty” brought on by recent trade developments will result in a probable increase in supply chain costs. One example is the price of imported aluminum used in making soda cans, which was hit with a 25% tariff charge. The global tensions have caused ripple effects for PepsiCo, with certain international markets reporting lower sales. Another way the tariffs impact PepsiCo is that the concentrate for its Pepsi and Mountain Dew drinks is made in Ireland and will be subject to a 10% import charge. However, PepsiCo’s archrival, Coca-Cola , is sitting pretty in this trade war, as it makes most of its concentrate for its soft drink products locally in Atlanta and Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, thereby avoiding additional production costs. According to ABC News , PepsiCo noted that its earnings have been affected by consumers voting with their wallets due to years of price increases. They have either pulled back on purchasing its products—which include Gatorade and Doritos snacks—and/or switched to healthier options. For the first quarter, PepsiCo reported $17.9 billion in net revenue, a drop of 1.8% from the previous quarter.

Agencies EXCLUSIVE: ‘You Threw Gasoline on the Fire’: Madwell CEO Lashes Out at Unpaid Employees Internal communications obtained by ADWEEK reveal CEO Christopher Sojka has turned on staffers who want answers for lack of payment Madwell, Getty Images By Kendra Barnett We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters . The CEO of Brooklyn-based creative shop Madwell, Christopher Sojka, is lashing out against distressed employees—according to internal communications obtained by ADWEEK—for pushing back against the agency’s in-office policies after not being paid on time, and for speaking to the press about the company’s financial woes. The indie shop, which has serviced major brands including Verizon and e.l.f. Cosmetics , is reportedly grappling with severe financial distress. “I will not flex more.” A current employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, told ADWEEK that Madwell leadership has been cruel in their dealings with employees whose pay is delayed. When employees raised concerns about their financial situation, the source said, they were often met with condescension. Sojka instead has pressured New York employees to abide by its policy of mandatory office attendance from Tuesday through Thursday each week, according to Slack messages obtained by ADWEEK, even as employees urged leadership to be more empathetic at a time when many staffers are under financial stress due to this payroll mishap.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Local Roots. Real Results. David Diaz isn’t a politician—he’s one of us. He was born at Jacobi Hospital , raised in Eastchester Gardens and Throggs Neck , and built his life in the Bronx. He’s lived the struggles of working families firsthand. As a small business owner, community advocate, and single father , he understands what it means to work hard, make ends meet, and fight for a better future. While others in politics have come and gone, David has been here— listening, organizing, and standing up for his neighbors. His story isn’t about titles or power—it’s about a deep-rooted commitment to the community that shaped him. A Life of Action, Not Politics David’s leadership started where it matters most: on the ground. ✔ Fighting Food Insecurity – When the pandemic hit, David stepped up. He delivered groceries to struggling families, ensuring no one in his community went hungry. ✔ Supporting Small Businesses – As a business owner, David has firsthand experience with the red tape that holds entrepreneurs back. He’s fought to cut through bureaucracy, advocate for relief programs, and support local businesses so they can thrive. ✔ Serving on Community Board 10 – Tackling issues like housing, transportation, and public safety , David has worked side by side with residents to find real solutions. ✔ Keeping Our Streets Clean & Safe – From leading neighborhood cleanups to advocating for better lighting, security, and crime prevention programs , David has always taken action— not for credit, but because it needed to be done. Why David is Running For too long, District 13 has been treated like an afterthought. Our leaders show up for photo ops but disappear when it’s time to do the real work. Our streets don’t feel safe, our schools are underfunded, and families are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. David Diaz is running because he’s had enough—and so have we. This campaign isn’t about politics. It’s about people. It’s about making sure that the Bronx finally gets the respect, resources, and representation it deserves. It’s about turning frustration into action. David is ready to take his lifetime of community leadership to City Hall, where he’ll fight for: ✔ Safer Streets – Community policing, better infrastructure, and real crime prevention. ✔ Stronger Schools – More funding, modern classrooms, and better opportunities for kids. ✔ Thriving Small Businesses – Less red tape, lower costs, and more support for local entrepreneurs. ✔ A Cleaner, Greener Bronx – Flood prevention, cleaner streets, and real environmental justice.
