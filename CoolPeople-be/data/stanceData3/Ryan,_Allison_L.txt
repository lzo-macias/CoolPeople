She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets.

AFP PHOTO/William PHILPOTT (Photo by WILLIAM PHILPOTT / AFP) (Photo by WILLIAM PHILPOTT/AFP via Getty Images). Photo: WILLIAM PHILPOTT/AFP via Getty The new FX series Impeachment: American Crime Story , which premiered Tuesday, retells the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. It puts a spotlight on the friendship — and ultimate falling-out — between Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky , whom Tripp secretly recorded as they discussed the affair. While Tripp's actions are still shown as a betrayal in Lewinsky's eyes, her own perspective gets significant airtime. Her daughter told Vanity Fair in a new interview that she thinks Tripp would have been "blown away" by the show and Sarah Paulson 's acting abilities. "I can [imagine] my mother's reactions in my head. To be perfectly honest, I think she would be blown away by that episode and how they portrayed her…she always said that the truth eventually does come out," Allison Tripp Foley said, adding: "This episode portrayed her—it's sad to say—but in a more flattering way than how she was portrayed when she was alive," Foley, a real estate agent and buyer for her late mother's Christmas store, added that Paulson's performance, in particular, was impressive. "I have to say—and I'm only limited to the one episode that I've seen—but I do think Sarah did a good job," Foley told the magazine via Zoom. "Of course there were some inaccuracies I see as her daughter [but] ... She captured a lot of my mom—just how smart and witty she was…. I had to laugh at a couple of lines because that's how she got through the pain … the show did a good job digging deep to find out truly how she ticked." Sarah Paulson (left), Linda Tripp. Tina Thorpe/FX; Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Foley was just a teenager when her mother, then a Pentagon employee and lifelong civil servant, made secret audio tapes of Lewinsky detailing her affair with the president. She ultimately turned the recordings over to investigators, fueling BillClinton 's 1998 impeachment. Tripp, who insisted she was acting as a whistleblower and not out of partisanship, was granted immunity. But she faced plenty of criticism for how she treated Lewinsky — and she became an object of ridicule for her looks (John Goodman played her on Saturday Night Live ). "There are people who think I'm a hero, and there are people who think I'm a villain," she told PEOPLE in 2003. "And I'm neither." She ultimately resettled away from Washington, D.C., marrying for a second time (and becoming Linda Tripp Rausch), moving to a farm and undergoing expensive plastic surgery to live in relative anonymity. "I think she felt compelled to soften her appearance," Foley — who stood behind her mother as Tripp spoke to the press in 1998 following her testimony before the federal grand jury — told Vanity Fair . "Because it was always just one jagged, unflattering photo after the next." "They had plenty of good photography to choose from, yet they continued to revert back to just the worst photos," Foley said. "At the time, the messaging was, 'Get over it, [the criticism] is not a big deal.' But it is a big deal. That criticism would not be allowed today." The Bond and Bad Blood Between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp — Secret Tapes, Codenames and That Blue Dress Tripp died in 2020 , at age 70, after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphoma. In a since-deleted Facebook post, Foley wrote at the time: "My mommy is leaving this earth. I don't know myself if I can survive this heartache. Please pray for a painless process for the strongest woman I will ever know in my entire lifetime." As she told Vanity Fair , Foley has since lost both her father and her grandfather, making the past year one of grief and mourning (compounded, she said, by hateful messages that rolled in with the death of her mother). "Last year it was just surreal with the emotions of everything and the pandemic on top of that," Foley told VF . "I think all of this has hit me this year, allowing me to truly be able to mourn fully." Though her mom's public persona was defined by the scandal, Foley said her own formative years weren't (though she did tell VF she remembered her mom fielding phone calls from Lewinsky during a family vacation to Lake Placid). "I didn't ask questions and neither did my brother because, again with her, I always knew the path that she would take was the path that would do the right thing," Foley told the magazine. Facebook Beanie Feldstein Hopes People See Monica Lewinsky in a 'Different Light' After Impeachment: ACS Now, after her mother's death and with the debut of the series on FX, Foley is quick to defend Tripp's choices. "She didn't want to perjure herself. It wasn't ever about writing a book. It wasn't ever about cashing out. It was never about selling those tapes," Foley said. (In her last comments to PEOPLE, in 2017, Tripp suggested much the same: that she had been caricatured as the "true villain" in a way that distorted her motives.) Foley told VF it was about a sense of duty to the country — and, in her view, an instinct to protect her younger friend. "She saw a little bit of self-destruction going on with Monica," Foley said. "And unfortunately, people have to kind of make their own mistakes in life, right?"

"Hillary says I've always been our family's Christmas elf," the 75-year-old former president tells PEOPLE during an interview about his new video lecture series with MasterClass. This year, Clinton and his wife — former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — will continue a tradition of decamping from their Chappaqua, New York, home to spend the holiday in New York City with daughter Chelsea , her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their three children: Charlotte, Aidan and Jasper. "We always go down on Christmas Eve, spend the night and have Christmas Day with them," Clinton says. "And I think it's the right thing to do, intergenerationally. And then we normally go to the train display at the Bronx Zoo. It's great." Bill Clinton Shares Secrets of North Korea Talks in New MasterClass, Reacts to FX Impeachment Series The holiday season has long been a special time for the Clintons. Hillary, her husband says, took special pride in how the family tree (kept on display in the upstairs residence) was decorated when the two lived at the White House. "Even when we were in the White House, and they have that huge Christmas tree, she took responsibility every year for how it would be decorated and what we would do at Christmas," he says. "One of the most valuable things that came out of that was her effort to get American artists and craftspeople to contribute to Christmas." Bill (left) and Hillary Clinton.

Tommy joined PEOPLE in 2022. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 7, 2022 10:27AM EDT As far as crazy family-vacation stories go, Hillary Clinton may have many people beat. On Tuesday, Hillary, 74, and Chelsea Clinton appeared on The Tonight Show for a mother-daughter question challenge . Host Jimmy Fallon asked the former secretary of state and former first daughter, 42, questions one at a time while the other wore noise-cancelling headphones to determine whether they'd each share the same answer. After a revelation that "Moon River," from the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's , may be the only song Hillary knows how to sing, Chelsea donned noise-cancelling headphones and tuned out as Fallon, 47, asked Hillary for the Clinton family's "craziest family vacation memory." "We had a lot of crazy times. ... I hope she doesn't remember this because it was pretty traumatic," Hillary told Fallon. "We took [Chelsea] to Russia when we went on a state visit when Bill [Clinton] was president, and there's the formal goodbye, so Bill and I were ushered into the Beast, the big limousine, to head to the airport, not knowing we had left her behind."

"That was a long answer," Chelsea said as Fallon instructed her to take the headphones off and answer the question for herself. "Gosh, now I wish we had been chased by a bear or something," Chelsea said, prompting Fallon to simply reply, "Close … " After Chelsea appeared to prod the audience's collective tone — she noted that the group appeared to share "a lot of shock" after hearing Hillary's story — the former first daughter correctly guessed the answer, revealing she does remember being temporarily left behind. Chelsea and Hillary Clinton. Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Hillary Clinton Says She Started Wearing Pantsuits After "Suggestive" Photos Came Out in Brazil On Tuesday, Hillary also took to Twitter to refute resurfaced allegations about her email correspondence while she served as secretary of state in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. "I can't believe we're still talking about this, but my emails … " she tweeted. "As Trump's problems continue to mount, the right is trying to make this about me again. There's even a 'Clinton Standard.' The fact is that I had zero emails that were classified." In another tweet, the longtime politician said, "I'm more tired of talking about this than anyone, but here we are" — then directed her followers, or those who questioned her record, to read a story published Saturday in The National Memo which featured the headline "How Many of 'Her Emails' Were Classified? Actually, Zero." A lengthy FBI investigation ultimately determined that Hillary's email server did not contain any classified information.

Bush Visit Ukrainian Church Together “In the spirit of seeing every American come together, it just made all the sense in the world to them,” spokesmen for Clinton and Bush said in a joint statement to PEOPLE By Olivia Jakiel Olivia Jakiel Olivia Jakiel is a former associate editor at PEOPLE. She left PEOPLE in 2022. People Editorial Guidelines Published on March 18, 2022 08:55PM EDT Photo: Rick Kern/Getty Bill Clinton and George W. Bush put on a united front as they visited a Ukrainian church in Chicago this week. The former presidents were in the Windy City for a joint speaking gig on Wednesday when they decided, spur of the moment, to stop in Chicago's neighborhood known as Ukrainian Village, which is home to the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, Ukrainian Cultural Center, and the city's vibrant Ukrainian-American community. In a joint statement to PEOPLE, spokesmen for the two former presidents said: "In the spirit of seeing every American come together, it just made all the sense in the world to them." Bush and Clinton, both 75, donned blue and yellow ribbons on their jacket lapels as they walked side by side, placing bouquets of sunflowers – Ukraine's national flower – from a local Ukrainian florist at the feet of a stone cross outside the golden-domed Saints Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church. Obama, Bush and Clinton Reunite to Note Importance of 'Peaceful Transfer of Power' as They Wish Biden Luck Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE 's free weekly newsletter to get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday. "America stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they fight for their freedom and their future," Bush said on Instagram, where he posted a video and photos of the visit. Clinton also posted the video to his Twitter page, writing, "America stands united with the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom and against oppression."

Millions of Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations says. The invasion, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin , has drawn condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia. With NATO forces massing in the region around Ukraine, various countries have also pledged aid or military support to the resistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for peace talks — so far unsuccessful — while urging his country to fight back. "Nobody is going to break us, we're strong, we're Ukrainians," he told the European Union in a speech in the early days of the fighting, adding, "Life will win over death. And light will win over darkness." The Russian attack on Ukraine is an evolving story, with information changing quickly.

He left PEOPLE in 2023. People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 14, 2022 01:56PM EST Photo: Hillary Clinton/Twitter Hillary Clinton is beaming next to husband Bill Clinton in an old photo she shared on Twitter on Monday. "Happy Valentine's Day!" the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee wrote — adding double-heart emoji — to caption the throwback pic of the young couple, who've been married since Oct. 11, 1975. Former President Clinton had his own memory to share on social media, posting a photo of the two dancing from 1982. Their love story, despite its famous challenges, stretches back to their days as Yale University law students in the early 1970s. "In the spring of 1971, I met a girl," the former president said of crossing paths with Hillary Rodham more than five decades ago. "The first time I saw her we were, appropriately enough, in a class on political and civil rights. She had thick blond hair, big glasses, wore no makeup, and she had a sense of strength and self- possession that I found magnetic," the former president said in his speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention , where his wife received her historic nomination. "After the class I followed her out, intending to introduce myself. I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn't do it. Somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop." Bill Clinton Hopes Hillary's Emotional Reading of Victory Speech 'Will Make People a Little Less Cynical' The former first lady told her version of when sparks flew in 2016 : "I first saw him, I was walking through the student lounge and I heard this voice saying to a group of people, '… and not only that but we grow the biggest watermelons in the world.' And I said, 'Who is that?' And somebody said, 'That's Bill Clinton. He's from Arkansas; that's all he ever talks about.' " When eyes met one day among the law library book stacks, she approached him. Hillary Clinton 'Delighted' to Receive Honorary Degree from Oxford "She walked the whole length of the library, came up to me and said, 'Look, if you're going to keep staring at me and now I'm staring back, we at least ought to know each other's name. I'm Hillary Rodham, who are you?' " he recalled in his 2016 speech. "I was so impressed and surprised that, whether you believe it or not, momentarily I was speechless." Their first date was a stroll across campus that ended with their first kiss outside her dorm. "We just started walking around, New Haven, Connecticut, and we spent hours together, we went to a museum, we went to dinner, we just went on and on," she said in 2016. Bruce Glikas/WireImage "We've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since," the president said in his speech decades later. "We've done it in good times and bad, through joy and heartbreak." Kim Kardashian Visits L.A. Coffee Shop with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton After a sex scandal erupted (and not the first) over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and led to his impeachment, President Clinton wrote of his wife as a salve as they emerged from the deeply embarrassing episode that rocked their relationship and his administration.

This includes managing the vertical's tentpoles, running lead on the Met Gala, which is among PEOPLE.com 's top-trafficked red carpet events every year, interviewing the industry's top celebrities and tastemakers and breaking A-list celeb news (a New Jersey shore native, it is no surprise that her favorite interview ever was with Bruce Springsteen). Brittany has represented the brand on national TV programs including Good Morning America and The CW's two TV specials on the British Royals. You may also see her on one of PEOPLE's green screen social media videos decoding Taylor Swift's style. She joined PEOPLE from Cosmopolitan in 2013, where she was an Associate Editor. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on March 15, 2025 02:04PM EDT Comments Ariana Madix's Sunny Outlook Ariana Madix Has So Moved on from All That – Inside Her New Reality, Relationship and What’s Next Editor's Letter It's fitting that the Spring 2025 issue of People StyleWatch is my first in my new role as Style and Beauty Director. After all, spring is the season of transformation and growth and this position marks the next chapter of my career. That’s why I was thrilled to have someone else stepping into the next phase of their life on the cover of this issue.

"For so many years I was afraid to go too far, do too much, and now I feel like it’s so much more fun for me,” she says of her style. “It’s like costumes in a way, getting to kind of channel characters, and it’s really fun.” For her PSW shoot, styled by Emily Men , Madix channels L.A. cool girl in some of the biggest seasonal trends, like butter yellow (if you’re looking for a splurge, her Jacquemus dress is on sale !), powder blue, rugby shirts and sheer fabrics. “F--- flattering, wear something fun, wear what you like!,” she says of her overall fashion philosophy. My 3-year-old daughter has that same unapologetic sense of style: Her commitment to princess-core is truly unmatched.

She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets. People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 19, 2022 01:32PM EDT Hillary and Bill Clinton in January 2018. Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Former President Bill Clinton turned 76 on Friday, and he's celebrating in style — spending time in Long Island with family and responding to well-wishes from friends. "He's been going through texts, calls, and all the well-wishes from his friends and family, including his longtime friends Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson, Mick Jagger, Quincy Jones, and The Edge," a source tells PEOPLE. His wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , took to social media Friday to share a throwback photo in honor of her husband's milestone. "Happy Birthday, @BillClinton," the former first lady, 74, wrote on Twitter, along with a photo of her, Bill, and their daughter Chelsea. Chelsea also got in on the fun, sharing her own message to her dad—along with another vintage photo—on Twitter. "Happy Birthday Dad! Looking forward to sharing happy memories (& cake!) with you for many years to come!" Chelsea wrote, alongside a black-and-white image of her father cutting a birthday cake in his younger days. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush Visit Ukrainian Church Together It's something of annual tradition for the Clintons to mark the former president's birthday with a throwback photo. In 2019, the former first lady reached deep into the family vault , posting a black-and-white shot of a young Clinton wearing a romper and sandals. In 2015, she celebrated him turning 69 with a black-and-white photo of the two looking lovingly into each others' eyes early in their romance. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The former president, a Democrat who left office in Jan. 2001, has in recent months used most of his public appearances to speak out about the importance of bipartisanship. Appearing as a guest on The Late Late Show with James Corden in June, he spoke candidly about the gun problem plaguing the country. "Don't be afraid to talk to people, and don't talk down to them. ... Assume that they got good sense and they're afraid of losing what they got," Clinton said. "And instead of telling them that they're dumb [because] they don't agree with you, ask for their help." "We need to just talk to each other again," Clinton added to Corden, 43. Clinton has also made public appearances with other former presidents, including George W. Bush , who accompanied him to a Ukrainian church in Chicago in March. The former presidents were in the Windy City for a joint speaking gig on Wednesday when they decided, spur of the moment, to stop in Chicago's neighborhood known as Ukrainian Village, which is home to the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, Ukrainian Cultural Center, and the city's vibrant Ukrainian-American community. In a joint statement to PEOPLE, spokesmen for the two former presidents said: "In the spirit of seeing every American come together, it just made all the sense in the world to them."

He joined the publication on the crime beat. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 5, 2024 11:51AM EST Former President Bill Clinton. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty A former Vanity Fair reporter is coming to Bill Clinton 's defense after an allegation surfaced that the former president once threatened the magazine to kill its exposés on Jeffrey Epstein 's sex trafficking ring. A second batch of Epstein-related court documents unsealed Thursday night includes a 2011 email from alleged Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre , in which she wrote to a friend that she was nervous about Vanity Fair 's handling of her story "considering that B. Clinton walked into VF and threatened them not to write sex-trafficing [sic] articles about his good friend J.E." Asked about the email on CNN This Morning on Friday, former Vanity Fair contributing editor Vicky Ward — who was tasked with profiling Epstein for the magazine two decades ago — said she believes Giuffre may have jumbled the details. “I never heard that that happened," she told CNN's Phil Mattingly and Audie Cornish. "What I wonder is if Virginia [Giuffre] is hearing gossip and getting it slightly wrong." Epstein Files Unsealed: Prince Andrew Accused of Groping Woman's Breast, and More Names and Allegations Ward explained that when she was asked to write about Epstein's finances in 2002, she ended up hearing from two sisters, Maria and Annie Farmer, who claimed they were abused by him. "When Jeffrey Epstein realized that I was in possession of their allegations, he appeared in the offices of Vanity Fair ," Ward said. "I knew about this because the fact checker who was fact-checking my piece at the time sent me an email saying, ‘Oh my god he's standing here in the office.’ And I've said before the Farmers’ allegations were suddenly cut from the piece that was ultimately published." Ward never heard of Clinton taking similar actions to quash her reporting, saying, "I suspect that some version of the story I've just told you probably reached its way to [Giuffre] and that might be what she's referring to.” Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Virginia Giuffre Is 'Holding Prince Andrew Accountable' with Lawsuit Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Clinton — whose foundation partnered with Epstein in the early '00s — has not been linked to any crimes committed by the wealthy financier, but his documented travel on Epstein's plane has long raised questions about their relationship. Jeffrey Epstein Allegedly Told Victim That Bill Clinton 'Likes Them Young,' According to Unsealed Docs Clinton did not object to having this week's Epstein-related court documents unsealed. In a statement to PEOPLE earlier this week, his spokesperson said "it's been nearly 20 years since President Clinton last had contact with Epstein." The spokesperson referred PEOPLE to his 2019 statement that reads, in part, "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes" committed by Epstein. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges; his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell , was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021.

Knopf has announced that the former president’s memoir will be published later this year. Citizen: My Life After the White House will arrive in November. “A life in public service can be deeply rewarding if you accept that in the constant ebb and flow of history, there are no permanent victories or defeats, and never forget that every life is a story that, regardless of time and circumstance, deserves to be seen and heard,” Clinton says in a statement shared with PEOPLE. 'Citizen: My Life After the White House' by Bill Clinton. Alfred A. Knopf “ Citizen is the story of my 23-plus years since leaving the White House, told largely through the stories of other people who changed my life as I tried to help change theirs, of those who supported me, including those I loved and lost and of the mistakes I made along the way,” he continues. Inside Bill Clinton's Pandemic Year: Bingeing 'Bridgerton', Dusting Off His Sax & Writing Thriller The new book will chronicle both the personal and political aspects of Clinton’s life following his two terms as president, which he served from 1993 to 2001, as well as some of the 21st century’s most crucial moments, such as the Iraq war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6th insurrection.

Kennedy , died at age 96 on Oct. 10 from complications related to a stroke. After her husband’s assassination in 1968, she dedicated herself to raising their 11 children and devoted her life to public service and human rights. “Along with a lifetime’s work in social justice and human rights, our mother leaves behind nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-great-grandchildren, along with numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom love her dearly,” the family statement said in announcing her death.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Among the many distinguished guests at Ethel's celebration of life were three United States presidents: Joe Biden , Barack Obama and Bill Clinton . "Her life was marked by more tragedy and heartbreak than most of us could bear," Obama said during his eulogy. "And she would have been forgiven, I think, if at any point she had stepped away from public life or allowed bitterness to fester after all she and her family had been through. But that's not what Ethel did because that's not who she was." Obama called Ethel "a big dose in a small package," contrasting her "spitfire" personality to RFK's more "shy and serious" demeanor. "I thought your mother was the cat's meow. She would flirt with me in the most innocent ways," Clinton playfully told Ethel's children. "She was an amazing fireball of continuous energy. It was wonderful to be around her." Ethel Kennedy and RFK Were Married for 18 Years. Here's the Story of Their Romance — and Why She Never Remarried After His Death Biden, whose eulogy closed out the service, said that Ethel was there for him at the very start of his career, when his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident after he had just been elected to the Senate. "Along with Teddy [Kennedy], she got me through a time I didn't want to stick around. I wanted no part of being in the Congress or the Senate, I mean it," Biden said, reflecting on the difficulty he faced in launching his political career in a time of grief. "But Teddy and Ethel wanted to hear none of it. You know the fact is, like she did for the country, Ethel helped my family find a way forward with principle and purpose." And throughout his time in public service, Biden said, she always remained a friend. "There was nothing, from my perspective — and I suspect most of you — that she couldn't do," he said. "Nothing."

Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Other political power players appeared at the service as well, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom , former Secretary of State John Kerry and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the latter of whom called Ethel a "national treasure" on stage. Martin Luther King III , son of MLK Jr. , spoke about his family's ties to the Kennedys. "I remember when Mrs. Kennedy came to our home with Sen. Kennedy in 1968 after my father was assassinated. That was the first time I remember meeting Mrs. Kennedy," King, 66, said. "And just two months later, my mom went to the Kennedy home to express her condolences after the assassination of Sen. Robert Kennedy." He continued: "Like millions of Americans I was deeply moved and profoundly impressed by the remarkable courage and dignity Mrs. Kennedy displayed in the days after her beloved husband Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated." Martin Luther King III at the memorial service for Ethel Kennedy on Oct. 16, 2024.

A handful of Ethel's children — who called her "Mummy" — also played prominent roles in the service, including Kathleen, Kerry, Max and Rory. "Mummy was all I had, but she was more than I could have ever hoped for," said Rory, who was born after RFK's assassination. "She was my staunchest advocate." "We have been lucky, Mummy, because we have lived so long with you, who had been in love all of those years with Daddy," Kathleen, the oldest daughter of Ethel and Bobby, said. "We expect you will have heaven much better decorated before the holidays, and we’re comforted that you will always find a place for us at that table."

She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets. People Editorial Guidelines Published on November 30, 2022 03:06PM EST Photo: Noam Galai/Getty Images Bill Clinton has come down with COVID-19 but is "doing fine overall," according to a tweet he posted Wednesday. "I've tested positive for Covid. I've had mild symptoms, but I'm doing fine overall and keeping myself busy at home," 76-year-old Clinton wrote in the post . "I'm grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, which has kept my case mild, and I urge everyone to do the same, especially as we move into the winter months." Clinton's COVID diagnosis comes just over a year after the former president was released from the hospital after several days following treatment for a non-COVID-related infection . Last October, Clinton was in California to conduct Clinton Foundation business when he felt "fatigued" and headed to the hospital, a source previously told PEOPLE. There, he was diagnosed with a urological infection, which morphed into a broader infection, and led him to be under doctors' care at UCI Medical Center. "He's up and about, joking and charming the hospital staff," the source later said of Clinton's status. Hillary Clinton Tests Positive for COVID: 'I've Got Some Mild Cold Symptoms But Am Feeling Fine' Clinton's wife, Sec. Hillary Clinton , tested positive for COVID-19 in March. "Well, I've tested positive for COVID. I've got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine," the former first lady and secretary of state, 75, wrote on Twitter that month. "I'm more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already!" "Bill tested negative and is feeling fine. He's quarantining until our household is fully in the clear," she added in a follow-up tweet. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. Both of the Clintons were among the presidents and first ladies to appear in an ad urging Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine in March 2021. In December 2020, former President Clinton said he would volunteer to take the vaccine publicly in order to prove its safety to the American public. "President Clinton will definitely take a vaccine as soon as available to him, based on the priorities determined by public health officials. And he will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same," Clinton's spokesperson, Angel Ureña, said in a statement to PEOPLE at the time.

Entertainment Music Rap & Hip Hop Fat Joe Gifts Former President Bill Clinton a ‘Special Delivery’ of New Shoes — Watch the Sweet Exchange The rapper presents Clinton with a pair of his Terror Squad x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers at an event By David Chiu David Chiu David Chiu is a staff writer, Human Interest, for PEOPLE. A former PEOPLE intern from 2007 to 2008, he has been writing about news and entertainment for over 10 years. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 20, 2023 12:01PM EDT (L-R) Fat Joe and Bill Clinton. Photo: Bennett Raglin/Getty, Slaven Vlasic/Getty Fat Joe , whose real name is Joseph Antonio Cartagena, not only had an opportunity to meet and pay tribute to a former U.S. president, he also offered him a fly present. The "Lean Back" rapper, 53, hung out with Bill Clinton at a recent Clinton Foundation event, Complex reported. In a video that he shared Tuesday on Instagram , Joe told Clinton that he had a "special delivery" for him. He then took out a pair of his Terror Squad x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers and presented them to Clinton. The former president responded, "Wow!" Joe captioned his post, “MAIL MAN AT IT AGAIN TSAF1 Billllll." When asked by someone if Clinton is now an honorary member of the Terror Squad — which is the name of the New York City rap act that included Joe and the late rapper Big Pun — Joe responded: “He’s an honorary member of the [Terror] Squad.” The rapper also told Clinton how much appreciation he has for him in the video. “But I love you so much," he said. "So many years you fought for the people. We love you. I’m a huge fan of yours. Thank you so much for what you did for us, but the mailman delivers.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

The "Blackout" Terror Squad x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers went on sale this past Saturday and have been sold out. In a BET interview, Joe, a longtime sneaker collector, spoke about the collaboration with Nike. “It’s a dream come true," he said. "I haven’t allowed myself to cry yet. I know for a fact that anytime I put myself in a bathroom or something with the sneaker and I really think about it, I’m crying. So I’m happy, I’m honored that Nike chose to partner up with me. And hey, it’s the fly sneaker in the game right now.” Nike Unveils New Kobe Bryant 8 Protro Sneaker Designed by Vanessa Bryant Meanwhile, Joe recently spoke to Men’s Health about his health, specifically about losing 200 lbs. after being at 470 lbs. at his heaviest. He realized he had to do something about his weight after he attended the funeral of Big Pun, who died in 2000 of a heart attack in his 20s. “I went to his funeral and I felt like Ebenezer Scrooge,” Joe said in the interview.  “And I’m looking at his little daughter. She was the same age as my daughter. I said, ‘You gotta lose weight; otherwise you outta here.'" He also revealed that changing his habits helped him confront his depression. "Once you snap out of it, you should know what brings you there and to run the other way,” the rapper said. “The minute I feel unhappy, I go toward happy."

Photo: Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Turkey pardoning is a tradition that is as American as apple pie . While families across the nation prepare for hearty Thanksgiving feasts , U.S. Presidents — dating back to Abraham Lincoln — have made an event of granting clemency to a selection of lucky birds. From Purdue Pete to Flyer to Peach and Blossom, see U.S. Presidents with the turkeys they've pardoned throughout the years. 01 of 17 Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1960 Dwight D. Eisenhower with a turkey. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum/NARA According to the White House , the tradition of granting clemency to a turkey dates back to 1863, when Abraham Lincoln apparently pardoned one. Poultry dealers had been sending birds to the White House for years before that, however, no one had ever formerly excused one from their Thanksgiving table. Fast-forward several decades, when people claimed Harry S. Truman officially began the tradition — a fact his library and museum staff disputes. Though he was pictured with one at his time — and mentioned it'd come in handy at Christmas time — it was Eisenhower who posed for this photo op of himself feeding a turkey a cranberry during his term. 02 of 17 John F. Kennedy, 1963 John F. Kennedy and a turkey. Keystone-FranceGamma-Rapho/Getty The Washington Post first used both "pardon" and "reprieve" in a 1963 article in which President Kennedy said of his turkey, "Let's keep him going," the White House shared. 03 of 17 Lyndon B. Johnson, 1967 Lyndon B. Johnson and a turkey. Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum/NARA After Kennedy's assassination, Johnson took over the tradition. Here, Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois and representatives of the poultry industry and farm organizations presented the president with the year's turkey. 04 of 17 Richard Nixon, 1970 Richard Nixon and a turkey. Keystone-FranceGamma-Rapho/Getty A possibly apocryphal tale about Nixon's photo op with his turkey claims the bird was so rattled, its feet had to be nailed to the table. (Apparently turkeys don't have nerve endings in their feet.) 05 of 17 Gerald Ford, 1975 Gerald Ford and a turkey. Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum/NARA Unclear if the bird directly in front of the president was for eating or decoration. The live one traveled to D.C. with the National Turkey Federation. 06 of 17 Jimmy Carter, 1978 Rosalynn Carter with a turkey. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum/NARA The president's wife, Rosalynn, and daughter, Amy, took over the honors in this year, meeting with "Purdue Pete" on the North Portico of the White House. 07 of 17 Ronald Reagan, 1985 Ronald Reagan with a turkey. Dirck Halstead/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Reagan's expression of glee was no doubt due to the fact that this encounter went markedly better than his first with a turkey, when the bird went wild on him , fluttering around madly until handlers could placate it. Reagan is credited with making the turkey pardoning an official act, formalizing the annual process. 08 of 17 George H.W. Bush, 1989 George H.W. Bush with a turkey. Diana Walker/Time Life Pictures/Getty Bush reportedly quipped "reprieve," within earshot of animal rights activists picketing the ceremony. 09 of 17 Bill Clinton, 2000 Bill Clinton and a turkey. Mario Tama/AFP/Getty Clinton's turkey's name was "Jerry," which we have to assume was a Seinfeld reference, given the show's dominance throughout the '90s. 10 of 17 George W. Bush, 2006 George W. Bush and a turkey. Tim Sloan/AFP/Getty Bush II's bird's name was "Flyer," though he looks like more of a "Grumpy," right? 11 of 17 Barack Obama, 2012 Barack Obama and a turkey. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty For his official duties in 2012, Obama brought along daughters Sasha and Malia, a job they helped with pretty much every year their dad was in office. 12 of 17 Barack Obama, 2015 Barack Obama and a turkey. Chip Somodevilla/Getty President Obama is seen here with Abe, the 42-lb. turkey he pardoned on Nov. 25, 2015. Careful readers will note that some believe the practice of pardoning a turkey started with Abraham Lincoln, which brings this whole event full circle. 13 of 17 Donald Trump, 2020 Donald Trump and a turkey. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump was able to keep up with the tradition in 2020, granting a pardon to Corn, who lost a Twitter poll for the privilege to his pal, Cob. 14 of 17 Joe Biden, 2021 Joe Biden and a turkey. OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Though traditionally two turkeys come to Washington, D.C., and just one is pardoned while the other serves as 'alternate,' in 2021, President Joe Biden granted clemency to both . Indiana natives Peanut Butter and Jelly were selected because of their "temperament, appearance and I suspect their vaccination status," the president joked. "Instead of getting basted, they're getting boosted." 15 of 17 Joe Biden, 2022 Joe Biden and a turkey. SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Biden repeated his two-turkey tradition in 2022 , handing the mic to either Chocolate or Chip — birds named for the president's favorite ice cream flavor. This marked the 75th anniversary of the turkey pardoning tradition, and Biden leaned into the puns in celebration. "Before I gobble up too much time, the votes are in," Biden said, making a nod to the recent midterm elections. "They've been counted, verified. There's no ballot stuffing. There's no 'fowl' play. The only red wave this season is gonna be German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce on the table." 16 of 17 Joe Biden, 2023 Joe Biden and a turkey. Win McNamee/Getty For 2023, it was turkeys Liberty and Bell who got their moment in the spotlight as they were chosen to be pardoned by President Joe Biden. In a ceremony held on the South Lawn on Nov. 20, Biden celebrated the occasion, saying, "this is their day" of the two birds, who were raised in Willmar, Minnesota. Just like in years past, the two turkeys spent the previous night at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., arriving on a red carpet before being escorted to their rooms. "This is the 76th anniversary of this event," the President said. "I want you to know I wasn't there at the first one. I was too young to make it up," he joked, taking a jab at the fact that he turned 81 on the same day . 17 of 17 Joe Biden, 2024 Presidents Joe Biden with chair of the National Turkey Federation John Zimmerman and his son Grant. Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty For his last Thanksgiving as president, Joe Biden showed clemency to turkeys Peach and Blossom, who were named after the official flower of his home state of Delaware.

This marked the 75th anniversary of the turkey pardoning tradition, and Biden leaned into the puns in celebration. "Before I gobble up too much time, the votes are in," Biden said, making a nod to the recent midterm elections. "They've been counted, verified. There's no ballot stuffing. There's no 'fowl' play. The only red wave this season is gonna be German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce on the table." 16 of 17  Joe Biden, 2023 Joe Biden, 2023 Joe Biden and a turkey.

In a ceremony held on the South Lawn on Nov. 20, Biden celebrated the occasion, saying, "this is their day" of the two birds, who were raised in Willmar, Minnesota. Just like in years past, the two turkeys spent the previous night at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., arriving on a red carpet before being escorted to their rooms. "This is the 76th anniversary of this event," the President said. "I want you to know I wasn't there at the first one. I was too young to make it up," he joked, taking a jab at the fact that he turned 81 on the same day . 17 of 17  Joe Biden, 2024 Joe Biden, 2024 Presidents Joe Biden with chair of the National Turkey Federation John Zimmerman and his son Grant.

Celebrity Celebrity Belief & Identity Celebrity Social Issues Hillary Clinton Says She's Never Watched a TV or Film Adaptation About Her Family: 'I've Lived It' "There's no reason to watch it," Hillary Clinton said Thursday on Watch What Happens Live of not seeing any TV or film adaptations about her family By Giovana Gelhoren Giovana Gelhoren Giovana Gelhoren is a former digital news writer at PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 9, 2022 09:51AM EDT Hillary Clinton is not pleading the fifth. While appearing on Watch What Happens Live with daughter Chelsea on Thursday, the former secretary of state, 74, participated in Andy Cohen 's segment titled Plead the Fifth — where guests can choose to not answer one of the three questions asked — and she didn't hold back. In one of the questions, the host, 54, asked if she's ever seen any TV show or movie based on her family's life, including 1998's Primary Colors and FX's Impeachment: American Crime Story . "I have not watched any of them," the former first lady said, adding with a laugh, "I've lived it. There's no reason to watch it." Hillary was also asked which senator is the most blowhard, to which she initially answered that there's "too many to count." After some thought, she said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz "is the eternal blowhard." Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Hillary Clinton Says She Once Accidentally Left Daughter Chelsea at the Kremlin: "Pretty Traumatic" Cohen also asked the politician about the "biggest gaffe" she's ever made in her career. And although she couldn't name a specific one, Hillary said, "When you've been in the public eye for as long as I have, you misspeak, you're tired, you say something that turns out to be a little bit off, so I just can't think of one that pops up." Luckily, Chelsea, 42, quickly jumped in. "There was the time when you were campaigning in Buffalo in 2000 for the Senate and she was asked to dance the Polish polka on stage," she recalled, saying that her mother, anticipating "a gaffe," quickly swerved on the offer. "To avoid making a gaffe, she turned to me and said, 'My daughter would love to do that,' " Chelsea said as the trio and audience all laughed. Also in the interview, Hillary received questions from fans, and one asked if saying "I told you so" ever crosses her mind given former President Donald Trump 's divisive administration. "It does cross my mind, honestly," she admitted, "but it doesn't provide any kind of solace to me." "I'm so distressed [about] everything that happened during the time that he was [in office] and then his refusal to accept the election and inciting violence, it's heartbreaking," Hillary added. "I don't care what political party you are, I hope people will just say, 'No, enough. We're not gonna let that kind of divisiveness and disruption exist in our country any longer.' " "It's so important to stop it," she said. Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton's New Gutsy Series Has an Episode on Hate. We Asked: Does She "Hate" Donald Trump? Recently, as part of her promo tour for her and Chelsea's new Apple TV+ docuseries Gutsy , the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee sat for an interview with CBS News anchor Norah O'Donnell , who raised the question, "Would you ever run for president again?" "No, no," Hillary answered without hesitation . "But I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we have a president that respects our democracy and the rule of law and upholds our institutions." That means, in her mind, that Trump, 76, should be "soundly defeated," Hillary added when O'Donnell, 48, asked about the former president, who has indicated he's likely to launch a third bid for the White House in 2024. "It should start in the Republican party," Hillary continued. "Grow a backbone. Stand up to this guy." She added, "And heaven forbid if he gets the nomination, he needs to be defeated soundly and sent back to Mar-a-Lago." Hillary Clinton; Donald Trump. Andreas Rentz/Getty; Brandon Bell/Getty Hillary Clinton Says Winning Next Election Is "Most Important Thing" but Running Herself Is "Out of Question" Hillary then praised the witnesses, including former Trump administration officials like Sarah Matthews and Cassidy Hutchinson , who testified publicly before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and the attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that Joe Biden won. "That goes to a point about being a gutsy woman," she told O'Donnell. "The couple of young women who have come forward out of the Trump White House, they have been vilified. They had to have known that they were going to be criticized. But I give them enormous credit for speaking the truth and doing the right thing." She also commended "gutsy" Congresswoman Liz Cheney , the Republican vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, for her "great, historic service to the United States" and for paying a steep price for her efforts to hold Trump accountable for his role in unsuccessful plans to subvert a free and fair election four years after he defeated Hillary in the 2016 presidential race. "One of the hallmarks of a real democracy is the peaceful transfer of power," she said during her interview with O'Donnell. "Was I happy when I beat Donald Trump by nearly 3 million votes but lost the Electoral College? No, I was not happy. Did I ever for a nanosecond think, 'I'm gonna claim victory and try to get the Democrats to refuse to certify the election?' No." Gutsy is now available on Apple TV+.

Entertainment Books Non-Fiction Books George Stephanopoulos' New Book Examines History's Biggest Decisions Made in the White House Situation Room The former White House adviser, host of ABC's "This Week" and co-anchor of "GMA" takes a deep-dive into presidential history in his newly announced book, "The Situation Room," publishing in May 2024 By People Staff Published on October 10, 2023 09:00AM EDT Photo: ROBERT GIROUX/AFP via Getty George Stephanopoulos is putting his White House expertise to use in a newly announced book, The Situation Room , publishing in the spring of 2024. The host of ABC's This Week and co-anchor of Good Morning America — who served as a senior adviser and White House communications director to President Bill Clinton — wrote the historical deep-dive to offer a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most secretive rooms in modern history. “Along with the Oval Office, no place better exemplifies the power and mystery of the presidency than the White House Situation Room,” Stephanopolous says. “The decisions made in that windowless warren in the basement of the West Wing have determined the fate of presidents and shaped the course of history, yet relatively little has been written about it and the people who work there — no comprehensive history in nearly two decades. When I discovered that fact, I knew I had to write this book.” From JFK's Assassination to Comey's Firing, Relive the Most Dramatic Political Moments in Recent U.S. History "The Situation Room," by George Stephanopoulos with Lisa Dickey. Grand Central Publishing Stephanopoulos' book runs through the high-stakes, out-of-view moments that have made and destroyed presidents' legacies, dating back to the situation room's creation under President John F. Kennedy . It features transcripts from the days Presidents Kennedy and Reagan were shot, the moment Secretary of State Henry Kissinger upped the military alert level to DEFCON III, a description of the harrowing hours after 9/11 , and never-heard details from Obama officials about the raid on Osama Bin Laden . Stephanopoulos also promises to share a first-ever account of the unfolding Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot from staff inside the Situation Room.

Wally McNamee/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty “As someone who has worked in and covered the White House, and reported on many presidents in crisis, George Stephanopoulos has a unique vantage point on the history of the Situation Room," says Ben Sevier, executive vice president and publisher at Grand Central Publishing. Sevier continues: "His fast-paced and gripping account of the room where it happens draws from his firsthand experience, interviews with insiders, eyewitness transcripts, and historical documents, providing invaluable insight on many of the decision points that have shaped the modern world.” Stephanopoulos' 1999 memoir All Too Human: A Political Education , about his time advising President Clinton, became a The New York Times Best Seller following its release. The Situation Room publishes May 14, 2024, and is available for preorder in hardcover, e-book and audiobook formats.

Sevier continues: "His fast-paced and gripping account of the room where it happens draws from his firsthand experience, interviews with insiders, eyewitness transcripts, and historical documents, providing invaluable insight on many of the decision points that have shaped the modern world.” Stephanopoulos' 1999 memoir All Too Human: A Political Education , about his time advising President Clinton, became a The New York Times Best Seller following its release. The Situation Room publishes May 14, 2024, and is available for preorder in hardcover, e-book and audiobook formats.

She was previously an Associate Editor for the Health vertical for six years, and prior to joining PEOPLE worked at Health Magazine.

White House Photographs. John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston Jacqueline started the tradition of decorating the White House Christmas tree according to a theme, choosing "Nutcracker Suite" in honor of the ballet for the family's first year in office. 05 of 28 The Johnson Years — 1963-1969 AP President Lyndon B. Johnson, 59, and Claudia "Lady Bird" Johnson, 55 — plus their dog, Yuki — admire the tree in the Yellow Oval Room in 1967. After the death of John F. Kennedy, the Johnsons opted for holiday décor that was comforting and nostalgic, but the First Lady added a touch of glitter to the tree that year with silver balls, silver stars and round mirrors. 06 of 28 The Nixon Years — 1969-1974 Nixon Presidential Library and Museum During a white Christmas at the White House in 1973, Pat Nixon, 61, and President Richard Nixon , 60, admire a stocky snowman on their lawn. 07 of 28 The Nixon Dogs Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum The First Lady instituted "Candlelight Tours" of the White House during the holidays for working-class families unable to visit during daytime hours, so they could see the grand trees like this one, in 1971. 08 of 28 The Ford Years — 1974-1977 Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Betty Ford, 56, poses with President Gerald Ford, 61, in front of the tree during their first Christmas at the White House in 1974. 09 of 28 A Homemade Christmas Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Libra The First Lady chose a patchwork theme that Christmas to emphasize frugality and simplicity during the recession, even suggesting Americans make all their ornaments to save money. 10 of 28 The Carter Years — 1977-1981 Rosalynn Carter (here at age 53 with grandchildren Sarah Carter, almost 2, and Jason Carter, 5) chose a Victorian theme for the tree in 1980, adorning it with dolls, hats, fans, tapestries and laces. The same year she threw one of the White House's largest Christmas parties, a huge event on the South Lawn featuring an entire ice-skating rink. 11 of 28 The Reagan Years — 1981-1989 Bettmann/CORBIS President Ronald Reagan, 73, and Nancy Reagan , 63, play with their new puppy Lucky, a Bouvier des Flandres, in front of the tree in 1984. 12 of 28 Nancy Reagan and Mr. T National Geographic The First Lady invited Mr. T to dress as Santa at the children's party in 1983, and then famously sat on his lap and prentended to tell him what she wanted for Christmas. 13 of 28 The George H.W. Bush Years — 1989-1993 Hulton Archive Contributor A champion of literacy, President George H.W. Bush , 67, reads to his grandchildren on Christmas Eve 1991. 14 of 28 Barbara Bush and Millie Hulton Archive Contributor First Lady Barbara Bush , 67, stands with the family's springer spaniel Millie next to the tree in 1992. The theme that year was "Gift-Givers," and White House florists created 88 gift-giving characters to decorate the branches. 15 of 28 The Clinton Years — 1993-2001 Mark Duncan/AP Photographed in the State Dining Room, President Bill Clinton , 47, and Hillary Clinton , 46, stand in front of the tree for their holiday greeting card in 1993, the same year they organized the first official menorah lighting at the White House for Hanukkah. 16 of 28 Hillary Clinton Hulton Archive Contributor First Lady Hillary Clinton holds up a pair of snowman ornaments for 1998's Christmas theme, "A Winter Wonderland." 17 of 28 The George W. Bush Years — 2001-2009 Ron Edmonds/AP In 2001, the first Christmas after the Sept. 11 attacks, Laura Bush , 55, chose "Home for the Holidays" as the White House theme. Although she began preparations in March, she said, "Home just meant so much more to everyone ... after Sept. 11." That year, the iconic gingerbread house — created by White House pastry chef Roland Mesnier — featured two angels, holding stars, on both sides of an American flag that sat on top of the replica of the presidential home. 18 of 28 Laura and George W. Bush The White House/Eric Draper/AP Laura Bush, 58, and George W. Bush , 58, pose in the Blue Room in front of the 2004 tree. The theme that year was "A Season of Merriment and Melody," and the room was filled with 350 instrument ornaments. 19 of 28 The Obama Years — 2009-2017 The White House Official White House Photographer Michelle Obama , 45, came up with the theme "Reflect, Rejoice, Renew" in 2009, the first year she and President Barack Obama , 48, spent in the White House. 20 of 28 A Recycled Bo UPI/Kevin Dietsch /LANDOV Michelle had many original ideas during her years as First Lady, including building a replica of the family dog, Bo, out of plastic garbage bags in 2011. 21 of 28 Snowmen Friends or Foes? Jon Elswick/AP In 2015, Michelle had the White House decorators set up 56 "snow people" to represent each of the United States' states and territories, and did it again in 2016. Barack, though, was apparently not a fan, jokingly telling PEOPLE that he finds them "a little creepy." "There's a whole kind of Chucky element to them," he said. Once the White House staff learned of the President's aversion, they pranked him by moving one of the snowmen to peek into the Oval Office. 22 of 28 The Trump Years — 2017-2021 Cheriss May/NurPhoto/Getty For President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump 's first year at 1600 Pennsylvania, she chose a "Time-Honored Traditions" theme to "pay respect to 200 years of holiday traditions at the White House," a press release from her office said. The decorations included an homage to the first themed White House Christmas — which was the "Nutcracker Suite" in 1961 — a Christmas dinner display featuring the china from President Ronald Reagan, and the official White House Christmas tree, adorned with glass ornaments depicting the seal of each State and territory. 23 of 28 Red Letter Day Melania Trump. FLOTUS/Twitter The First Lady faced criticism in 2018 when she chose an all-red palette for a portion of the "American Treasures" themed decorations. But she stood by her distinct choice. "We are in 21st Century and everybody has a different taste," she said at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, as seen in video obtained by Reuters. "I think they look fantastic. I hope everybody will come over and visit it. In real life, they look even more beautiful. You are all welcome to visit the White House, the people's house," she said during her appearance as part of her Be Best initiative. 24 of 28 White House, White Décor Melania Trump/Twitter For 2019 , Melania opted for a predominantly bright-and-white holiday theme. The first lady tweeted a video showing her touring the seasonal decorations, including ornate gold-and-white trees, a garden's worth of white flowers and a mini replica of the White House itself, adorned with tiny wreaths. In the clip showcasing the design, titled "The Spirit of America," Mrs. Trump walked through the decked-out halls, admiring the arrangements, which were put together by volunteers . 25 of 28 The Biden Years — 2021-Present ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images First Lady Jill Biden and a team of more than 100 volunteers decked the halls of the White House for the holidays with 41 Christmas trees and 25 wreaths, 6,000 feet of ribbon, more than 300 candles, 10,000 ornaments and 78,750 lights. The decorations aligned with 2021's theme: "Gifts from the Heart." "The things we hold sacred unite us and transcend distance, time, and even the constraints of a pandemic: faith, family, and friendship; a love of the arts, learning, and nature; gratitude, service, and community; unity and peace," the couple wrote in a commemorative visitors' guide . "These are the gifts that tie together the heart strings of our lives. These are the Gifts from the Heart ." 26 of 28 The People's House White House The 2022 decorations are themed "We the People," and feature 83,615 holiday lights, 77 Christmas trees, a gingerbread house bedecked in 40 lbs. of icing — and nods to the White House pets: the Bidens' German shepherd Commander and cat Willow . A new addition to the White House collection this year is a menorah created by the Executive Residence Carpentry Shop using wood that was removed from the building during a Truman-era renovation in the 1950s. 27 of 28 Better Together White House Each room of the White House is decorated in this year's theme, which the White House explains in a release is meant to symbolize "what brings us together during the holidays and throughout the year." The East Wing Lobby, for instance, is bedecked with holiday greenery and red cardinals — meant to signify the presence of lost loves ones — lining its columns and beams. 28 of 28 Something Sweet White House Among the other notable pieces of holiday décor is the annual gingerbread replica of the White House, made with 20 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 30 sheets of gingerbread dough, 100 lbs. of pastillage, 30 lbs. of chocolate, and 40 lbs. of royal icing.

Her work as a writer/editor has previously appeared in places like Bustle, LAMag, and HelloGiggles. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 19, 2025 01:57PM EDT Comments Bill Clinton in September 2024. Photo: John Nacion/Getty Bill Clinton returned to Oklahoma City to help commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing — which remains the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history. Clinton, who was president during the attack that killed 168 people , including 19 children, and injured over 600 others, spoke downtown at the First Church on Saturday, April 19. He honored the victims, survivors, first responders and all those affected by the tragedy. During his remarks, which were broadcasted for viewing by the Clinton Foundation, Clinton implored the country to adopt the “Oklahoma Standard” of unity. “Everybody is arguing about whose resentments matter most. Whose resentments are more valid,” he said of the current state of politics. Where Are the Survivors of the Oklahoma City Bombing Today? Here’s How Young Victims Remember the Day, 30 Years Later “If our lives are gonna be dominated by the effort to dominate people we disagree with, we’re gonna put the 250 year march toward a more perfect union at risk,” he continued, before saying that today’s America should come together in “service, honor and kindness” — just as the people of Oklahoma did after the deadly attack . Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton sit among family members of Oklahoma City bombing victims at a memorial service on April 23, 1995. Diana Walker/Contour by Getty On April 19, 1995, a truck filled with explosives was parked outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosives detonated just after 9 a.m. local time as employees were beginning their work day. The attack was planned and executed by former Army sergeant and Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. In a video posted on the Clinton Foundation website on April 11, Clinton recalled the day of the historic event. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. “The nation’s eyes were there. The nation’s heart was broken there,” he said. “I was privately praying that I would find the right words, the right tone, the right rhythm to somehow get into the mind and heart of as many Americans as possible,” he recalled. Okla. City Bombing Survivor Made a Promise to Herself Under Rubble — Now She's a CEO: 'Keep Going' Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum , told PEOPLE in 2020 that “We were defined not by the tragedy, but by the tenderness of the response . Instead of running away from the building in fear, people rushed toward it to help."

Clinton, who was president during the attack that killed 168 people , including 19 children, and injured over 600 others, spoke downtown at the First Church on Saturday, April 19. He honored the victims, survivors, first responders and all those affected by the tragedy. During his remarks, which were broadcasted for viewing by the Clinton Foundation, Clinton implored the country to adopt the “Oklahoma Standard” of unity. “Everybody is arguing about whose resentments matter most. Whose resentments are more valid,” he said of the current state of politics. Where Are the Survivors of the Oklahoma City Bombing Today? Here’s How Young Victims Remember the Day, 30 Years Later “If our lives are gonna be dominated by the effort to dominate people we disagree with, we’re gonna put the 250 year march toward a more perfect union at risk,” he continued, before saying that today’s America should come together in “service, honor and kindness” — just as the people of Oklahoma did after the deadly attack .

Diana Walker/Contour by Getty Diana Walker/Contour by Getty On April 19, 1995, a truck filled with explosives was parked outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosives detonated just after 9 a.m. local time as employees were beginning their work day. The attack was planned and executed by former Army sergeant and Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. In a video posted on the Clinton Foundation website on April 11, Clinton recalled the day of the historic event.

A Look at the Activist's Life 27 Years After Bill Clinton Scandal Monica Lewinsky first made headlines in 1998 after reports that she had an affair with President Bill Clinton By Alex Gurley Alex Gurley Alex Gurley is a contributing writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously appeared in Just Jared and Buzzfeed. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on February 19, 2025 12:40PM EST Photo: Getty ; Amy Sussman/Getty It’s been over 25 years since Monica Lewinsky was thrust into the national spotlight after her affair with then-President Bill Clinton . Lewinsky was fresh out of college when she met Clinton in 1995 during his first term as president of the United States. Over the next two years, the pair became intimately involved — exchanging gifts, making late-night phone calls and engaging in a sexual relationship. “At the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss. And at the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences,” Lewinsky shared in a 2015 TED Talk that has since been viewed more than 21 million times. In 1998, Lewinsky and Clinton’s affair was made public following a series of legal investigations, several recorded conversations and one conservative news report. Overnight, Lewinsky’s life was turned upside down, and she was suddenly the subject of intense media and online scrutiny. A Guide to Bill Clinton's 1990s Controversies “Not a day goes by that I am not reminded of my mistake, and I regret that mistake deeply,” she said in her TED Talk. “In 1998, after having been swept up in an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before.” Amid the subsequent legal proceedings, Lewinsky was hounded by the public and the paparazzi. In July 1998, she agreed to testify before a grand jury and handed over a dark blue dress that she said she had worn while she was intimate with Clinton. In exchange, she was granted immunity — and then attempted to assimilate back into her daily life. After initially trying to embrace life as a public figure, Lewinsky ultimately stepped out of the public eye and remained silent for almost a decade. But in recent years, Lewinsky has returned to the spotlight — this time in the hopes of helping others who have been shamed and cyberbullied. She has successfully rebranded herself as a writer and activist, speaking out against online harassment . In 2021, she started her own production company, aiming to give a platform to others who have been silenced, and in 2025, she announced she was starting her own podcast, Reclaiming, during an appearance on Today . Read ahead to learn more about Monica Lewinsky’s life following the scandal, and where she is today. What happened between Lewinsky and Clinton? Hulton Archive/Getty In 1995, Lewinsky began working as an unpaid summer intern at the White House. According to the Washington Post , she was just 21 years old when she met Clinton, who was then serving his first term as president and was 27 years her senior. The pair reportedly first crossed paths while Lewinsky was working in the office of White House chief of staff Leon Panetta , who worked closely with and was appointed by Clinton. By November of that year, Lewinsky had accepted a paying job in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, and around the same time, she began a sexual relationship with Clinton. According to independent counsel Ken Starr , who had been investigating Clinton at the time, the pair had 10 sexual encounters over the next two years, during which they communicated often and presented each other with small gifts. “At the time — at least from my point of view — it was an authentic connection, with emotional intimacy, frequent visits, plans made, phone calls and gifts exchanged. In my early 20s, I was too young to understand the real-life consequences and too young to see that I would be sacrificed for political expediency. I look back now, shake my head in disbelief, and wonder: what was I — what were we — thinking?” Lewinsky later wrote in Vanity Fair . In April 1996, Lewinsky was transferred from her job in the White House to a public affairs position at the Pentagon as some of her superiors began to grow concerned she was spending too much time with Clinton. Despite the transfer, the pair continued to have sexual encounters until Clinton ended the affair in May 1997, after which they remained in contact. How was Lewinsky and Clinton’s affair made public? Hulton Archive/Getty Following the conclusion of Lewinsky and Clinton’s affair, Lewinsky confided in her Pentagon co-worker Linda Tripp . During conversations between the two women, Lewinsky detailed the affair she had had with President Clinton. Unbeknownst to Lewinsky, Tripp had begun recording their private conversations in late 1997. Tripp later shared these recordings with a literary agent and a reporter from Newsweek — although the outlet did not move forward with the story at that time. Meanwhile, Clinton was under investigation for several different allegations, including claims from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones , who said that the president had sexually harassed her while he was governor of Arkansas. In October 1997, the team behind the case were anonymously tipped off about a possible Lewinsky-Clinton affair. Then, in December 1997, Lewinsky was subpoenaed by lawyers for Jones’ suit against Clinton. During Lewinsky’s final visit to the White House that month, Clinton allegedly encouraged her to be “evasive” with investigators, according to CNN . Her lawyer later said that she could deny the affair in an affidavit to avoid being deposed in Jones’ case. In January 1998, Lewinsky officially signed the affidavit , claiming not to have had a sexual relationship with Clinton. Shortly after, Tripp brought her recordings to Starr, who had been investigating Clinton’s involvement in an allegedly fraudulent real estate deal. The Justice Department permitted Starr to investigate Lewinsky under the possibility of perjury, witness tampering and obstruction of justice in the Jones case — and soon after, the FBI questioned Lewinsky. One day later, on Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton denied the affair during a sworn deposition as part of the Jones lawsuit — which would later play a role in his impeachment trial. That same day, the Drudge Report, a conservative news aggregator, broke the news of Clinton and Lewinsky’s affair, reporting that Newsweek opted not to publish their article exposing the scandal. Founder Matt Drudge has never explained how he found out about the affair. In the days that followed, Clinton publicly denied his relationship with Lewinsky, delivering his now-infamous line, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky." How did the public react to the news of their affair? Diana Walker/Getty News of Lewinsky and Clinton’s romantic relationship dominated the media. Lewinsky spent weeks hiding from paparazzi and the public at her mother’s apartment; her lawyer only allowed her to leave for doctor’s appointments and the occasional supervised outing. Over the next few months, everything Lewinsky did was publicized. She was frequently targeted by cyberbullies and was subject to cruel jokes on late-night talk shows . “The public humiliation was excruciating. Life was almost unbearable,” she later said. “In 1998, when news of my affair with Bill Clinton broke, I was arguably the most humiliated person in the world. Thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the internet,” Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair . Looking back on the experience during her TED Talk , Lewinsky said she was “swept up” into a news cycle that had never been seen before. She recalled being “branded as a tramp, tart, slut, whore” and “bimbo.” She noted that people who spoke about her seemed to forget she was a human with feelings too. “I was known by many, but actually known by few. I get it. It was easy to forget ‘that woman’ was dimensional and had a soul,” she said. The intense public criticism eventually led Lewinsky down a dark path of serious suicidal temptations. In Vanity Fair , Lewinsky recalled a time when her mother would not let her out of her sight, sitting by her bed at night, worried that she might take her own life. “The shame, the scorn, and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that I would take my own life — a fear that I would be literally humiliated to death,” she wrote, adding, “I have never actually attempted suicide, but I had strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigations and during one or two periods after.” What did Lewinsky do after the scandal? Vinnie Zuffante/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty After agreeing to an in-depth interview with prosecutors and in front of a grand jury, Starr granted Lewinsky immunity. Although the legal protection limited what she could speak about publicly, she tried to embrace her new life as a public figure. She told her side of the story to biographer Andrew Morton for the book Monica's Story and gave a televised interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20 that, according to CNN , was watched live by 70 million people. In 1999, she launched a handbag line called The Real Monica Inc., inspired by her love of sewing and knitting. She began making bags at the height of the Clinton scandal when she had extra time on her hands and decided to sell them after getting a positive response from friends. “Quite frankly, the name is what attracts people to the product, but what's going to satisfy the customer is that it's a great product,” she told The New York Times in 2000. “I don't want people to think I'm taking advantage of this.” She later signed on to host the reality dating show Mr. Personality and appeared as herself on Saturday Night Live. Lewinsky also took on a gig as a spokesperson for the dieting company Jenny Craig . But Lewinsky’s decision to face the public didn’t come without controversy. Some claimed she was trying to capitalize on her notoriety — on CNN in 2000, she told Larry King she was still trying to pay off her enormous legal bills. “Apparently, others talking about me is okay; me speaking out for myself is not. I turned down offers that would have earned me more than $10 million, because they didn’t feel like the right thing to do. Over time, the media circus quieted down, but it never quite moved on, even as I attempted to move on,” she later wrote in Vanity Fair . What happened when Lewinsky left the spotlight for a decade? Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic Lewinsky eventually stepped away from the spotlight. In 2005, she moved to England and enrolled at the London School of Economics. “I moved to England to study, to challenge myself, to escape scrutiny and to reimagine my identity. My professors and fellow students at the London School of Economics were wonderful — welcoming and respectful. I had more anonymity in London, perhaps due to the fact that I spent most of my waking hours in class or buried in the library,” Lewinsky recalled. In 2006, she graduated with a master’s degree in social psychology, hoping it would be a “gateway to a more normal life.” Over the next few years, she moved around the U.S., living in Los Angeles, New York and Portland, Oregon. She applied to jobs relating to “creative communication” and “branding,” with an emphasis on charity campaigns, to no avail. Companies often worried about her history or wanted her to be a public spokesperson for the organization. She eventually realized that “traditional employment” would not be an option for her. “​​I’ve managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects, usually with startups that I have participated in, or with loans from friends and family,” she said in 2014. Despite financially struggling, Lewinsky stayed away from the spotlight, continually denying press requests and putting off opportunities — partially in fear of interfering with Hillary Clinton ’s 2008 presidential campaign. Why did Lewinsky embrace being a public figure again? Jesse Grant/Getty In 2014, Lewinsky ultimately made a return to the public eye. After almost a decade of laying low, she wanted to use her platform for good and to help others who had also experienced bullying. She wrote in Vanity Fair that her opinion about remaining reclusive first shifted after speaking with her mother about the death of college freshman Tyler Clementi , who died by suicide in 2010 after he was secretly live-streamed kissing another man. Although she admitted her story was not equivalent to that of Tyler’s, she wished she could have told him that it was possible to get through such a trying time. “In the wake of Tyler’s tragedy, my own suffering took on a different meaning,” she wrote. “Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?” What does Lewinsky do for a living now? Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty In 2014, Lewinsky made her return to the public eye with an essay titled “Shame and Survival” in Vanity Fair — her debut as a contributing editor for the magazine. For the first time in more than a decade, she opened up about her past and expressed regret for all that had transpired. “I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened,” she wrote. Following Lewinsky’s return to the spotlight, she dedicated a large portion of her time to advocating against online bullying. She has spoken publicly about being an advocate for others and creating a safer social media environment. She also became a strategic advisor for the anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution, which was founded by MacKenzie Bezos . In 2019, Lewinsky signed on as a producer on Impeachment: American Crime Story , Ryan Murphy ’s series chronicling her affair with Clinton and his impeachment trial. While she had previously turned down many offers to tell her story, she told Variety that the idea of working with Murphy was “very exciting.” Lewinsky became the main consultant for the show, and star Beanie Feldstein said that Lewinsky approved “every word” of the script . “Obviously I have personal and selfish reasons, all sorts of reasons, for having participated in Impeachment , but the larger goal is how to move the conversation forward , a sort of collective shift — whether it's a sex scandal or not, and the kind of blame that was put on a young person and the kind of erasing and turning a blind eye to where responsibility really sat," she told PEOPLE. In 2021, Lewinsky founded her own production company, Alt Ending Productions, and signed a first-look deal for scripted dramas with 20th Television. Lewinsky explained that with the company, she hopes to share the “voices or perspectives” of people that audiences “historically don’t hear from or see.” “I’m interested in storytelling that is entertaining, thought-provoking and emotion-stirring — that moves a conversation forward by exploring the human condition from an unexpected lens,” she shared in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. Most recently, she was an executive producer on the Max documentary 15 Minutes of Shame , an investigation into public shaming and cyber-harassment that put a spotlight on those who have experienced it firsthand. In February 2024, Lewinsky became the face of Reformation's "You've Got the Power" campaign at 50, hoping to build voter registration awareness. Lewinsky posed for photos in the brand's new workwear collection, which will launch with a new voting hub online. "Voting is using our voice to be heard and it’s the most defining — and powerful — aspect of democracy," Lewinsky said in press release. " Voting is always important , but the stakes are especially high this year with voter frustration and apathy threatening to meaningfully impact turnout." In February 2025, Lewinsky announced during an appearance on Today that she's launching her own podcast called Reclaiming , which features her talking about her own journey and speaking with celebrity guests and friends about theirs. "I definitely think what I went through ... it lets people know I'm not going to judge them," she said.

She began making bags at the height of the Clinton scandal when she had extra time on her hands and decided to sell them after getting a positive response from friends. “Quite frankly, the name is what attracts people to the product, but what's going to satisfy the customer is that it's a great product,” she told The New York Times in 2000. “I don't want people to think I'm taking advantage of this.” She later signed on to host the reality dating show Mr. Personality and appeared as herself on Saturday Night Live. Lewinsky also took on a gig as a spokesperson for the dieting company Jenny Craig . But Lewinsky’s decision to face the public didn’t come without controversy. Some claimed she was trying to capitalize on her notoriety — on CNN in 2000, she told Larry King she was still trying to pay off her enormous legal bills. “Apparently, others talking about me is okay; me speaking out for myself is not. I turned down offers that would have earned me more than $10 million, because they didn’t feel like the right thing to do. Over time, the media circus quieted down, but it never quite moved on, even as I attempted to move on,” she later wrote in Vanity Fair .  What happened when Lewinsky left the spotlight for a decade? What happened when Lewinsky left the spotlight for a decade? Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic Lewinsky eventually stepped away from the spotlight. In 2005, she moved to England and enrolled at the London School of Economics. “I moved to England to study, to challenge myself, to escape scrutiny and to reimagine my identity. My professors and fellow students at the London School of Economics were wonderful — welcoming and respectful. I had more anonymity in London, perhaps due to the fact that I spent most of my waking hours in class or buried in the library,” Lewinsky recalled. In 2006, she graduated with a master’s degree in social psychology, hoping it would be a “gateway to a more normal life.” Over the next few years, she moved around the U.S., living in Los Angeles, New York and Portland, Oregon. She applied to jobs relating to “creative communication” and “branding,” with an emphasis on charity campaigns, to no avail. Companies often worried about her history or wanted her to be a public spokesperson for the organization. She eventually realized that “traditional employment” would not be an option for her. “​​I’ve managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects, usually with startups that I have participated in, or with loans from friends and family,” she said in 2014. Despite financially struggling, Lewinsky stayed away from the spotlight, continually denying press requests and putting off opportunities — partially in fear of interfering with Hillary Clinton ’s 2008 presidential campaign.  Why did Lewinsky embrace being a public figure again? Why did Lewinsky embrace being a public figure again? Jesse Grant/Getty Jesse Grant/Getty In 2014, Lewinsky ultimately made a return to the public eye. After almost a decade of laying low, she wanted to use her platform for good and to help others who had also experienced bullying. She wrote in Vanity Fair that her opinion about remaining reclusive first shifted after speaking with her mother about the death of college freshman Tyler Clementi , who died by suicide in 2010 after he was secretly live-streamed kissing another man. Although she admitted her story was not equivalent to that of Tyler’s, she wished she could have told him that it was possible to get through such a trying time. “In the wake of Tyler’s tragedy, my own suffering took on a different meaning,” she wrote. “Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?”  What does Lewinsky do for a living now? What does Lewinsky do for a living now? Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty In 2014, Lewinsky made her return to the public eye with an essay titled “Shame and Survival” in Vanity Fair — her debut as a contributing editor for the magazine. For the first time in more than a decade, she opened up about her past and expressed regret for all that had transpired. “I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened,” she wrote. Following Lewinsky’s return to the spotlight, she dedicated a large portion of her time to advocating against online bullying. She has spoken publicly about being an advocate for others and creating a safer social media environment. She also became a strategic advisor for the anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution, which was founded by MacKenzie Bezos . In 2019, Lewinsky signed on as a producer on Impeachment: American Crime Story , Ryan Murphy ’s series chronicling her affair with Clinton and his impeachment trial. While she had previously turned down many offers to tell her story, she told Variety that the idea of working with Murphy was “very exciting.” Lewinsky became the main consultant for the show, and star Beanie Feldstein said that Lewinsky approved “every word” of the script . “Obviously I have personal and selfish reasons, all sorts of reasons, for having participated in Impeachment , but the larger goal is how to move the conversation forward , a sort of collective shift — whether it's a sex scandal or not, and the kind of blame that was put on a young person and the kind of erasing and turning a blind eye to where responsibility really sat," she told PEOPLE. In 2021, Lewinsky founded her own production company, Alt Ending Productions, and signed a first-look deal for scripted dramas with 20th Television. Lewinsky explained that with the company, she hopes to share the “voices or perspectives” of people that audiences “historically don’t hear from or see.” “I’m interested in storytelling that is entertaining, thought-provoking and emotion-stirring — that moves a conversation forward by exploring the human condition from an unexpected lens,” she shared in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. Most recently, she was an executive producer on the Max documentary 15 Minutes of Shame , an investigation into public shaming and cyber-harassment that put a spotlight on those who have experienced it firsthand. In February 2024, Lewinsky became the face of Reformation's "You've Got the Power" campaign at 50, hoping to build voter registration awareness. Lewinsky posed for photos in the brand's new workwear collection, which will launch with a new voting hub online. "Voting is using our voice to be heard and it’s the most defining — and powerful — aspect of democracy," Lewinsky said in press release. " Voting is always important , but the stakes are especially high this year with voter frustration and apathy threatening to meaningfully impact turnout." In February 2025, Lewinsky announced during an appearance on Today that she's launching her own podcast called Reclaiming , which features her talking about her own journey and speaking with celebrity guests and friends about theirs. "I definitely think what I went through ... it lets people know I'm not going to judge them," she said.

She left PEOPLE in 2023. People Editorial Guidelines Published on December 16, 2021 09:04AM EST With two terms in the White House, a presidential library , global foundation , one memoir , two bestselling thrillers and a podcast already among his credits, former President Bill Clinton is now adding teacher to his resume. Clinton, 75, previewed President Bill Clinton Teaches Inclusive Leadership — launching today on MasterClass (with an exclusive excerpt for people.com readers below) — in an interview with PEOPLE, saying he was a MasterClass student himself. "I was always intrigued by how well they were done and the insight I got from listening to other instructors. I thought, well, I have the time, I think I'll do it." The online course takes subscribers behind the scenes of pivotal moments of his life and presidency — with unvarnished and sometimes hilarious candor—to extract lessons on mediating conflict, developing persuasive speeches and working with opponents despite deep disagreements. "I felt like it might be the last chance I would get to tell people why I believe that inclusive tribalism is better than divisive tribalism," Clinton tells PEOPLE. "We know it works better to get diverse people together, listen to all of them, and then try to do something that will be empowering to people, that will make life better, that'll make the future better. But we are living in a time when, in the political world, division and subtraction seem to work better. It's not in fashion today, but we have to keep reaching out." Hillary Clinton Reads Her Deeply Personal Planned 2016 Victory Speech: 'I've Never Shared This With Anybody' In one class, Clinton describes in detail the strategy behind his 2009 trip to North Korea to negotiate, as a private citizen,the release of two American journalists imprisoned by then-leader Kim Jong Il 's dictatorial regime. Bill Clinton. Courtesy MasterClass "The real trick was for me to get the young women out of there without giving [the North Koreans] something substantive," Clinton explains, going on to share his private conversation with Kim over dinner, and how Clinton and his team practiced in the mirror being expressionless for photos with Kim. Then there was the now-deceased dictator's attempt to trick Clinton into appearing in a propaganda film. "I almost choked," Clinton recalls. "He said, 'We have 40,000 North Koreans in native dress in a stadium nearby and they want to welcome you properly and dance for you. It would be all over television, all across Asia and the United States. … There were 40,000 people out there waiting for me. [Kim] knew I would be appalled at dissing them, but I couldn't do it." Bill Clinton Remembers Bob Dole Fondly, Rues That Reaching Across Political Lines is 'Not In Fashion Today' Clinton's leadership lessons, packaged into 14 online classes along with a downloadable "deeper dive" into his practical tips for decision-making and negotiation, are part of MasterClass's "The White House" series , which includes the recently launched Hillary Rodham Clinton Teaches the Power of Resilience and upcoming courses by former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush , and former secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright . Asked about Donald Trump 's exclusion from the un-official Ex-Presidents Club , where former presidents of both parties work together on special projects (Clinton and Bush have teamed up on disaster assistance and the Presidential Leadership Scholars program), Clinton said: "It saddens me that, basically, [Trump's] main messaging is contrary to working together. It's about him and what he wants and nothing else. And it's about momentary political benefits … based on his divisive argument about how the world works. So, yeah, I'm sorry about that."

Clinton sat for the interview via Zoom in the guest house of his home in Chappaqua, N.Y. , one month after the final episode of Impeachment: An American Crime Story aired on FX. Monica Lewinsky was one of the producers of the miniseries, which Clinton did not watch. PEOPLE asked if Clinton wanted to offer a rebuttal to Gen Z watchers who were maybe getting their first introduction to his 1993-2001 presidency from the TV dramatization of his affair with Lewinsky when she was a White House intern and his subsequent impeachment . "Well," Clinton replied, "first I would want them to know that was a tiny part of my presidency and that I regretted what I'd done wrong, and I apologize to everybody involved, and the American people agreed that I should go on by an overwhelming majority." He went on to list the accomplishments of his two terms in office, starting with "creating the first period in 50 years where there was broadly shared prosperity … where we had 18-percent income growth growing the economy … led by African-American families at 32 percent and Latino families at 24 percent." Then there was ending the war in Bosnia, prevailing in Kosovo, progress in Middle East peace — and "we found a way to cooperate with Russia." Clinton said. "It was a time of growing peace, growing cooperation in the world and that works better. That's what I would want them to know. And if they found out that, like every other human being who took a breath of air, I wasn't perfect, that's fine with me."

Clinton, 75, previewed President Bill Clinton Teaches Inclusive Leadership — launching today on MasterClass (with an exclusive excerpt for people.com readers below) — in an interview with PEOPLE, saying he was a MasterClass student himself. "I was always intrigued by how well they were done and the insight I got from listening to other instructors. I thought, well, I have the time, I think I'll do it." The online course takes subscribers behind the scenes of pivotal moments of his life and presidency — with unvarnished and sometimes hilarious candor—to extract lessons on mediating conflict, developing persuasive speeches and working with opponents despite deep disagreements. "I felt like it might be the last chance I would get to tell people why I believe that inclusive tribalism is better than divisive tribalism," Clinton tells PEOPLE. "We know it works better to get diverse people together, listen to all of them, and then try to do something that will be empowering to people, that will make life better, that'll make the future better. But we are living in a time when, in the political world, division and subtraction seem to work better. It's not in fashion today, but we have to keep reaching out." Hillary Clinton Reads Her Deeply Personal Planned 2016 Victory Speech: 'I've Never Shared This With Anybody' In one class, Clinton describes in detail the strategy behind his 2009 trip to North Korea to negotiate, as a private citizen,the release of two American journalists imprisoned by then-leader Kim Jong Il 's dictatorial regime. Bill Clinton. Courtesy MasterClass "The real trick was for me to get the young women out of there without giving [the North Koreans] something substantive," Clinton explains, going on to share his private conversation with Kim over dinner, and how Clinton and his team practiced in the mirror being expressionless for photos with Kim. Then there was the now-deceased dictator's attempt to trick Clinton into appearing in a propaganda film. "I almost choked," Clinton recalls. "He said, 'We have 40,000 North Koreans in native dress in a stadium nearby and they want to welcome you properly and dance for you. It would be all over television, all across Asia and the United States. … There were 40,000 people out there waiting for me. [Kim] knew I would be appalled at dissing them, but I couldn't do it." Bill Clinton Remembers Bob Dole Fondly, Rues That Reaching Across Political Lines is 'Not In Fashion Today' Clinton's leadership lessons, packaged into 14 online classes along with a downloadable "deeper dive" into his practical tips for decision-making and negotiation, are part of MasterClass's "The White House" series , which includes the recently launched Hillary Rodham Clinton Teaches the Power of Resilience and upcoming courses by former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush , and former secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright . Asked about Donald Trump 's exclusion from the un-official Ex-Presidents Club , where former presidents of both parties work together on special projects (Clinton and Bush have teamed up on disaster assistance and the Presidential Leadership Scholars program), Clinton said: "It saddens me that, basically, [Trump's] main messaging is contrary to working together. It's about him and what he wants and nothing else. And it's about momentary political benefits … based on his divisive argument about how the world works. So, yeah, I'm sorry about that."

Clinton sat for the interview via Zoom in the guest house of his home in Chappaqua, N.Y. , one month after the final episode of Impeachment: An American Crime Story aired on FX. Monica Lewinsky was one of the producers of the miniseries, which Clinton did not watch. PEOPLE asked if Clinton wanted to offer a rebuttal to Gen Z watchers who were maybe getting their first introduction to his 1993-2001 presidency from the TV dramatization of his affair with Lewinsky when she was a White House intern and his subsequent impeachment . "Well," Clinton replied, "first I would want them to know that was a tiny part of my presidency and that I regretted what I'd done wrong, and I apologize to everybody involved, and the American people agreed that I should go on by an overwhelming majority." He went on to list the accomplishments of his two terms in office, starting with "creating the first period in 50 years where there was broadly shared prosperity … where we had 18-percent income growth growing the economy … led by African-American families at 32 percent and Latino families at 24 percent." Then there was ending the war in Bosnia, prevailing in Kosovo, progress in Middle East peace — and "we found a way to cooperate with Russia." Clinton said. "It was a time of growing peace, growing cooperation in the world and that works better. That's what I would want them to know. And if they found out that, like every other human being who took a breath of air, I wasn't perfect, that's fine with me." Where Is Monica Lewinsky Now?

Royals British Royal Family British Royal Family News Prince Harry's Emotional Plea: 'My Lock Screen Is a Picture of My Kids—What's Yours?' as He Highlights Social Media Dangers The Duke of Sussex received a standing ovation after his remarks at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York City By Rachel Burchfield Rachel Burchfield Rachel Burchfield is a former digital editor who covered the royal family at PEOPLE. She left PEOPLE in 2025. People Editorial Guidelines and Elizabeth Rosner Elizabeth Rosner Elizabeth Rosner joined PEOPLE as a Senior Reporter in 2024.

People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 24, 2024 11:24AM EDT Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attends the Clinton Global Initiative 2024 Annual Meeting at New York Hilton Midtown on Sept. 24, 2024 in New York City. Photo: John Nacion/Getty Prince Harry ’s visit to New York City continues with a powerful speaking engagement for the Clinton Foundation about the dangers of children consuming online content. On Tuesday, Sept. 24, Harry delivered remarks solo on stage and, as he did so, spoke in front of a screen filled with images of phone lock screens. The photos on the lock screens were children whose lives were lost to social media, which stayed in the background as Harry revealed that "My lock screen is a picture of my kids. What's yours?" he told the crowd, referring to Prince Archie , 5, and Princess Lilibet , 3, who he shares with wife Meghan Markle . In his remarks, Harry spoke about the importance of no more children being lost to social media and how it has become a crisis that cannot be ignored. He mentioned the work of his and Meghan's new initiative, The Parents Network , created to help families with children impacted by traumas related to social media. The couple spoke about the new venture on CBS Sunday Morning on Aug. 4, telling Jane Pauley they wanted to protect their children from harmful online content.

Craig Barritt/Getty On stage at CGI on Sept. 24, Harry said it was because of children lost to social media and the parents left behind to grieve as to why "we at the Archewell Foundation are committed to this issue," he said. Prince Harry said that he, like many, didn't grow up with a phone, and that "Young people today possess an incredible understanding of technology that older generations may struggle to grasp." He added, "Our laws and regulations are different, state to state, country to country. We may have different backgrounds, viewpoints, beliefs and even access to the internet itself, but the one thing that we can universally agree on is the safety of our children." Harry went on to speak about how online platforms, specifically social media, are designed to create addictions, and told the crowd, "Kids may get into trouble. I know a thing or two about that," he said to laughter. "We have the fate of the future — their future — in our hands," he said before the crowd gave him a standing ovation as his remarks concluded.

Craig Barritt/Getty During the couple's CBS Sunday Morning appearance, Meghan shared more about their concern for online safety: "Our kids are young — they're 3 and 5. They're amazing. But all you want to do as parents is protect them. So as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there, and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good." Harry added, "At this point, we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder. And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this." Meghan encouraged everyone to "look at it through the lens of 'What if it was my daughter? What if it was my son?' " She added, "If you look at it through the lens as a parent, there's no way to see that any other way than to try to find a solution." Prince Harry joined a lineup that included actor Matt Damon and Chef José Andrés for the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting, with Harry speaking on day two of the event. This year’s annual meeting of the nonpartisan organization founded by former U.S. President Bill Clinton focused on “What’s Working” to address “climate resilience, global health equity, gun violence, the protection of journalists, humanitarian crises and other pressing global challenges,” PEOPLE previously reported .

Clinton wrote on X , reposting a report from the Associated Press , which said that Prince Harry, Damon and Andrés were “set to speak” there. The former president, 78, told the AP that the 2024 CGI would “double down” on efforts. “We started CGI because we wanted to have a meeting where people didn’t just talk about big problems, but where we could roll up our sleeves and get something done,” Clinton said in a statement to the outlet. “It’s more important than ever to be optimistic and realize we all have the ability to make a difference.” Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attends the Clinton Global Initiative 2024 Annual Meeting at New York Hilton Midtown on Sept. 24, 2024 in New York City.

Bob Dole, Former Republican Senator and Past Presidential Candidate, Dies at 98 "Bob had recently been diagnosed with lung cancer, and I was were there to offer the same support , love, and encouragement that they showed me and Jill when our son Beau battled cancer, and that the Doles have shown us over the half century we've been friends," he wrote. Noting that the two "picked up right where we left off," Biden continued that though they "often disagreed" on certain topics, Dole "never hesitated to work with me or other Democrats when it mattered most." "Bob was an American statesman like few in our history. A war hero and among the greatest of the Greatest Generation. And to me, he was also a friend whom I could look to for trusted guidance, or a humorous line at just the right moment to settle frayed nerves. I will miss my friend," he added. "But I am grateful for the times we shared, and for the friendship Jill and I and our family have built with Liddy and the entire Dole family."

Oh my God. Hi Bill!," the employee said excitedly after realizing her mistake By Lizzie Hyman Lizzie Hyman Lizzie Hyman is a Writer-Reporter for PEOPLE, where she contributes in-depth features and covers entertainment and news across both print and digital platforms. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on October 15, 2024 11:04AM EDT Comments An employee was in for quite a surprise when a president dropped by a McDonald’s in Georgia over the weekend — but he wasn't the exactly the man she thought he was. While stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, Oct. 13, former President Bill Clinton stopped by the fast food chain and came face-to-face with a shocked employee. “You Joe? Mr. Joe," the employee asked Clinton, 78, who was sporting a jacket with “USA” fastened on the back. It only took the employee a few seconds to realize it was not President Joe Biden , but rather the 42nd U.S. president. Correcting her mistake the employee said, “Bill? Oh my God. Hi Bill!" She then ran around the counter to give the former president a big hug. Keeping their arms around each other, the woman asked a fellow employee to take a photo and said, “This is Bill, y’all.” Angel Ureña , Deputy Chief of Staff for Clinton, recorded the wholesome encounter and shared it on X (formerly Twitter) . “The boss was stumping for @KamalaHarris in Georgia and had to stop by the old stomping grounds, @McDonalds,” he captioned the clip. From Left: Joe Biden; and Bill Clinton. Kevin Dietsch/Getty; Andrew Chin/Getty This is not the first time Clinton, who was notorious for his visits to McDonald's, has expressed his love for the fast food chain. Most recently, while speaking on behalf of Harris, 59, at the Democratic National Convention in August, Clinton highlighted the vice president's first job as a fast food worker. “I’ll be so happy when she enters the White House as president because she will break my record as the president who spent the most time at McDonald’s,” he joked. Bill Clinton, 78, Takes Shot at Donald Trump's Age During DNC Speech: 'I'm Still Younger' Bill Clinton on Aug. 21, 2024. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty On Sunday, Clinton also spoke to congregants at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Ga, in support of Harris. "This whole election and the future of the country is turning out to be what people who were sort of on the fence about voting are going to do in the next three and a half weeks," Clinton said. He added, "It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen." Following Sunday's events, it was announced by the Harris campaign that Clinton is set to headline a bus tour through eastern North Carolina during the remainder of this week.

In This Article View All In This Article Our Editorial Policy Inside the PEOPLE Newsroom Our Values We're a Force for Good Diversity & Inclusion Fact-Checking, Accuracy & Corrections The PEOPLE Health Squad Sources Editorial Independence and Impartiality Shopping Recommendations PEOPLE's Editorial Policy Our Editorial Policy If you read it on PEOPLE, you know it is true. In a world of rumors run wild, there are all kinds of stories that take the internet by storm and provoke strong reactions — even from major public figures — before anybody even knows if the information is true. As one of the world's most-read digital publications, we take seriously our responsibility to fight against viral misinformation by having steadfast journalistic standards that guide us in telling true, accurate, and authoritative stories — always. Every piece of content on PEOPLE is conceived of, created, and communicated to you with these core principles front of mind. PEOPLE tells you what's true : There are plenty of blind items and clickbait headlines out there. But PEOPLE takes its approach to celebrity news and information extremely seriously. The most A-list stars come to us to share their news and personal stories and we are in constant dialogue with all the big players in Hollywood and throughout the entertainment industry who speak to us because they know we value the truth. Reliable information is power: That meme going viral on Instagram? We won't write about it or share it until we can authenticate the who, what, when, where and why. We don't jump on bandwagons till we are confident we know what we're talking about and can deliver an authoritative, accurate and informative account. We're here to serve YOU : Every PEOPLE article is published with the intention of helping you feel more informed about the news—whatever news means to you on any given day: (Hey, sometimes you really do need to know what the newest flavor of Oreos is going to be, and there's no shame in that!) So whether you want to read about Kim Kardashian 's relationship, the war in Ukraine or shop for our editors' picks for best new sneakers, we've got you covered. We're transparent. If we ever need to update a story with new information, we'll let you know that we did so through precise time stamps. If we need to make a substantive change to a story if something new comes to light, we'll be honest about why that happened and explain ourselves in a clearly-labeled and dated note. Courtesy DDM Inside the PEOPLE Newsroom Bringing you the latest news is a big, never-ending production. Our reporters are among the most connected people in the world: on the red carpet, at the White House, in the worlds of tech, sports, style and beauty, food and more. But we also shine at finding those small, never-before-heard stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things—in any zip code in this country and beyond. Our news team members have their fingers on the pulse and keep you plugged in to what's happening, minute by minute, no matter the hour of day, and continuously as the story unfolds. And our expert editors are there to give you the best recommendations: what to watch, read, listen to, wear, cook and buy. Our Values At PEOPLE, we hold some principles sacred. We will not publish a photograph of a celebrity's child taken against their parents' wishes, barring a serious news value. We believe in a person's right to privacy, so we will not expose a pregnancy or someone's health issues against their wishes, nor will we share identifying details that might betray the location of the home where a public figure resides. We always strive to have an open dialogue with the people we cover and give them an opportunity to tell their stories. We're a Force for Good You may notice PEOPLE covers some pretty heavy topics, from themes of drug abuse and sexual assault to child abuse or suicide. At every turn, we're committed to helping you gain insight from these incredibly personal stories or be inspired to help: we will help you find a story subject's GoFundMe, if you're moved to make a donation, or we'll give you helpful resources if you or someone in your life is in a similar situation. We have stringent guidelines for writing about suicide, and work in partnership with #CrisisTextLine to encourage people to make the call for help if they're struggling with their mental health. And we vet and will share links to legitimate 501c3 charities when we cover major developing news about everything from environmental crises to the war in Ukraine. Diversity & Inclusion At its core, PEOPLE is a brand devoted to highlighting diverse stories: The triumphs, tragedies and extraordinary moments in the lives of all people. We have always been committed to representing as many voices as possible and work constantly to seek out and showcase new ones. We seek always to improve the diversity and scope of the talent we profile, stories we cover, people we feature, and platforms we amplify. It is a top priority for PEOPLE to be transparent about the steps we're taking to ensure our content is representative, fair, educational, and inclusive. At PEOPLE, we strive to be a safe, inclusive, and judgment-free place to consume content. We apply rigorous standards to the language we use around sexual orientation, gender orientation, race, mental and physical health, including body issues and how people become families. PEOPLE is also guided by the Dotdash Meredith Anti-Bias Review Board , which advises on our content to ensure that it is free of bias and as inclusive as possible. Fact-Checking, Accuracy & Corrections Accurate information is at the core of every story we publish at PEOPLE. Our writers and editors investigate rumors and claims and verify all information gathered for all we publish. We consult credible, in-the-know sources to ensure we're providing proper context and background. Our work is rigorously evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and timeliness during the editing process. But if you ever find fault with a story we've published, or have a substantive update or possible correction to share, we want to hear from you. Please email corrections@people.com. We are committed to telling you if a factual error has been made on a news story at the time of publication. We will correct the error as quickly as possible and append a clearly-labeled note to inform you of the corrected information. When an article is factually correct, but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's note. Our editorial teams do their best to update our large library of "evergreen" stories to ensure they continue to be timely, accurate, and relevant. Each article is date-stamped to reflect when they were last updated. The PEOPLE Health Squad In the age of COVID and vaccine misinformation, no topic requires expert precision and more intense fact-checking than health coverage. To that end, our health team relies on the PEOPLE Health Squad, a team of doctors with specialties in many different areas we have at the ready, to explain and put into context everything from the latest recommendations on booster shots to that episode of And Just Like That that covered perimenopausal menstruation. We told you we take this stuff seriously. Sources Our writers and editors adhere to strict sourcing standards in all our articles. All facts and claims are backed up by at least one reputable source, and we aim to be transparent as to the origin of information in any developing situation. In our crime coverage, or in the case of a major disaster, where first responders and law enforcement respond to the scene, we rely on the district's Public Information Officer, interviews directly with members of law enforcement and court documents for the facts of the case. We always make every effort to reach out to legal representation for all defendants, or any individuals that are profiled in our coverage. PEOPLE journalists often receive information from trustworthy confidential sources whose names are withheld from publication. We want you to understand that these sources are not "anonymous" but are known to the PEOPLE team. They are granted confidentiality for publication purposes and the information they provide is verified with other sources. When we grant confidentiality to sources, we aim to provide context to our readers about the reasons they are not named. Getty Editorial Independence and Impartiality At PEOPLE, we never pay for stories or tips, as we believe it can compromise the integrity of our journalism. Likewise, we do not accept monetary compensation in exchange for coverage of products. Our writers and editors are prohibited from giving preferential treatment to any outside resource (company, publication, video, affiliate, website) based on their relationship with the person or company who authors or owns that resource. Each staff member and contributor is held to a high standard of honesty and transparency. Our goal at PEOPLE is to provide original, unbiased, credible content. We expect all contributors on the network to abide by all applicable laws, standards, and accepted journalistic practices, including: Dotdash Meredith Content Integrity Promise Copyright Law of the United States FTC Guidelines on Disclosures Fair Use Courtesy DDM. Shopping Recommendations Part of our mission at PEOPLE is to provide you with thorough, unbiased shopping information. We cover everything from the latest celebrity trends, the best sales, as well as our PEOPLE Tested program which covers everything from skincare to kitchen gadgets. In our PEOPLE Tested program, we do the heavy lifting by running products through vigorous testing at one of our three testing labs throughout the country. Here, we test products against a comprehensive methodology that rates products on various attributes (think performance, durability, ease of use, etc.). No product makes it into our Pet Awards, Beauty Awards, or Food Awards packages without rigorous testing by a panel of editors and experts. Our goal is to provide you with as much information as possible before you decide to buy something. These product recommendations are purely editorial, and we may receive a commission on any purchases that you make. Learn more about our testing methodology here .

To that end, our health team relies on the PEOPLE Health Squad, a team of doctors with specialties in many different areas we have at the ready, to explain and put into context everything from the latest recommendations on booster shots to that episode of And Just Like That that covered perimenopausal menstruation.

All facts and claims are backed up by at least one reputable source, and we aim to be transparent as to the origin of information in any developing situation.

He joined the publication on the crime beat. People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 10, 2023 02:16PM EDT President Bill Clinton stands behind Ruth Bader Ginsburg as she is sworn-in to serve on the Supreme Court on Aug. 10, 1993. Photo: AP Photo/Barry Thumma Thirty years ago, President Bill Clinton introduced the world to his first Supreme Court nominee, then-D.C. Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg , calling her a "path-breaking attorney" and "person of immense character" whom he trusted to approach the job with wisdom and fairness. On Aug. 10, 1993, after being confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a bipartisan 96-3 vote, Judge Ginsburg took the oath of office and became Justice Ginsburg, serving on the nation's highest court for nearly three decades until her death — and becoming a cultural juggernaut along the way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Life in Pictures "When I appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, I knew it would be one of the most important decisions I would make in my presidency," Clinton, 76, tells PEOPLE in a statement on the 30th anniversary of her swearing-in. "I had reviewed dozens of candidates and carefully studied their records, and she stood out for her compelling life story, her landmark legal victories on behalf of women, and her unique combination of intelligence, rigorous analysis, and sense of humor," he continues. "I interviewed her in the White House residence on a Sunday evening and I knew early in the conversation that she was the right person for the job."

AP Photo/Dennis Cook "Over the next 27 years on the Court, she far exceeded even my wildest hopes — advancing our rights and liberties, defending the Constitution, and making our union more perfect," Clinton says. "Along the way, she became a cultural icon because people admired her brilliance, identified with her story, and appreciated the way she redefined what strength and power look like." Ginsburg earned a reputation for authoring passionate dissenting opinions and repeatedly defending human rights as it pertained to gender equality, abortion access and voting rights. Perhaps more than any other Supreme Court justice in memory, Ginsburg's popularity on the bench also broke into pop culture — she was not only depicted on T-shirts, with bobbleheads and in children's costumes , but also earned affectionate references in TV shows and movies including Saturday Night Live , New Girl , The Good Place , Deadpool 2 and The Lego Movie 2 .

She left PEOPLE in 2023. People Editorial Guidelines Published on December 16, 2021 04:12PM EST Bill Clinton says he's feeling "fine" after a serious illness left him delirious and in intensive care for five days in October. "I feel better than I have in two years," the former president tells PEOPLE during an interview about his video lecture series, President Bill Clinton Teaches Inclusive Leadership , which launched Thursday on MasterClass . Clinton says his visit to the University of California, Irvine Medical Center was the result of a "longstanding infection that was essentially in hiding." "I knew I had it 15 months ago," he tells PEOPLE. "I took a six-day antibiotic treatment. We thought it was okay, and it wasn't. So it came out, got in my bloodstream. And I was delirious for a couple of days." Chelsea Clinton Celebrates with Her Parents Bill and Hillary After Completing N.Y.C.

Still, there is a lingering side effect from the fever — though it's not dangerous or even medical. "I had two days where I think the young men who were here with me probably took notes on all the crazy things I said," Clinton says of his bout with deliriousness. "I'll probably have to live with it for the rest of my life."

"I get up every day and I do a couple of Sudoku puzzles and I do the spelling bee in the New York Times , which is a lot of fun." His wife — and even their daughter, Chelsea — often joins in on the fun, the former president added.

Bill first took office in 1993 and was re-elected in 1996. The Easter Egg Roll is a longstanding White House tradition, which first began in 1878 under then-President Rutherford B. Hayes. Hillary's 2022 Easter celebration comes shortly after she faced quarantine after a bout of COVID-19. The politician, 74, came down with the virus at the end of March. Hillary Clinton Tests Positive for COVID: 'I've Got Some Mild Cold Symptoms But Am Feeling Fine' She announced her diagnosis on March 22, sharing: "I've got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine. I'm more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already!" Opening up to actress Kate McKinnon (who portrayed her on Saturday Night Live ) on the season finale of her podcast You and Me Both with Hillary Clinton , Hillary addressed her "really mild" case of COVID-19 and said she mostly only felt "so tired" throughout the ordeal.

In honor of Easter Sunday, Hillary shared a throwback picture from her White House days with husband and former President Bill Clinton , where the two celebrated alongside a life-size bunny mascot.

Celebrity Celebrity Weddings Celebrity Wedding Dresses Hillary Clinton Reveals the Story Behind Her Off-the-Rack Wedding Dress from Dillard's In an interview for The Drew Barrymore Show , Hillary Clinton opened up about her wedding style By Michelle Lee Michelle Lee Editorial Assistant, Style & Beauty, PEOPLE People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 14, 2022 09:34PM EDT Photo: The Drew Barrymore Show/Ash Bean Hillary Clinton took the spontaneous route when it came to saying yes to the dress. During an interview for an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show , set to air Thursday, host Drew Barrymore asked Hilary whether or not her wedding dress was really purchased from Dillard's, to which she simply responded, "Yes it is." Hillary's daughter Chelsea Clinton , 42, who accompanied her mom on the show, then prompted Barrymore to inquire about how many attempts it took before finding the dress. "Only one, I found what I wanted," Hillary, 74, admitted, which earned a shocked look from the Wedding Singer actress. "But here's what happened," Hillary went on to explain. "My husband [Bill Clinton] had asked me to marry him twice, and I said, 'Not now, no.' The third time was the charm. And then he said, 'Well let's hurry up and do it before you change your mind'." Hillary Clinton/instagram Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Announce New Docuseries 'Gutsy', Featuring Conversations with Trailblazing Women It turns out, finding a dress totally escaped Hillary's mind and by her wedding weekend a trip to the department store was the only solution. The dress in question is a bohemian smock dress with bell sleeves and crochet lace detail. In February 2020, the former Secretary of State shared a throwback photo from their wedding day in 1975 on Instagram that showed off the wedding-day piece as well as Bill's groom suit (which he paired with a polka dot tie). Hillary has previously opened up about her trademark style, including her signature pantsuits . Speaking to CBS News on Sept. 6, ahead of the premiere of Gutsy , the Clintons' Apple TV + docuseries inspired by their best-selling The Book of Gutsy Women , the former first lady revealed that her now-uniform tracks back to her decision to wear a skirt during a state visit to Brazil. Cindy Ord/Getty Images Hillary Clinton Says She Started Wearing Pantsuits After 'Suggestive' Photos Came Out in Brazil "I was sitting on a couch and the press was let in," Hillary told CBS anchor Norah O'Donnell. "There were a bunch of them shooting up." She then revealed that the photos were later used in lingerie ads. "All of a sudden, the White House gets alerted to these billboards that show me sitting down with, I thought my legs [were] together, but the way it's shot, it's sort of suggestive." The incident in Brazil wasn't the only uncomfortable encounter. "I'd be on a stage, I'd be climbing stairs, and they'd be below me," the best-selling author shared. "I just couldn't deal with it. So, I started wearing pants." Empowering women is also the premise of Hillary's work, from her legislative action to her on-screen projects to her red carpet fashion. In May, she attended the 2022 Met Gala in an ensemble dedicated to a catalog of powerful history-making women. Designed by Joseph Altuzarra, her burgundy off-the-shoulder gown was embroidered with the names of 60 famous women in American history, Vogue reported. Getty Read the Names of Women in History Hillary Clinton Admires, Stitched into Her Met Gala Gown "A lot of these names are going to be well known to be people, but some of them are women who inspired me that maybe others don't know that much about," Hillary told the publication. Rosa Parks, Lady Bird Johnson, Clara Barton, Harriet Tubman and Hillary's mother, Dorothy Rodham as well as Elizabeth Blackwell and Rebecca Lee Crumpler, were some of the figures featured on the dress' neckline and hem.

"When someone like Hillary goes to The Met, it's not just, like, 'There's Hillary at The Met and she's wearing a dress.' It has a lot of significance," Altuzarra told the outlet on dressing the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. "I felt like I had to be very thoughtful about what the dress would mean to the theme and to the occasion." For the French-American designer, the ensemble was also an homage to the "homemakers, and quilters, and seamstresses" from 1870-1890s, the decades referenced in the gala's "Gilded Glamour" dress code.

Entertainment Books Memoirs Bill Clinton’s Memoir Citizen Centers Our Common Humanity: ‘Live in the Present, for the Future’ (Exclusive) The book focuses on the years after the former president left the White House as he shares stories from his post-politics career By Lizz Schumer Lizz Schumer Lizz Schumer is the senior books editor at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024. Her work has previously appeared in Good Housekeeping, Woman's Day, Prevention, The New York Times, and others. People Editorial Guidelines Published on November 19, 2024 08:00AM EST Comments Bill Clinton and his new book 'Citizen'. Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty, Knopf President Bill Clinton left the White House on Jan. 20, 2001, and stepped into a new phase of his life and career — as a private citizen. His new book, Citizen: My Life After the White House , out Nov. 19 from Alfred A. Knopf, is the former president's first-person account of the subsequent years. Those years saw him embark on public service and advocacy, coming to the aid of people in India and Haiti, Indonesia and Louisiana, Northern Ireland and South Africa and just about everywhere in between, all while supporting wife Hillary Clinton on her career as senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate. Bill Clinton Reveals 12 Simple Rules for Surviving Politics: Read Them Here (Exclusive) In reflecting on the decades since he left office, Clinton, 78, jokes he initially "felt lost whenever I walked into a room because no one played a song to mark my arrival." But in reality, he tells PEOPLE the change was a welcome one because it allowed him to turn his attention toward what matters most: the human element. In the book, he sets out the maxim: "live in the present, for the future." 'Citizen' by Bill Clinton. Knopf "You need to be thinking about what you're gonna do today that will help tomorrow. I just decided that's the way I would think all the time: What can I do today? How can I move the law forward on something I care about?" he says, of the principle that has dictated his life, ever since. Peppered with stories from people he's met along the way — from his former teachers to Haitian artists to fellow public figures — Citizen keeps that focus front and center, too. And he urges his readers to do the same, regardless of their sphere of influence. "It's so easy, especially when you're in politics, but it's also easy if you're overwhelmed with raising kids or if you're overwhelmed with whatever else is going on in your life to forget that at the base of all your interactions, there are people involved," Clinton explains. "And that human nature tends to repeat itself down through the centuries in the millennia. We just get shiny new toys to do what we have been pre-mortally predisposed to do." See Every Time Former U.S. Presidents Have Gotten Together The importance of taking human nature into account isn't lost on the former president, whose book also addresses the concept of "two Americas" and political divisions that have existed since before the country did. Bill Clinton attends the annual Charity Day hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald and The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund on Sept. 11, 2023 in New York City. Eugene Gologursky/Getty "There are other people who believe that all that matters is politics," he acknowledges. "And whoever you are, you're only worth anything depending on whose side you're on ... Our differences make life more interesting, but they're only possible to have a positive impact when our common humanity matters more." His advice for moving forward? "I think the trick is gonna be how do you keep showing up for what you believe, but do it with an outstretched hand rather than a clenched fist," Clinton advises. "Down deep, most people want the same thing ...  It's mostly a war that we all fight within."

In a statement on X Monday, Dec. 23, Angel Ureña, deputy chief of staff to Clinton, 78, said he was “admitted to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital for testing and observation after developing a fever."

"The former president will be fine," the insider continued. "He developed a fever and wanted to be checked out. He is awake and alert." Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, August 2024.

Getty During a Nov. 25 appearance on Live with Kelly and Mark , Bill said his role as former president of the United States sometimes takes a back seat to another important title. "Depends on what day it is. Some days it's the least most powerful. But it has the longest cool list," Bill joked with Kelly Ripa , 54, about his “powerful position” of “being Pop-Pop of the family.” Bill is grandfather to daughter Chelsea Clinton's three kids: Charlotte, 10, Aidan, 8, and Jasper, 5. When Mark Consuelos , 53, asked the politician how he landed on the moniker, Bill explained it’s a nickname that’s been in their family for a while: "It's what Chelsea called Hillary's dad. And you know, we have a great time together. It's a good deal.” In 2021, Bill told PEOPLE his Christmas plans usually include gathering him and Hillary visiting Chelsea’s family. "We always go down on Christmas Eve, spend the night and have Christmas Day with them," he said at the time. "And I think it's the right thing to do, intergenerationally. And then we normally go to the train display at the Bronx Zoo. It's great." Close Leave a Comment Politics Politics Bill Clinton Admitted to D.C.

When the actor, comedian and host launched The Arsenio Hall Show in 1989, he created a platform to help pave the way for other Black entertainers by introducing them to the world. "It was my lucky timing–meets–pop culture!" Hall, 67, exclusively tells PEOPLE. "Every artist in showbiz wasn't a good fit for The Tonight Show audience in those days. I created a show for people who didn't have a show. A place for [MC] Hammer , Prince , New Edition and New Kids on the Block . A place for comics from Chris Rock and Lea DeLaria to George Lopez !"

"Take Snoop Dogg ," Hall recalls. "I remember telling Paramount executives about this guy, Calvin Broadus … that Dr. Dre told me about. He wasn't famous, so it wasn't an easy sell. But I knew Snoop Dogg was special. It was at a time when focus groups thought my show was too Black! Snoop came on and did something called 'freestyle.'" Hall jokes that Snoop's improv rhyming was decidedly not a favorite of the Paramount lawyers, who had to be ready to censor the performance at any time. But still, he says, "You didn't see [that] on a television talk show back then. He killed! Murdered! To this day Snoop is a household name!" Snoop Dogg Says He 'Can't Believe' He's Performing at Super Bowl Halftime Show: 'Dream Come True' Mike Windle/Getty Images Because The Arsenio Hall Show was around before social media, too, Hall became virtually the only avenue through which the soon-to-be stars who appeared on his show could "break ground" with their "young audiences." One of those soon-to-be '90s stars even famously stopped by The Arsenio Hall Show to play the saxophone. "I definitely saw the campaign road to the White House change with my Bill Clinton sax sit-in and interview," Hall says. "When I grew up, you went on Meet the Press when you ran for the highest office in the land. Now, you almost have to do Jimmy Kimmel [Live] if you want to be President of the United States. I also think [my show] showed Hollywood that ratings could be garnered with hip-hop and a potpourri of new Black talent never heard of by the mainstream."

"I could never have imagined what happened to me on Paramount's stage 29," says Hall of his achievements. "I believe that anybody who succeeds in show business is living a dream. I 'imagined' getting my degree from Kent State. A person could never 'imagine' what's happened to me since the day I arrived in Hollywood." He continues, "As a kid, I used to do a talk show in my basement. But honestly I thought, actually everyone thought, that I was just a weird kid with a strange name.

She first joined PEOPLE in 2016. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 28, 2022 04:24PM EST Karen Hinton. Photo: Sartoris Literary Group When Karen Hinton first heard Charlotte Bennett 's allegation last year of being sexually harassed by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo , she curled up into the "fetal position" on her couch. "I was astounded by the news of what he was saying and doing with the women in his own office — and the fact that they were so young, inexperienced and vulnerable," says Hinton, a former Cuomo aide who first joined his team as press secretary in 1995, when he was an assistant housing secretary. "I had seen the flirting, and I know what had happened to me, but I never thought that, at his age ... He knew better. He knew not to do what he was doing," Hinton tells PEOPLE. "Yet he did it anyway." Hinton's complicated relationship with Cuomo is just a few chapters in her new memoir, Penis Politics , which is first and foremost a nuanced coming-of-age story, revealing a woman beset with her own personal challenges. In an interview, Hinton discussed her book and how she feels her journey is tied to the culture of harassment that women continue to face, decades after her own entry into politics. Bennett, the other Cuomo aide, first came forward in an interview published with The New York Times in February 2021 as part of a wave of women whose stories ultimately ended Cuomo's once-lauded career. Bennett alleged that he had harassed her the year before while she was serving as an executive assistant and health policy adviser in the governor's administration. "I understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and felt horribly uncomfortable and scared," Bennett said then. An independent investigation concluded Cuomo had harassed multiple women, leading to his resignation last year. He has maintained he "never inappropriately touched anybody" or intentionally committed wrongdoing but apologized for what he insisted was inadvertent behavior. He has not been charged with a crime. Hinton, a rural-Mississippi native, has had her own problematic experiences with powerful men — Cuomo included. She moved to Washington, D.C., in the late 1980s and built a career in the halls of power as an aide first to Cuomo and later for future New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The former spokeswoman had planned to detail some of her experiences in the testosterone-fueled political arena in the early drafts of Penis Politics . But when a growing list of women came forward with harassment allegations against Cuomo beginning in December 2020 she decided to revisit her book. Hinton wanted to provide her own testimony about Cuomo's inappropriate behavior toward herself and other women decades before, she says. (Cuomo's team has repeatedly challenged Hinton's account and did so again for this piece. They have dismissed her as a "known antagonist.") "I hope readers will take the truths from my past and that will help strengthen their own truths, from both past and the present," she says. Sartoris Literary Group Penis Politics has its share of headline-grabbing details, some of which stirred up the tabloids ahead of the memoir's release in December. Hinton recalls Cuomo's bullying tactics toward his staff, his unwanted sexual advance to her in 2000 and then-President Bill Clinton 's invitation to his hotel room when she was just 26 years old that left her "humiliated." But Penis Politics is more than just a titillating title and a list of humiliations endured and overcome. Hinton also remembers growing up in rural Mississippi, where she witnessed racial injustice, and shares how she went from journalism to politics in order to better fight for social causes that continue to matter deeply to her. A through-line in Hinton's book is how the culture of sexual harassment and gender politics that has been plaguing her throughout her life remains a problem for women to this day. She learned early on to "speak up, not shut up," she says. Now she's found a new source of inspiration watching young women like Bennett come forward. "I told my story," she says. "I want other women to tell their own stories." Writing as a Form of 'Healing' In April 2017, Hinton suffered a traumatic brain injury after an accident at her local gym. She doesn't remember what happened, but was later told by her husband and doctors that she was "thrown" from a treadmill and hit her head hard on the floor, according to her memoir. The cement floor was covered by only a thin layer of carpet. In the years since, she has worked hard to regain her speech, mobility and memory, though her recovery is ongoing. Her husband, Howard Glaser, another former aide to Cuomo, said her first fully-formed sentence was "Get me the f--- out of here." (She has retained her long-term memory but still has difficulty with short-term memory.) In recent years, her husband encouraged her to revisit her past to help her regain her writing ability and, later, to publish the account of her years in politics. It was during the writing process that Hinton realized how much an incident during her teenage years had impacted her life — and interactions with men — going forward. In Penis Politics , she writes that her childhood best friend, Janice, was 16 years old when Janice was raped by a school athletic official. Janice eventually dropped out of high school, Hinton writes, and she faced other losses in life, including the death of her young daughter. Janice died by suicide when she was 51. Watching her friend's early trauma "shaped my life immensely," Hinton says of the sexual assault, which went unreported. "I never realized it, though, until the accident [on the treadmill years later]. I almost died, and it brought back memories that I had either forgotten or never really grasped the understanding of." Hinton recovering from surgery after her accident. Courtesy Karen Hinton Hinton says she realized that many of her life choices were affected by Janice's story. "I felt like I had failed her because we never talked about what happened. We never told anybody what happened. It was a secret that she demanded we keep," says Hinton. "And I felt then, and I feel now, that I let her down." From then on, Hinton says, "I pushed myself to do things that would normally frighten me and scare me, but I took them on anyway." Power Play on Capitol Hill When Hinton arrived in D.C. in the '80s, she'd already had some experience dealing with the imbalances between men and women in the world of Southern politics. (She had worked as a journalist in Mississippi and as a press secretary for Robert Clark, a Black Mississippi legislator, during his 1984 congressional bid. She came to D.C. to work for Mike Espy, helping him become Mississippi's first Black congressman since the Civil War.) But Hinton says that Washington's sexual dysfunction was even more intense. "When I get to D.C., I'm somewhat prepared, but Capitol Hill was a bee's nest of men who were flirting, making sexually-laden comments to women who either worked in the office or worked around them," says Hinton. "There was harassment ... And then just trying to get the woman to sleep with them." Hinton experienced much of this during her four-and-a-half years working with Cuomo when he was in the Clinton administration. Their relationship was complicated from the start. These days, both Cuomo and Hinton have a lot to say about each other. When contacted about this story, the former governor's spokesman cast Hinton as a manipulator and liar, citing past instances (and an email) when she had spoken in flattering tones of her former boss. "In 2018, when Ms. Hinton was not consumed with chasing headlines to sell a book, she wrote: 'I've been fortunate to have male bosses, like Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio, who know how to be respectful of women even while being no-nonsense managers,' " the spokesman said. "It's clear that her opinion of Governor Cuomo changes depending on whether he could be personally helpful to her or whether she can personally profit off his name. Consider that when gauging her credibility and this latest transparent attempt to rewrite history." There is no love lost on either side. Hinton responded to this depiction with a fierce rebuttal of her own, which Cuomo's team then pushed back on. ("Cuomo's statements about me only further expose the real Andrew Cuomo: a man obsessed with power, control and intimidation," Hinton said.) Despite what she has said before, she insists now that she decided to join her voice with Cuomo's other accusers, adding tinder to the inferno that left his reputation in ashes. Hinton says that at first she "loved" working with Cuomo, who was then the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's assistant secretary. She was excited to work for the big-personality Democrat because he prioritized finding solutions to homelessness and other issues she cared about deeply. "I was very attracted to that, even though other people would say, 'Well, he's difficult. He's arrogant. He's bullying me. He's just a pain in the butt,' " Hinton remembers. After working in D.C. for eight years, Hinton says she had no problem "push[ing] back" when Cuomo "attacked" or "criticized" her on an issue. Hinton says she also shut down his attempts at flirting. Andrew Cuomo and Bill Clinton. Andrew Burton/Getty Images "Did he flirt with me? Sure. But he flirted with a lot of women," says Hinton. "You just had to ignore it. I did, I just ignored it." "I would say, 'I don't have time for that! Enough with your compliments about my dress or my hair or my makeup or whatever. We got to stuff to do here, here are the issues,' " she says. "And then we would often argue about the issues." In addition to her own interactions with Cuomo — which she characterizes as pretty standard behavior for men of that ilk and era — Hinton also writes about stories that her colleagues shared with her. A "close friend" of Hinton's who worked at HUD told her that "she mentally drew a curtain in front of her face" in order to survive the "hours of bullying, unreasonable demands and public humiliation by Andrew," according to Penis Politics . Uncomfortable Encounters Hinton says that her relationship with Cuomo became more volatile after she decided to come forward about then-President Clinton to detail a 1984 encounter she had with him when he was still the governor of Arkansas. Hinton went on the record for Washington Post reporter Michael Isikoff, whose book Uncovering Clinton was published in 1999. In it, Hinton details her chance meeting with the future president at a restaurant where she remembers they talked intensively about policy. Clinton then handed Hinton, just 26 years old at the time, a napkin with his hotel name and room number on it, according to Penis Politics . "I was humiliated," recalls Hinton, who says Clinton's philandering ways were common knowledge in the South even then. "When he gave me the napkin, I was completely downfallen because I knew he wasn't interested in my thoughts. So, I was devastated by that." (In the years since, the allegation has bubbled up in news stories. President Clinton has repeatedly decline to comment.) RELATED VIDEO: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Resigns Hinton says that she decided to come forward in the '90s about her encounter with Clinton in part because she was disgusted by how Monica Lewinksy — a former White House intern whose affair with the president would fuel his impeachment trial — was being treated. "I am appalled by the fact that they are calling her a bimbo and blaming her for the whole thing," Hinton says now. "And I know she's telling the truth." When Isikoff's book was published, Hinton wasn't fired, even though Cuomo worked closely with the Clinton White House. Instead, Hinton claims, Cuomo privately requested that she not be confirmed for the assistant secretary for public affairs position. She says he took it a step further when Hinton requested to go to Russia with her then-husband Pat for five days to adopt a 13-month-old girl. (By this time, Hinton had had two miscarriages and failed fertility treatments.) Cuomo was less than understanding, Hinton remembers. He told her, according to her memoir, "Why don't you just let Pat go get your daughter?" When Hinton returned, after less than a week away, she says Cuomo had given her job to someone else. Hinton was "livid," she says. She finally quit after they got into a yelling match over a project about which she was passionate. Despite their phone call ending with a mutual "f--- you!", Hinton served as a consultant for Cuomo in the summer of 2000. She was tasked with promoting his HUD events on the West Coast, tied to the upcoming Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. It was while in this role, Hinton says, that Cuomo asked her to come to his hotel room to chat, like they'd done before, to discuss business. But she remembers that this interaction was different. Hinton says Cuomo started asking about her marriage and discussing his own. She became increasingly "uncomfortable" and started to leave. "And [Cuomo] says, 'Well, wait.' And he embraces me," Hinton says. "And, at first, I think it's just a get-to-know-you-better hug, but he pulls me close and it's very intimate. And honestly, I can tell he was aroused." When Hinton pulled away, she says, Cuomo "pulls me back and says, 'We have to take care of each other. Can you do that? I can do that. Can you do that?' " Hinton didn't know what to make of the question or the physical contact. She tried to leave again. "I said, 'I really need to go back and just get some rest. So, I'll see you tomorrow,' " Hinton says. "And we never talked about it after that because he knew I was saying no." Hinton has made this allegation before and it's been challenged by Cuomo's team. A spokesman for him told The Washington Post in a statement in March 2021 that Hinton's recollection was false and "reckless" on her part. "This did not happen," the spokesman said. "Karen Hinton is a known antagonist of the Governor's who is attempting to take advantage of this moment to score cheap points with made up allegations from 21 years ago. All women have the right to come forward and tell their story — however, it's also the responsibility of the press to consider self-motivation. This is reckless." 'One D--- to Rule Them All' Hinton had to deal with Cuomo again when she became press secretary to Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015. Her appointment stirred up even more antagonism between the two politicians, whose bitter feud was the talk of New York politics for years. Hinton only held the position for 12 months, but she came away with one big lesson. "When it comes to politically-motivated men, for the most part, it's always about one d--- to rule us all," says Hinton, referencing a chapter in her book called "One D--- to Rule Them All." The experience reaffirmed what Hinton knew about ego and masculinity in politics. But she has hope for the women who decide to speak up — especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement and Cuomo's sudden fall. "Men and women in New York grew to hate Andrew, the same way Bill hated him," says Hinton. "But they didn't have the control, the power to end his political career. But the 11 women did — they did it." Penis Politics is on sale now. Close Celebrity Celebrity Celebrity News Celebrity News Celebrity Legal & Lawsuits Celebrity Legal & Lawsuits Andrew Cuomo's Former Press Secretary on Surviving Decades of Working for Powerful Men: 'A Bee's Nest' "I hope readers will take the truths from my past and that will help strengthen their own truths, from both past and the present," Karen Hinton says about her new memoir By Karen Hinton. Photo: Sartoris Literary Group When Karen Hinton first heard Charlotte Bennett 's allegation last year of being sexually harassed by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo , she curled up into the "fetal position" on her couch. "I was astounded by the news of what he was saying and doing with the women in his own office — and the fact that they were so young, inexperienced and vulnerable," says Hinton, a former Cuomo aide who first joined his team as press secretary in 1995, when he was an assistant housing secretary. "I had seen the flirting, and I know what had happened to me, but I never thought that, at his age ... He knew better. He knew not to do what he was doing," Hinton tells PEOPLE. "Yet he did it anyway." Hinton's complicated relationship with Cuomo is just a few chapters in her new memoir, Penis Politics , which is first and foremost a nuanced coming-of-age story, revealing a woman beset with her own personal challenges. In an interview, Hinton discussed her book and how she feels her journey is tied to the culture of harassment that women continue to face, decades after her own entry into politics. Bennett, the other Cuomo aide, first came forward in an interview published with The New York Times in February 2021 as part of a wave of women whose stories ultimately ended Cuomo's once-lauded career. Bennett alleged that he had harassed her the year before while she was serving as an executive assistant and health policy adviser in the governor's administration. "I understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and felt horribly uncomfortable and scared," Bennett said then. An independent investigation concluded Cuomo had harassed multiple women, leading to his resignation last year. He has maintained he "never inappropriately touched anybody" or intentionally committed wrongdoing but apologized for what he insisted was inadvertent behavior. He has not been charged with a crime. Hinton, a rural-Mississippi native, has had her own problematic experiences with powerful men — Cuomo included. She moved to Washington, D.C., in the late 1980s and built a career in the halls of power as an aide first to Cuomo and later for future New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The former spokeswoman had planned to detail some of her experiences in the testosterone-fueled political arena in the early drafts of Penis Politics . But when a growing list of women came forward with harassment allegations against Cuomo beginning in December 2020 she decided to revisit her book. Hinton wanted to provide her own testimony about Cuomo's inappropriate behavior toward herself and other women decades before, she says. (Cuomo's team has repeatedly challenged Hinton's account and did so again for this piece. They have dismissed her as a "known antagonist.") "I hope readers will take the truths from my past and that will help strengthen their own truths, from both past and the present," she says. Sartoris Literary Group Penis Politics has its share of headline-grabbing details, some of which stirred up the tabloids ahead of the memoir's release in December. Hinton recalls Cuomo's bullying tactics toward his staff, his unwanted sexual advance to her in 2000 and then-President Bill Clinton 's invitation to his hotel room when she was just 26 years old that left her "humiliated." But Penis Politics is more than just a titillating title and a list of humiliations endured and overcome. Hinton also remembers growing up in rural Mississippi, where she witnessed racial injustice, and shares how she went from journalism to politics in order to better fight for social causes that continue to matter deeply to her. A through-line in Hinton's book is how the culture of sexual harassment and gender politics that has been plaguing her throughout her life remains a problem for women to this day. She learned early on to "speak up, not shut up," she says. Now she's found a new source of inspiration watching young women like Bennett come forward. "I told my story," she says. "I want other women to tell their own stories." Writing as a Form of 'Healing' Writing as a Form of 'Healing' In April 2017, Hinton suffered a traumatic brain injury after an accident at her local gym. She doesn't remember what happened, but was later told by her husband and doctors that she was "thrown" from a treadmill and hit her head hard on the floor, according to her memoir. The cement floor was covered by only a thin layer of carpet. In the years since, she has worked hard to regain her speech, mobility and memory, though her recovery is ongoing. Her husband, Howard Glaser, another former aide to Cuomo, said her first fully-formed sentence was "Get me the f--- out of here." (She has retained her long-term memory but still has difficulty with short-term memory.) In recent years, her husband encouraged her to revisit her past to help her regain her writing ability and, later, to publish the account of her years in politics. It was during the writing process that Hinton realized how much an incident during her teenage years had impacted her life — and interactions with men — going forward. In Penis Politics , she writes that her childhood best friend, Janice, was 16 years old when Janice was raped by a school athletic official. Janice eventually dropped out of high school, Hinton writes, and she faced other losses in life, including the death of her young daughter. Janice died by suicide when she was 51. Watching her friend's early trauma "shaped my life immensely," Hinton says of the sexual assault, which went unreported. "I never realized it, though, until the accident [on the treadmill years later]. I almost died, and it brought back memories that I had either forgotten or never really grasped the understanding of." Hinton recovering from surgery after her accident. Courtesy Karen Hinton Hinton says she realized that many of her life choices were affected by Janice's story. "I felt like I had failed her because we never talked about what happened. We never told anybody what happened. It was a secret that she demanded we keep," says Hinton. "And I felt then, and I feel now, that I let her down." From then on, Hinton says, "I pushed myself to do things that would normally frighten me and scare me, but I took them on anyway." Power Play on Capitol Hill Power Play on Capitol Hill When Hinton arrived in D.C. in the '80s, she'd already had some experience dealing with the imbalances between men and women in the world of Southern politics. (She had worked as a journalist in Mississippi and as a press secretary for Robert Clark, a Black Mississippi legislator, during his 1984 congressional bid. She came to D.C. to work for Mike Espy, helping him become Mississippi's first Black congressman since the Civil War.) But Hinton says that Washington's sexual dysfunction was even more intense. "When I get to D.C., I'm somewhat prepared, but Capitol Hill was a bee's nest of men who were flirting, making sexually-laden comments to women who either worked in the office or worked around them," says Hinton. "There was harassment ... And then just trying to get the woman to sleep with them."

The White House Historical Association announced Mesnier's death in a statement on its website, saying the chef died "August 26, 2022, following a short illness." According to the association, Mesnier's career began at age 14, when he left home "with a cardboard suitcase and five francs" to work as an apprentice at the Patisserie Maurivard in Besançon, France. By 1967, he had landed a role as pastry chef at the Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia — but he would be lured away by then-first lady Rosalynn Carter in 1979. Secrets from the White House Kitchen, According to the Chefs: 'For the First Two Weeks I Was Scared to Death' Mesnier's White House tenure spanned five presidencies. The French-born chef was hired during Jimmy Carter 's presidency and retired in 2004 under George W. Bush . As White House pastry chef, Mesnier was best known for his fruit desserts, and his ornate gingerbread White Houses that came to life each holiday season. Following the announcement of his passing, former presidents and first ladies alike took to social media to share their memories of Mesnier. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library shared a photo of Mesnier with a young Amy and James Carter on Twitter, writing that the chef was "hired by Mrs. Carter for his talent with lighter desserts." "Roland Mesnier was a master chef and a delightful man," former President Bill Clinton wrote. "His endless list of unique creations made every White House meal special, from State dinners to family birthdays to evening meals with desserts he knew Chelsea, Hillary and I loved. His life and work were blessings to many." Former first lady Hillary Clinton shared her own fond memories of the chef, writing that Mesnier "loved making people smile with his beautiful creations, including his famous gingerbread houses at Christmas. He will be missed!" The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea , also shared her condolences, along with a photo of she and Mesnier taken when she was first daughter. "Deeply saddened by the passing of Roland Mesnier, the former White House pastry chef who taught me so much (including how to make a terrific pie crust) & brought joy to many people who lived, worked & visited the White House over many years," Chelsea wrote on Twitter. "Holding all who love him in my heart. The Reagan Institute echoed the sentiment, saying Mesnier's "passion, commitment, and love for his work will always be remembered."

Mesnier has spoken openly about the impact of his time in the White House, saying in one public appearance that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen with the encouragement of Ms. Carter, who recently turned 95 . "I left my home one morning as a French man, and returned the same evening as an American citizen," Mesnier said, during a 2016 talk at Samford University . "Only in America can you get such a gift." Mesnier is survived by his son, George.

By 1967, he had landed a role as pastry chef at the Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia — but he would be lured away by then-first lady Rosalynn Carter in 1979. Secrets from the White House Kitchen, According to the Chefs: 'For the First Two Weeks I Was Scared to Death' Mesnier's White House tenure spanned five presidencies. The French-born chef was hired during Jimmy Carter 's presidency and retired in 2004 under George W. Bush . As White House pastry chef, Mesnier was best known for his fruit desserts, and his ornate gingerbread White Houses that came to life each holiday season. Following the announcement of his passing, former presidents and first ladies alike took to social media to share their memories of Mesnier. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library shared a photo of Mesnier with a young Amy and James Carter on Twitter, writing that the chef was "hired by Mrs. Carter for his talent with lighter desserts." "Roland Mesnier was a master chef and a delightful man," former President Bill Clinton wrote. "His endless list of unique creations made every White House meal special, from State dinners to family birthdays to evening meals with desserts he knew Chelsea, Hillary and I loved. His life and work were blessings to many." Former first lady Hillary Clinton shared her own fond memories of the chef, writing that Mesnier "loved making people smile with his beautiful creations, including his famous gingerbread houses at Christmas. He will be missed!" The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea , also shared her condolences, along with a photo of she and Mesnier taken when she was first daughter. "Deeply saddened by the passing of Roland Mesnier, the former White House pastry chef who taught me so much (including how to make a terrific pie crust) & brought joy to many people who lived, worked & visited the White House over many years," Chelsea wrote on Twitter. "Holding all who love him in my heart.  The Reagan Institute echoed the sentiment, saying Mesnier's "passion, commitment, and love for his work will always be remembered."

Mesnier has spoken openly about the impact of his time in the White House, saying in one public appearance that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen with the encouragement of Ms. Carter, who recently turned 95 . "I left my home one morning as a French man, and returned the same evening as an American citizen," Mesnier said, during a 2016 talk at Samford University . "Only in America can you get such a gift." Mesnier is survived by his son, George.

She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 4, 2024 03:31PM EST President Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein. Photo: Taylor Hill/FilmMagic, New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP Bill Clinton 's office maintains that he "knows nothing" about Jeffrey Epstein 's "terrible crimes" after the former president was mentioned in newly unsealed court filings related to the deceased sex offender. In one court document made public on Wednesday evening, an alleged victim of Epstein claims that he once told her Clinton "likes them young, referring to girls." The large cache of documents stem from a 2015 lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Epstein (who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal conspiracy and sex trafficking charges) and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, and other related cases. The documents included a deposition from Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg who, under questioning from Giuffre's attorney, said of Epstein: "I knew he had dealings with Bill Clinton. I did not know they were friends until I read the Vanity Fair article about them going to Africa together." "Did Jeffrey ever talk to you about Bill Clinton?" the attorney then asked. "He said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls," Sjoberg responded. Elsewhere in the deposition, Sjoberg clarified that she never met Clinton or saw him on Epstein's island. Jeffrey Epstein Threatened Bill Gates Over Alleged Affair with Russian Bridge Player: Report Clinton did not object to the unsealing of the documents. In a statement to PEOPLE his spokesperson, Angel Ureña, noted that despite being mentioned in the documents, Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing. Adding that "it's been nearly 20 years since President Clinton last had contact with Epstein," Ureña referred PEOPLE to his 2019 statement that said, in part, "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York." Epstein Files Unsealed: Prince Andrew Accused of Groping Woman's Breast, and More Names and Allegations Clinton was among dozens of other John Does whose names were unsealed under court order on Wednesday. Elsewhere in Sjoberg's deposition, she alleged that Prince Andrew groped her breast at Epstein's New York City home in 2001 while posing for a group photo with Giuffre, Epstein, Maxwell and a puppet bearing Andrew's likeness. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Buckingham Palace had no comment when reached by PEOPLE Thursday. Giuffre herself has alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17. Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

"Well, I've tested positive for COVID. I've got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine," the politician, 74, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. " I'm more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already!" "Bill tested negative and is feeling fine.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki revealed earlier on Tuesday that she had also tested positive for COVID after meeting with President Joe Biden ahead of their trip to Europe. "Today, in preparation for travel to Europe, I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the President's trip to Europe," Psaki, 43, said in a statement released on Tuesday.

"I had two socially-distanced meetings with the President yesterday, and the President is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance," she said. "I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an abundance of transparency." Breakthrough cases of COVID — infections that occur in people who have been fully vaccinated against the virus — are possible and expected, as the vaccines are not 100 percent effective. Still, vaccinated people who test positive will likely be asymptomatic or experience a far milder illness than if they were not vaccinated. The majority of deaths from COVID — around 98 to 99 percent — are in unvaccinated people .

Bush to Tina Fey's Sarah Palin, these comedic superstars expertly portrayed U.S. political figures on the hit NBC sketch show By Stephanie Sengwe Updated on November 18, 2024 01:09PM EST 2 Comments Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin and Maya Rudolph. Photo: Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty(2); Will Heath/NBC Election years can be stressful. However, we can always count on Saturday Night Live to bring some levity in the midst of all the hard politics. The hit NBC sketch show has managed to snag some of the best actors and actresses to portray politicians in the history of its 50 years. From Will Ferrell 's impression of George W. Bush to Tina Fey 's take on Sarah Palin — for which she won an Emmy — the show has always managed to book comedians who can turn some shocking political moments into funny bits. Stars such as Dana Carvey , Kate McKinnon and Alec Baldwin have also lent their talents to satire our nation's top leaders. Below, see the comedians who have expertly portrayed politicians on Saturday Night Live. 01 of 18 Tina Fey as Sarah Palin Tina Fey as Sarah Palin. Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Ross D Franklin/AP/Shutterstock Who better to start with than the woman who won an Emmy award for her portrayal of Sarah Palin ? Tina Fey played the former governor of Alaska when she ran for vice president alongside Senator John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign. Speaking on whether or not she thought the famed impression was swaying peoples' perception of Palin, Fey told David Letterman , "I can't even sway people to watch 30 Rock ." "I can't even sway my kid to use the potty," she joked. "I can't sway anybody, but there's certainly been a strange reaction to it. I've [also] seen people who say, 'Oh, no, you're helping them.' " 02 of 18 Will Ferrell as George W. Bush Will Ferrell as George Bush. Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty;  Brooks Kraft/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Will Ferrell ran so Tina Fey could fly. Prior to the Palin impression, perhaps no other impersonation had garnered as much fanfare as Will Ferrell 's take on George W. Bush . His impression was so good, he even had the 43rd president believing he said a word that had totally been made up by the SNL cast. While visiting the Today show , which Bush's daughter Jenna Bush Hager co-hosts with Hoda Kotb , Jenna told Ferrell her dad had been convinced — for years — that he had said the word "strategery" while in debate with Al Gore . It wasn't until SNL creator Lorne Michaels told the former president that the word had, in fact, been made up by the SNL cast that he realized the truth. Ferrell had also been in on the joke the entire time. “Lorne Michaels told my dad, ‘You never said that,’ and he said, ‘What? I spent all those years [thinking I’d said it],’ ” Jenna said, "But you knew all along." “Oh, I knew all along,” Ferrell revealed before offering a light apology. “I’m sorry, Mr. President," he said. 03 of 18 Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump. Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Alec Baldwin first went viral for his impression of Donald Trump when he stepped into the role back in 2016. The 30 Rock actor went on to impersonate the former president several times following that Oct. 2, 2016, season 42 opener. "Lorne came to me and said, 'Do the Trump thing,' and we thought we were gonna do it for three episodes in the fall [thinking] there was no way he was gonna win," Baldwin told Jimmy Fallon while on his show in 2018. "And I remember laying in bed saying, 'Oh, no,'" the actor said of the moment he realized he'd have to do the impression for longer. Like Fey, Alec Baldwin also won an Emmy for his impersonation. 04 of 18 Amy Poehler and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton Amy Poehler and Kate McKinnon, Hillary Clinton. Dana Edelson/NBCUniversal via Getty (2); Cindy Ord/Getty Hillary Clinton' s position in the political landscape is so grand, she was played by two people on SNL. Amy Poehler first played the powerhouse politician in the 2008 to 2009 season, opposite Fey's Sarah Palin. She even had the opportunity to do her impression in front of the future secretary of state as the two opened a March 1, 2008, episode together . Poehler passed the baton to Kate McKinnon , who played Clinton during the 2014 to 2015 season. She too, got to do her impression in front of Clinton when they both visited the Ellen Show back in 2016. 05 of 18 Kate McKinnon as Jeff Sessions Kate McKinnon as Jeff Sessions. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty; Win McNamee/Getty During her 10-year tenure at Saturday Night Live, McKinnon also played former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And while the impersonation was well-received, the show gave the character an official goodbye during a Nov. 13, 2018, episode. 06 of 18 Kate McKinnon as Rudy Giuliani Kate McKinnon as Rudy Giuliani. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty; Roy Rochlin/Getty In 2020, McKinnon also stepped into Rudy Giuliani's shoes, a role which she told fellow SNL alum Seth Meyers oddly came naturally to her . 07 of 18 Kate McKinnon as Elizabeth Warren Kate McKinnon as Elizabeth Warren. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Another impression in Kate McKinnon's impressive Rolodex of characters was none other than Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries. It seems Warren was completely fine being parodied on the show, as she joined McKinnon and participated in the viral "Flip the Switch" challenge back in 2020. 08 of 18 Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer Melissa McCarthy, Sean Spicer. Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Melissa McCarthy had a hilarious turn playing Trump's former White House press secretary Sean Spicer. And while the Bridesmaids star's impression got the viewers going, Spicer had some notes at the time. While referring to a Feb. 5, 2017, episode in which McCarthy brought out silly props in order to satire her impression of a Spicer-led White House press conference, the subject stated he felt McCarthy "could dial back" a bit and that she "needs to slow down on the gum chewing" as there were "way too many pieces in there," CBS News reported . 09 of 18 Larry David as Bernie Sanders Larry David as Bernie Sanders. Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Jenny Anderson/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Larry David made his return to SNL just in time to play Bernie Sanders . The Curb Your Enthusiasm creator left his position as writer on the show back in 1984 and wouldn't come back again until 2016. He debuted his famed impression of the Vermont senator during that hosting stint. While fans always noted that their resemblance was uncanny, David found out he was actually related to the former presidential candidate during an episode of the PBS show Finding Your Roots . 10 of 18 Phil Hartman and Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton Phil Hartman and Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton. Gerry Goodstein/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty; Andrew Chin/Getty Phil Hartman played 42nd U.S. President Bill Clinton in the early '90s, between 1992 to 1994. One of his sketches, titled "President Bill Clinton at McDonald's'" remains one of the most popular from the show. But while fans love the skit, Hartman told David Letterman, "I found out the hard way that he really doesn’t like what I do,” Salon reported . It seems Darrell Hammond had better luck with Clinton as he recalled the former president tapping him to play a clone in a sketch at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. "I'm in the Oval Office in the full Clinton drag with the putty nose, the fake nose, the full thing," Hammond said while on the Howard Stern Show back in 2001. "He wanted me to play a clone in a sketch — with him — that he was doing for the Washington Correspondents' Dinner," he explained. He went on to reveal that Clinton actually sought his counsel when writing the funny bits of his speech. 11 of 18 Chloe Fineman as Nancy Pelosi Chloe Fineman as Nancy Pelosi. Will Heath/NBC via Getty; Jemal Countess/Getty Chloe Fineman joined Saturday Night Live in 2019 and immediately became a fan-favorite with impressions that ranged from Carole Baskin , Scarlett Johansson and of course, longtime House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . 12 of 18 Sarah Sherman and Alex Moffat as Chuck Schumer Sarah Sherman and Alex Moffat as Chuck Schumer. NBC; Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Anna Moneymaker/Getty Fineman's Pelosi also appeared alongside Sarah Sherman's Chuck Schumer . Before Sherman took over the role, Alex Moffat was tasked with playing the Senate majority leader from New York. At the time, McKinnon was his Nancy Pelosi. 13 of 18 Bowen Yang as George Santos Bowen Yang as George Santos. Will Heath/NBC via Getty; Anna Moneymaker/Getty Bowen Yang may have done a killer impression of George Santos , but he revealed stepping into the former U.S. congressman's shoes wasn't exactly an easy choice as he couldn't find any commonalities between them. "I didn't think [I was the guy to play him] because I was just not sure what his deal was, like any of us weren't sure," Yang told Seth Meyers . "I was like, 'Oh he has glasses and we both have a gross nasally voice, so maybe I'm the guy?' " Needless to say, the Fire Island star ultimately found a way in. 14 of 18 Fred Armisen and Jay Pharoah as Barack Obama Fred Armisen and Jay Pharoah as Barack Obama. Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty (2): Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Many people have attempted an Obama impression, but perhaps none have been quite as impactful as Fred Armisen and Jay Pharoah. Armisen began impersonating the 44th president of the United States back in season 33, before Jay Pharoah joined the cast and took over. The latter has done impressions of Obama ranging from ordering pizzas to dinner parties to addressing Ukraine. And it seems like the impressions have gone over well as he told Stephen Colbert Obama even tapped him to do the impersonation at a super secret private event. Asked if Obama like did it, Pharoah joked, "Well, he did. I am still here." 15 of 18 Jason Sudeikis and Dana Carvey as Joe Biden Jason Sudeikis and Dana Carvey as Joe Biden. Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty; Rosalind O'Connor/NBC via Getty; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Playing Obama's former right-hand man was Jason Sudeikis , who debuted his take back in 2007 and played the role till he left in 2013, though he continued to step in occasionally till 2019. For the season 50 cold open on Sept. 28, former SNL cast member Dana Carvey delivered his own Biden impression that immediately went viral. On his podcast, Fly on the Wall , Carvey revealed Lorne Michaels was "like a dog with a bone," and pressed Carvey to take on the role. Though he was hesitant at first, Carvey revealed the impression he landed on was very much a collaboration between himself and the SNL writers. 16 of 18 Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty; Alexander Tamargo/Getty As soon as Kamala Harris announced she was running for president, the internet cohesively urged Maya Rudolph to polish up her impression of the sitting VP. And though she appreciated the support, Harris told Variety , “It was also very bizarre, because I woke up to an article saying that I was confirmed to play her — and I hadn’t spoken to anyone!" she revealed. "This is so much bigger than me, and this is about something very important. I’m thrilled to be associated with it, and I’m also glad that I’ve played her and everyone’s cool with it. She likes it.” The Bridesmaids actress and former SNL alum first played Harris back in 2019 and has maintained the role since. 17 of 18 Martin Short and Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff Martin Short, Andy Samberg Doug Emhoff. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty (2); Kent Nishimura/Getty These impressions may still be relatively new, but the sheer commotion they've caused deserves to be noted. Former Saturday Night Live stars Martin Short and Andy Samberg tag-teamed to play second gentleman of the United States and husband to VP Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff . Samberg appeared as the "second gentlemensch" in the cold open for the season 50 premiere episode. Short later took over the reins in a segment simply titled, "Kamala" in which the couple hosts Ted Cruz (played by Aidy Bryant) and Joe Biden (played by Moffat) for Passover dinner. 18 of 18 Sarah Sherman as Matt Gaetz Sarah Sherman, Matt Gaetz. Will Heath/NBC via Getty; David Banks/UPI/Shutterstock Following President-elect Trump selecting Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as his pick for Attorney General , Sherman added another politician to her résumé in a cold open spoofing Trump and Biden's White House meeting . The sketch poked fun at Gaetz's ongoing investigation by the House Ethics Committee for sex trafficking. The Justice Department — which Trump has now tapped Gaetz to lead — previously investigated him over similar allegations, though they declined to bring charges.

She likes it.” The Bridesmaids actress and former SNL alum first played Harris back in 2019 and has maintained the role since. 17 of 18  Martin Short and Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff Martin Short and Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff Martin Short, Andy Samberg Doug Emhoff. Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty (2); Kent Nishimura/Getty Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty (2); Kent Nishimura/Getty These impressions may still be relatively new, but the sheer commotion they've caused deserves to be noted. Former Saturday Night Live stars Martin Short and Andy Samberg tag-teamed to play second gentleman of the United States and husband to VP Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff . Samberg appeared as the "second gentlemensch" in the cold open for the season 50 premiere episode. Short later took over the reins in a segment simply titled, "Kamala" in which the couple hosts Ted Cruz (played by Aidy Bryant) and Joe Biden (played by Moffat) for Passover dinner. 18 of 18  Sarah Sherman as Matt Gaetz Sarah Sherman as Matt Gaetz Sarah Sherman, Matt Gaetz. Will Heath/NBC via Getty; David Banks/UPI/Shutterstock Will Heath/NBC via Getty; David Banks/UPI/Shutterstock Following President-elect Trump selecting Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as his pick for Attorney General , Sherman added another politician to her résumé in a cold open spoofing Trump and Biden's White House meeting . The sketch poked fun at Gaetz's ongoing investigation by the House Ethics Committee for sex trafficking. The Justice Department — which Trump has now tapped Gaetz to lead — previously investigated him over similar allegations, though they declined to bring charges.

Entertainment TV Scripted TV Shows Zero Day Cast Reveals How AOC, the Clintons and Other Political Figures Influenced Their Characters (Exclusive) Robert De Niro, Lizzy Caplan, Matthew Modine and Joan Allen tell PEOPLE how they drew from a "compilation of leaders and people" for the Netflix political thriller By Stacy Lambe Published on February 20, 2025 02:22PM EST Comments Robert De Niro in 'Zero Day'. Photo: JOJO WHILDEN/Netflix A modern-day political thriller, Netflix's Zero Day tells the story of a beloved and former U.S. president whose reputation is questioned after he's tasked with leading a government-sanctioned investigation into a national cyber attack. Told over six episodes, the gripping limited series starring Angela Bassett , Connie Britton , Jesse Plemons and Robert De Niro meshes fact with fiction to tell this captivating and frightening life-like story about terrorism, truth, control and oversight. According to Netflix, it was, in fact, inspired by stories co-creator Eric Newman heard from journalists reporting on the country's relationship with what's real or fake. While the inciting incident for the series is not real, Newman tells PEOPLE that took inspiration from "this crisis of truth that has gone on, not just in America, but elsewhere." Although he says that "we never identify who's who in this story," the cast shares how they drew inspiration from various real-life political figures in their portrayals of their characters, with De Niro, who plays former President George Mullen, explaining that they drew from "compilation of leaders and people." Joan Allen in 'Zero Day'. Courtesy of Netflix Angela Bassett Reflects on Playing a Black Woman President in Zero Day : 'I Can’t Believe How Timely It Was' (Exclusive) As described by Netflix, Mullen is a popular one-term president who is pulled out of retirement by current President Evelyn Mitchell (Bassett, 66) to lead the Zero Day commission following the devastating cyber attack. Newman tells PEOPLE he "read quite a bit about Lyndon B. Johnson and some of the more recorded post presidencies" when writing the series, while De Niro, 81, says drew from real-life "interviews, speeches, press conferences where [these leaders] were put on the spot by certain questions." He says he watched to see how "they'd deal with them, how they sidestepped them." "That helped immensely for me," the actor continues, adding that he pulled from his experiences "just meeting people over the years." Bill and Hillary Clinton on Jan. 20, 2025. SHAWN THEW/POOL/AFP via Getty As for Mullen's dynamic with his wife, Sheila Mullen (Joan Allen), a former first lady and nominee to the federal bench, Bill and Hillary Clinton served as a reference point. Director Lesli Linka Glatter "talked to me about this as a partnership: It’s Bill and Hillary," Allen, 68, told Vanity Fair before explaining to PEOPLE that the two married politicians served as "a benchmark, or just kind of an indicator of this kind of relationship." "It's a partnership," she tells PEOPLE. "That was what was most important to Lesli and to me that the relationships between Sheila and George feel equal. That they are each other's best advisors and that they trust each other that much. And so that was kind of the standard that Lesli wanted to emphasize." Matthew Modine and Lizzy Caplan in 'Zero Day'. JOJO WHILDEN/Netflix Played by Lizzy Caplan, George and Sheila's daughter, Alexandra Mullen, is a congresswoman from New York who is having to navigate her own politics with her father's legacy in The White House. While "pretty deliberate in not making any of these characters easily traceable to one specific real-life person," Caplan, 42, says, she pulled from a "grab bag" of inspiration. "There are vague shades of A.O.C. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] , but there's also shades of Chelsea Clinton and the Bush daughters ," she explains. Matthew Modine, meanwhile, says he "wouldn't wanna [call out] any of them by name," but in order to portray the antagonistic and outspoken House Speaker Richard Dreyer the actor, 65, treated it like "I was a witch making a brew." He continues, saying, "I threw a little bit of this one, a little bit of that one, stirred it up and then put the mask on." Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Nov. 19, 2024. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Angela Bassett Says the Door Is 'Open' For Connie Britton to Return to 9-1-1 (Exclusive) Dan Stevens plays one of the more divisive characters, Evan Green, the calculating host of a popular political TV show who is often critical of George's time in The White House as well as the investigation. The 42-year-old actor tells PEOPLE that he was inspired by "so many of these podcasters, vodcasters. You know, guys who preach from their studios to their particular choirs." "They exist in all countries now and on all sides of the political spectrum. There were a couple of probably recognizable ones in there," he continues, teasing potential one-to-one comparisons. "But I looked far and wide at all the different kinds of tropes of these guys and tried to create something that was a little bit original but still just as annoying. Rounding out the all-star cast for Zero Day is Plemons, 36, as George's former aide and fixer, Roger Carlson; Plemons' former Friday Night Lights costar, Britton, 57, as George's former chief of staff, Valerie Whitesell; Bill Camp as CIA Director Jeremy Lasch; Gaby Hoffmann as the controversial Silicon Valley billionaire Monica Kidder; and Clark Gregg as political provocateur Robert Lyndon — all characters navigating their own agendas in what Newman says is a show about the fight for truth over untruth "based on how we wish it was more than or ever has been."

Matthew Modine, meanwhile, says he "wouldn't wanna [call out] any of them by name," but in order to portray the antagonistic and outspoken House Speaker Richard Dreyer the actor, 65, treated it like "I was a witch making a brew." He continues, saying, "I threw a little bit of this one, a little bit of that one, stirred it up and then put the mask on."

Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Angela Bassett Says the Door Is 'Open' For Connie Britton to Return to 9-1-1 (Exclusive) Dan Stevens plays one of the more divisive characters, Evan Green, the calculating host of a popular political TV show who is often critical of George's time in The White House as well as the investigation. The 42-year-old actor tells PEOPLE that he was inspired by "so many of these podcasters, vodcasters. You know, guys who preach from their studios to their particular choirs." "They exist in all countries now and on all sides of the political spectrum. There were a couple of probably recognizable ones in there," he continues, teasing potential one-to-one comparisons. "But I looked far and wide at all the different kinds of tropes of these guys and tried to create something that was a little bit original but still just as annoying. Rounding out the all-star cast for Zero Day is Plemons, 36, as George's former aide and fixer, Roger Carlson; Plemons' former Friday Night Lights costar, Britton, 57, as George's former chief of staff, Valerie Whitesell; Bill Camp as CIA Director Jeremy Lasch; Gaby Hoffmann as the controversial Silicon Valley billionaire Monica Kidder; and Clark Gregg as political provocateur Robert Lyndon — all characters navigating their own agendas in what Newman says is a show about the fight for truth over untruth "based on how we wish it was more than or ever has been."

She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on June 21, 2023 06:20AM EDT From left: Monica Lewinsky and then-President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Photo: Getty The scandals that shadowed Bill Clinton 's administration, which he insisted were fueled by partisan anger, seemed to reach their denouement when it was revealed he had an affair with a White House intern less than half his age. As details of Clinton's behavior played out in televised hearings and at his impeachment trial , Americans got a front-row seat to the secrets and private moments of the most powerful man in the world. While it seemed like something of an overnight sensation from the moment it broke in the Drudge Report , what became known as the Clinton-Lewinsky affair had plenty of lead-up. Here's a chronological look at the allegations, controversies and investigations related to Bill, which were chronicled in the 2021 FX limited series Impeachment: American Crime Story . Monica Lewinsky on Whether Bill Clinton Owes Her an Apology: 'I Don't Need It' Anymore 1978: The Clintons make a land purchase in Arkansas Bill and Hillary Clinton , along with their friends Jim and Susan McDougal, bought 230 acres of riverfront land for $203,000 with the intention of selling it as vacation home lots, The New York Times reported . The deal was ultimately a bust, and Jim bought a savings and loan association and renamed it Madison Guaranty. He ultimately defrauded both Madison Guaranty and another small-business investment firm, called Capital Management Services, to the tune of $3 million. According to The New York Times , the scheme cost the federal government around $73 million and 15 people were charged for their role in the scandal. ( Jim died in prison in 1998.) The Clintons, however, were never charged and no wrongdoing was ever proven. They have adamantly maintained they had no involvement. 1992: Allegations about Whitewater dealings begin to surface Questions about the Whitewater dealings surfaced during Clinton's 1992 bid for the presidency, with the Justice Department eventually opening an investigation into the matter and an illegal $300,000 loan provided to the McDougals. Monica Lewinsky Marks 25th Anniversary of Bill Clinton Affair: 'One's Taste in Partners Gets Better' July 20, 1993: Vince Foster dies by suicide The deputy White House counsel, Vince Foster, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Fort Marcy Park off Virginia's George Washington Parkway. Foster reportedly suffered from depression , seeking treatment one day before his death, yet conspiracy theories soon began swarming (and persisted decades later). A series of investigations — one of which, according to a 1994 Washington Post report, involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents and approximately 125 witnesses — confirmed Foster's death was a suicide. One month prior to his death, Foster had filed three years of delinquent Whitewater corporate tax returns and was said to be plagued by the evolving ethics investigations into the Clintons. January 1994: Special counsel Robert Fiske Jr. launches Whitewater probe Attorney General Janet Reno appointed New York lawyer Robert Fiske Jr. as special counsel to investigate the Clintons' involvement in the Whitewater land purchase. January 1994: Paula Jones comes forward with harassment claims against Bill Clinton Shortly after the release of a story in the conservative magazine American Spectator , in which Paula Jones was mentioned by first name only, she came forward to allege that President Clinton had harassed her while he was serving as governor of Arkansas. Two days before the expiration of a three-year statute of limitations, she filed a sexual harassment suit, seeking $750,000 in damages. Jones' claims served as the impetus for broadening the investigation into Clinton's pre-presidency financial dealings. Later, Washington Post reported that a state trooper confirmed parts of Jones’ account but alleged that she volunteered her phone number to Clinton and asked to be his girlfriend. The accounts came two years after Clinton had publicly admitted to " marital wrongdoing " in the past. August 1994: Kenneth Starr takes over Whitewater probe Kenneth Starr, who served as solicitor general under former President George H. W. Bush , took over Fiske's probe into the Whitewater dealings. Starr's legal team included future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , who worked for Starr in the Bush-era Justice Department. Linda Tripp. Dave Tracy/Getty Fall 1997: Linda Tripp starts recording conversations with Monica Lewinsky Linda Tripp , a career civil servant moved from the White House to the Pentagon, began taping conversations she had with Monica Lewinsky , a former White House intern who had just begun working in the Pentagon with her. In the tapes, Lewinsky detailed the affair she had been having with President Clinton since November 1995. October 1997: Linda Tripp plays the tapes for a reporter and a book agent In a meeting with Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, book agent Lucianne Goldberg and her son, Jonah Goldberg, Tripp played a tape of one of her conversations with Lewinsky. Newsweek ultimately opted not to proceed with its story on the then-unsubstantiated affair. Dec. 17, 1997: Monica Lewinsky is subpoenaed Lewinsky — who left her job at the Pentagon around this same time — was subpoenaed by lawyers for Jones' suit against the president. Dec. 28, 1997: Monica Lewinsky visits the White House Lewinsky made her final visit to the White House to privately discuss the subpoena with President Clinton. According to a 1998 CNN report , Lewinsky later told prosecutors that the president encouraged her to be "evasive" to investigators during the meeting. Monica Lewinsky. Roberto Borea/AP/Shutterstock Jan. 7, 1998: Monica Lewinsky files an affidavit denying affair with President Clinton In an affidavit filed as part of Jones' case, Lewinsky denied ever having had a sexual relationship with President Clinton. Monica Lewinsky Looks Back at 'Incredibly Painful' Scrutiny Endured by the Women in Clinton's Scandals Jan. 12, 1998: Linda Tripp contacts Kenneth Starr Tripp contacted Starr's office to discuss the Lewinsky tapes, which detailed both the affair and indicated that Clinton and his friend Vernon Jordan — who had earlier helped Lewinsky find work in New York after leaving Washington, D.C. — may have told the former intern to lie under oath. Jan. 16, 1998: The probe expands, Linda Tripp meets with Monica Lewinsky at hotel After Tripp reached out, Starr got permission from a panel of federal judges to expand his probe, allowing him to formally investigate the possibility of perjury and obstruction of justice by Clinton in the Jones case. Around the same time, Tripp, wearing a wire, met Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton. FBI agents interceded and questioned Lewinsky in a hotel room. Jan. 17, 1998: Bill Clinton gives sworn deposition In a sworn deposition as part of the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky — a lie that would later fuel his impeachment. Monica Lewinsky (center) in May 1998. Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Jan. 19, 1998: The Druge Report mentions Monica Lewinsky Lewinsky's name surfaced publicly for the first time, via the Drudge Report, a nascent conservative news and gossip website. A post on the site mentioned that Newsweek had allegedly delayed publishing a piece on the affair between Clinton and Lewinsky. Jan. 26, 1998: Bill Clinton addresses the nation, denies the affair In a now-notorious public statement delivered on national television, President Clinton denied the claims of his affair with Lewinsky, saying, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky." The Bond and Bad Blood Between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp: Secret Tapes, Codenames and 'That' Blue Dress July 28, 1998: Monica Lewinsky turns over the blue dress In exchange for grand jury testimony, Lewinsky received transactional immunity. She turned over a semen-stained blue dress to Starr's investigators. Aug. 17, 1998: Bill Clinton testifies before grand jury and addresses the nation Clinton became the first sitting president to testify before the Office of Independent Counsel as the subject of a grand jury investigation. Following his testimony, he addressed the nation live via television, admitting to an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky but saying he never asked anyone to "lie, hide or destroy evidence or to take any unlawful action." Sept. 9, 1998: The Starr Report is referred to Congress Starr delivered his referral — known as the Starr Report — to Congress, leading to Clinton's impeachment in the House of Representatives on two counts: perjury and obstruction of justice. November 1998: Bill Clinton settles with Paula Jones Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000, according to a CNN report , but did not give her an apology or admit guilt, in exchange for her agreement to drop the appeal. Dec. 19, 1998: President Clinton impeached Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and charged with perjury and obstruction of justice. Feb. 12, 1999: Bill Clinton acquitted by the Senate President Clinton's five-week impeachment trial ended in February 1999, and the Senate acquitted him on the two counts. Neither he nor Hillary was ever criminally accused for their role in the Whitewater land deal that first spurred Starr and his investigators. Three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence to tie the Clintons to the criminal conduct of others involved in the transaction.

"In the next day, I'm going to Bob Dole's funeral. He ran against me for president and we fought about a lot of things," Clinton told PEOPLE in an interview previewing his new MasterClass series on leadership that launches Dec. 16. "But I respected him. I respected the life he lived, the sacrifices he's made. I gave him the Medal of Freedom after the election because I think we have to keep reaching out.

Photo: Andy Stenning - WPA Pool/Getty; Andreas Rentz/Getty; Eugene Gologursky/Getty Prince Harry 's upcoming trip to New York City will include a speaking engagement for the Clinton Foundation alongside actor Matt Damon and Chef José Andrés . On Sept. 5, the nonpartisan organization founded by former President Bill Clinton announced that the Duke of Sussex, 39, will participate in the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting. The event is set to run from Sept. 23 to Sept. 24 in New York City with a focus on "What's Working" to address "climate resilience, global health equity, gun violence, the protection of journalists, humanitarian crises and other pressing global challenges." Damon, who is co-founder of Water.org and WaterEquity, and Andrés, the celebrity chef and founder of World Central Kitchen, were also unveiled as participants, alongside Sophia Bush , Ginger Zee and many more. "This year’s @ClintonGlobal is going to be a great meeting. Let’s get to work!" Clinton wrote on X , reposting a report from the Associated Press , which said that Prince Harry, Damon and Andrés were "set to speak" there. Will Prince Harry and Prince William Be in New York City at the Same Time Next Month? The former president, 78, told the AP that the 2024 GCI would "double down" on efforts. "We started CGI because we wanted to have a meeting where people didn’t just talk about big problems, but where we could roll up our sleeves and get something done," Clinton said in a statement to the outlet. "It’s more important than ever to be optimistic and realize we all have the ability to make a difference." Further information shared to the Clinton Foundation website said that the upcoming meeting is timed to align with the U.N. General Assembly, connecting to a previous detail about Prince Harry's upcoming trip to N.Y.C. Last week, a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex announced that Prince Harry will visit New York City during U.N. General Assembly High-level Week and Climate Week. Climate Week kicks off on Sept. 22 and ends Sept. 29, and High-level Week runs from from Sept. 23 to Sept. 27. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

"He will participate in engagements with African Parks, The HALO Trust, The Diana Award and Travalyst." King Charles ' son will also "be furthering the work of The Archewell Foundation, the nonprofit organization he co-founded with his wife Meghan , The Duchess of Sussex," the spokesperson added. Though Prince William 's Earthshot Prize will be holding its annual Innovation Summit in New York City around the same time — Sept. 24, to be exact — the brothers are not expected to cross paths in Manhattan, as William is not expected to make the trip across the pond for this year's event.

Will Prince Harry and Prince William Be in New York City at the Same Time Next Month? The former president, 78, told the AP that the 2024 GCI would "double down" on efforts. "We started CGI because we wanted to have a meeting where people didn’t just talk about big problems, but where we could roll up our sleeves and get something done," Clinton said in a statement to the outlet. "It’s more important than ever to be optimistic and realize we all have the ability to make a difference." Further information shared to the Clinton Foundation website said that the upcoming meeting is timed to align with the U.N. General Assembly, connecting to a previous detail about Prince Harry's upcoming trip to N.Y.C. Last week, a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex announced that Prince Harry will visit New York City during U.N. General Assembly High-level Week and Climate Week. Climate Week kicks off on Sept. 22 and ends Sept. 29, and High-level Week runs from from Sept. 23 to Sept. 27. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Prince Harry will be in N.Y.C. to "advance a number of his patronages and philanthropic initiatives," the spokesperson said. "He will participate in engagements with African Parks, The HALO Trust, The Diana Award and Travalyst." King Charles ' son will also "be furthering the work of The Archewell Foundation, the nonprofit organization he co-founded with his wife Meghan , The Duchess of Sussex," the spokesperson added. Though Prince William 's Earthshot Prize will be holding its annual Innovation Summit in New York City around the same time — Sept. 24, to be exact — the brothers are not expected to cross paths in Manhattan, as William is not expected to make the trip across the pond for this year's event.

People Editorial Guidelines and Diane Herbst Diane Herbst Diane Herbst is a reporter at PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines Published on March 28, 2022 05:31PM EDT Photo: Monica Schipper/Getty; "Indefatigable." That's how Melanne Verveer, now the executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, is remembering Madeleine Albright — the first female U.S. secretary of state and a "trailblazer" diplomat, whom Verveer called a close friend for more than two decades and who died last week at 84. Verveer first met Albright in 1993 when she was chief of staff to then-First Lady Hillary Clinton and Albright had just been picked as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by President Bill Clinton . Though the two worked together throughout the years, Verveer remembers a specific moment when their professional relationship grew tighter: at the 1995 Fourth World Conference where Albright was the head of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. "We worked, really, day and night, very closely," Verveer tells PEOPLE. "There was a lot of work to do to plan for the U.S. role in the conference and so, from that moment on, it became a very, very close relationship and one that continued because the conference took place in September." Months after the conference, President Clinton was re-elected and nominated Albright as the first-ever female secretary of state. "She played a major role in the State Department in ways that the public doesn't know so much," Verveer says. Among Albright's accomplishments, says her friend, was her central role in "advancing progress for women and girls as a foreign policy issue," and she was the one to set up "the first office on women's issues in the state department." Albright was also the first to champion "women's rights into the U.S. human rights issue," says Verveer, who notes that Albright "in many ways, started all of the kinds of things that later became de rigueur." As for how Verveer would describe the former secretary of state, she spares no compliments: "She was determined. She wasn't nervous as some people might be of using her power for good. She had the greatest sense of humor. She was delightful to be with — absolutely delightful." * For more on Madeleine Albright's life and legacy, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up next week's issue, on newsstands Friday. Madeleine Albright. Wally McNamee/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images Albright's family announced on Wednesday that she had died from cancer earlier that day. She was remembered as a "tireless champion of democracy and human rights" and a "loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend." Albright first immigrated to the United States at 11 years old, from Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1948. She spent the remainder of her childhood in Denver before going on to study at Wellesley College, where she graduated in 1959. Her career in national politics traces back to being recruited to the White House under President Jimmy Carter following years of postgraduate study. She counseled several prominent Democratic politicians on foreign policy. Madeleine Albright's Daughter Alice Shares Her Late Mother's Life Story: 'Best Mom Ever' For Verveer, news of Albright's death was a "sudden shock," she says. The pair last spoke in January after Albright backed out from appearing at an event Verveer was organizing at Georgetown University, where Albright was also a professor. "She would call me and say, 'Well, I don't think I should do this.' And then she'd say, 'I think it's okay if just somebody else does it, or I don't know that I should participate in another aspect,' " Verveer says. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty "It was clear that she wasn't feeling well," says Verveer, even though she didn't know the extent of what was happening. She says the biggest indication for her that something was wrong came later in January, when Albright gave notice to the university that she wouldn't be teaching her class that semester. "That class meant everything in the world to her. She loved the students, she loved the exchange, she loved the material they covered, she never missed a class," Verveer recalls, "that was a sign that she was clearly in decline and knew that she wasn't up to it." Verveer also mentions she didn't know the former secretary had been diagnosed with cancer before her death and only knew that Albright had a gastrointestinal problem. Even then, Albright "didn't want to talk about her health," Verveer says. Instead, Albright would say she trusted her doctors to "figure out what the problem" and was always quick to change the subject. Hillary Clinton Remembers 'Irrepressible' Madeleine Albright's 'Vital Voice' in Op-Ed After Diplomat's Death "I think few people knew she was ill, but just the sudden shock of her passing," Verveer says. "I think she wants to be remembered as someone who tried to make a difference and wants us to continue to do that," Verveer tells PEOPLE. "Even President Clinton said that she wanted to get on with the conversation from talking about her to talking about the world that our children and grandchildren would inherit." "She's of a mind that we all have a lot of work to do," her friend says, "and I don't think she'd want a lot of fuss made over her — but would want us to get back to work."

Celebrity Celebrity Belief & Identity Celebrity Social Issues Bill Clinton Hopes Hillary's Emotional Reading of Victory Speech 'Will Make People a Little Less Cynical' The former president says his wife's loss in the 2016 presidential election was "one of the most profound mistakes we ever made" as a country By Aaron Parsley Aaron Parsley Aaron Parsley is a former senior news editor at PEOPLE. He left PEOPLE in 2023. People Editorial Guidelines and Sandra Sobieraj Westfall Sandra Sobieraj Westfall Sandra Sobieraj Westfall is a former national political correspondent, digital writer and editor at large at PEOPLE. She left PEOPLE in 2023. People Editorial Guidelines Published on December 17, 2021 11:16AM EST Earl Gibson III/WireImage. Bill Clinton believes "one of the most profound mistakes we ever made" as a country was not electing his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , president of the United States in 2016. In an interview with PEOPLE ahead of the release of President Bill Clinton Teaches Inclusive Leadership , which launched Thursday on MasterClass , the former president said Sec. Clinton was "the most qualified person to run for office in my lifetime, including me." In her own recent course on the power of resilience for MasterClass , Ms. Clinton read portions of a victory speech she hoped to give in 2016 but never did because of her defeat at the hands of Donald Trump . Looking back, the former president said Sec. Clinton's qualifications worked against her in the race because her opponent and his supporters were "busy discrediting all institutions." "Being well-qualified is a bad thing, having done things in the jobs you had before, including the magnificent job she did as a Senator for New York, it didn't count for anything, because the whole system was messed up," President Clinton told PEOPLE. Bill Clinton Shares Secrets of North Korea Talks in New MasterClass, Reacts to FX 'Impeachment' Series He went on to say that fixation on "the email thing" during the campaign was "ridiculous," referring to persistent implications, allegations and investigations of a private email server Sec. Clinton used during her time at the State Department. Clinton apologized for mishandling emails and cooperated with an investigation that ended without charges . "I never thought there was anything to it and sure enough, there wasn't, and even a conservative Republican U.S. attorney appointed by Bill Barr under President Trump said there wasn't," Clinton said. Seth Wenig/AP He also told the story of an encounter he called "the most disappointing thing that happened to me personally when I was campaigning for Hillary in 2016." While taking selfies with his wife's supporters, a young man approached and made accusations against the Clintons. The president said the claims were unfair and explained why but found it hard to discuss matters of substance with the man who approached him at the campaign event. Huma Abedin Shares Guilt Over Hillary Clinton Losing Presidency: 'Going to Take It to My Grave' "When you form these fixed views that are divorced from facts, it didn't work," he said, using it as an example of how his qualified wife's historic candidacy could be reduced to a single issue like her emails. Justin Sullivan/Getty "It's just easier if you can turn a three-dimensional human being into a two-dimensional cartoon," he said. "But it's not what life's about. Life's about filling out figures, not shrinking them." Hillary Clinton Reads Her Deeply Personal Planned 2016 Victory Speech: 'I've Never Shared This With Anybody' By reading her deeply personal speech, Clinton said his wife is coloring in the lines of her life, her contributions and who she is as a person. "I hope and I think she hopes that it will make people a little less cynical about who people are and what they can do," he said. It's a topic the former president touches on in his own MasterClass course on leadership, which includes a lesson he said he learned from Nelson Mandela, who went from prison for anti-apartheid activism to becoming South Africa's first Black president, on finding opportunities to work with those who oppose you for the sake of a better future. "The grief he took from his own supporters for putting his adversaries in his cabinet," was worth it, Clinton said, "because he was thinking about the future." "He was saying, 'We just got to vote for the first time in 300 years, and there's nothing we can run on our own. We have to reach out to these people and give them a chance to be a part of our common future, because we need their help to run the schools, the banks, the military, you name it, every institution in society,' " Clinton said. "And he understood that."

Lifestyle Health Celebrity Health Bill Clinton Discharged from Hospital After Being Treated for Flu: ‘His Family Are Deeply Grateful’ “He sends his warmest wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season to all," Clinton's deputy chief of staff said in a statement By Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman is a digital writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. She has also worked in broadcast television as a reporter for Hawaii-based news station KHON2 News. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on December 25, 2024 01:17PM EST 2 Comments Former President Bill Clinton marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund at the Treasury Department in Washington on November 21, 2024. Photo: Sipa via AP Bill Clinton has been discharged from the hospital, one day after developing a fever . The former U.S. president, 78, was diagnosed with the flu and treated for his symptoms at a Washington D.C.-area hospital before being discharged on Tuesday, Dec. 24, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña shared on X (formerly known as Twitter). “... His family are deeply grateful for the exceptional care provided by the team at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and are touched by the kind messages and well wishes he received,” Ureña continued. “He sends his warmest wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season to all.” The day before, Ureña shared on X that Clinton was admitted for “testing and observation” but remained in “good spirits.” Bill Clinton’s Memoir Citizen Centers Our Common Humanity: ‘Live in the Present, for the Future’ (Exclusive) A source also told NBC News the current situation is "not urgent." The insider continued, "The former president will be fine. He developed a fever and wanted to be checked out. He is awake and alert." Clinton will be home for Christmas, though it is unclear how this would affect his annual holiday tradition of visiting his daughter Chelsea ’s family, including her three kids — Charlotte, 8, Aidan, 6, and Jasper, 3 — with wife Hilary Clinton . "Hillary says I've always been our family's Christmas elf," he said in 2021.

"We always go down on Christmas Eve, spend the night and have Christmas Day with them," he continued. "And I think it's the right thing to do, intergenerationally. And then we normally go to the train display at the Bronx Zoo. It's great." He also shared in an interview on Live with Kelly and Mark that he has embraced the nickname “pop-pop,” which has been passed down from generation to generation in their family. Bill Clinton Says His 'Small' Family's Decades-Long Thanksgiving Tradition Involves About 40 People (Exclusive) "It's what Chelsea called Hillary's dad. And you know, we have a great time together. It's a good deal," he told Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos in November. "Would you say that's the number one most powerful position in the household? Being pop-pop of the family?" Ripa asked. "Depends on what day it is. Some days it's the least most powerful," he joked. "But it has the longest cool list." This isn’t the first time the 42nd president has been hospitalized. He previously had a quadruple bypass heart surgery in 2004 and had another procedure in which two stents were added into his heart in 2010, according to CNN . He was also hospitalized for a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream in 2021, per the outlet.

She was previously an Associate Editor for the Health vertical for six years, and prior to joining PEOPLE worked at Health Magazine. When not covering professional athletes, Julie spends her time as a (very) amateur athlete, training for marathons, long bike trips and hikes. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 1, 2022 03:55PM EDT Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Photo: Brooks Kraft/Getty Chelsea Clinton has always appreciated her body and cared for her health — and that positive thinking is something she credits to mom Hillary Clinton . The former First Daughter, 42, talked about her body image during an appearance on The View Friday after the hosts brought up Jenna Bush Hager 's recent quotes about appreciating that her mom, former First Lady Laura Bush, never discussed weight . Chelsea said that weight was a topic in the Clinton household, but it was never directed towards her. "My mom always had a really strong emphasis on health. So I wasn't allowed to eat sugar cereal, except on the weekends, and my parents made sure I really understood what a vegetable was. And I do remember my mom going on Weight Watchers when I was a kid, and yet even though it was called Weight Watchers, she always talked about it as being good for her health," the global health advocate said. Jenna Bush Hager Praises Mom Laura Bush for Not Discussing Weight in Their Home The emphasis on eating well for her health, and not to lose weight, was important, Chelsea said, especially when she was in the public eye while her dad, former President Bill Clinton , ran for office. Chelsea and Bill Clinton at a reception at the White House in 1996. getty "I think that did help protect me when I was 12, 13, and my dad was running for office and there were all sorts of largely older white men commenting on my looks, on my weight, on my appearance," she said. "I was like, 'Well that's about them, that's not about me.' " Chelsea said that both Hillary and Bill instilled a strong sense of self in her that helped during that time. "I give my mom — and my dad, but mainly my mom — a lot of credit for the sense of self that I had and the focus on health and how I felt about myself and not what other people were saying to me, or whatever messages that were coming to me from either other people or Cosmo ." RELATED VIDEO: Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on What It Means to Be a 'Gutsy' Woman View co-host Joy Behar said that the now-deceased commentator Rush Limbaugh was particularly "nasty" towards Chelsea and her parents, but Chelsea pointed out that he wasn't the only one. "Rush Limbaugh was nasty, the most infamous but not the only. And yet, I never internalized that, I think because, again, thankfully, of everything my parents, my grandparents, my teachers, my Sunday school teachers — the messages the adults in my life were sending and instilling in me helped really prepare me," she said. "They were saying nasty stuff about my parents but it was weird! I was 12! And that there are like these older men pontificating about how a 12-year-old looks is weird, at best, and really disgusting and cruel and creepy." Hillary and Bill have continued to support Chelsea in her pursuits, including at the New York City Marathon last November . Along with Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky and their three children, Charlotte, Aidan and Jasper, Bill and Hillary cheered her on along the 26.2-mile course .

And I'm like, 'I am. I'm going to make it. You have to come.' And she was like, 'Okay, we'll be there,' " Chelsea said after the race. "The fact that my parents were able to be there, that my kids were at two different points in the rally," helped her finish in a time of 3:59:09.

Photo: Grant Baldwin/Getty The Democratic National Convention starts on Monday, Aug. 19, in Chicago, where nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are expected to accept the party's baton from President Joe Biden . Harris' journey to becoming the Democratic nominee began less than one month ago, on July 21, when Biden dropped out of the presidential race . The same day, he gave his "full support and endorsement" for Harris to become the nominee. She secured enough delegate support to become the presumptive Democratic nominee the following day, while also collecting more than $80 million in donations during her first 24 hours as a 2024 presidential candidate. Following weeks of speculation over who Harris, 59, would choose as her running mate , she announced Minnesota Gov. Walz as her VP pick on Tuesday, Aug. 6, and took him onstage with her hours later. NBC reports that Harris and Walz, 60, made a "Road to Chicago" bus tour heading to the DNC, with Gwen Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff joining them on the road for a few final stops before their big week in the Windy City.

He left PEOPLE in 2022. People Editorial Guidelines Published on December 28, 2021 11:09PM EST Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Barack Obama is mourning the loss of former Nevada senator Harry Reid, who died on Tuesday at the age of 82. The former president, 60, tweeted a heartfelt tribute to his friend and political ally — who was instrumental in helping him pass various key pieces of legislation during his administration — and included an emotional letter he wrote Reid in his final days. "When Harry Reid was nearing the end, his wife Landra asked some of us to share letters that she could read to him. In lieu of a statement, here's what I wrote to my friend," Obama said in the tweet that included a photo of the pair along with the letter. Harry Reid, Former Nevada Senator and Lieutenant Governor, Dead at 82 "Here's what I want you to know," Obama wrote to Reid in the letter. "You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect. I wouldn't have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn't have gotten most of what I got done without your skill and determination." "Most of all, you've been a good friend," he continued. "As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other – a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team." "Enjoy your family, and know that you are loved by a lot of people, including me," he concluded. "The world is better cause of what you've done. Not bad for a skinny, poor kid from [Reid's birthplace] Searchlight."

He had previously declared himself cancer-free in the summer of 2020 following an experimental treatment. During his long and decorated political career, Reid served as U.S. Senator for Nevada for three decades, from 1987 until 2017. Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Charlene Lead Tributes to Desmond Tutu: 'a Moral Compass' During that time, he was elected Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015 and helped pass legislation including Obama's Affordable Care Act as well as the Dodd-Frank Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which were both meant to aid in the country's recovery after the 2008 recession. Other notable politicians to pay tribute to Reid on Tuesday included current Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, who called him "tough-as-nails strong" in a tweeted statement on Tuesday. "Harry Reid was one of the most amazing individuals I've ever met," Schumer also said in his statement. "He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends."

Bush’s in 2018, bringing a rare moment of civility to politics as all of the remaining U.S. presidents came together By Luke Chinman Luke Chinman Luke Chinman is an editorial intern at PEOPLE. He joined PEOPLE in 2024. His work has previously appeared in The Berkshire Eagle and Luxe Interiors + Design . People Editorial Guidelines Updated on January 9, 2025 01:03PM EST 336 Comments The five living U.S. presidents — Joe Biden , Donald Trump , Barack Obama , George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — reunited to honor the life and legacy of Jimmy Carter . On Thursday, Jan. 9, a date dedicated by Biden as a national day of mourning, the former and current heads of state gathered at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., to pay their respects to the 39th president at his funeral service. See Every Time Former U.S. Presidents Have Gotten Together President Obama, who arrived without his wife, Michelle, walked over to greet the former presidents and vice presidents before the service, as each stood up to say hello. But Trump, who was seated beside his wife, Melania, did not stand for Obama. Moments later, when Obama took his seat directly beside Trump, the tides shifted as Trump immediately began chatting with his predecessor, with whom he has regularly butted heads with as recently as the 2024 election. All five living U.S. presidents attend Jimmy Carter's state funeral on Jan. 9, 2025. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Barack Obama Makes Viral Hand Gesture While Slamming Donald Trump's 'Weird' Obsession with 'Crowd Sizes' The extended conversation marked a rare moment of civility between political foes, one most commonly found at a solemn occasion. Jimmy Carter’s Funeral Recap: Inside a Powerful Day of Mourning for the 39th U.S. President ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Thursday marks the final of six days of events , during which Carter lay in repose at The Carter Presidential Center and stopped in front of his childhood home and farm in Plains, Ga. Carter was a single-term president, holding the office from 1977 to 1981, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his global humanitarian efforts in the decades after his presidency. He died at the age of 100 on Dec. 29 after spending nearly two years in hospice care , becoming the longest-living U.S. president and the president with the lengthiest post-White House life.

But Trump, who was seated beside his wife, Melania, did not stand for Obama. Moments later, when Obama took his seat directly beside Trump, the tides shifted as Trump immediately began chatting with his predecessor, with whom he has regularly butted heads with as recently as the 2024 election.

Citizen: My Life After the White House , out Nov. 19 from Alfred A. Knopf, is the former president's first-person account of his years after he became a private citizen on Jan. 20, 2001, after nearly 30 years in politics and eight years as president.

'Citizen: My Life After the White House' by Bill Clinton. Knopf The book includes Clinton's account of significant events such as 9/11 and the Iraq War, the Haiti earthquake, the Great Recession, the January 6 insurrection and issues facing our country and society, including "the unprecedented challenges brought on by a global pandemic, ongoing income inequality, a steadily warming planet and authoritarian forces dedicated to weakening democracy," according to a press release shared with PEOPLE.

The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now ! In advance of its publication, read an exclusive excerpt from Citizen detailing his humorous "rules for politics" and listen to Clinton read it below. Listen to Bill Clinton read from his new book 'Citizen' For years, going back to my days in Arkansas, I kept handy a list of “Clinton’s Rules of Politics” that I used to explain, enlighten and lighten up political conversations: Never tell anyone to go to hell unless you can make them go (Sam Rayburn told LBJ that). Never drink in public — you might act like yourself. Whenever you hear, "It’s nothing personal,” brace yourself. When someone can shift the heat from himself to you, prepare to be barbecued. Everyone is for change in general but often against it in particular — it depends on whose ox is being gored. When people say, “It’s not a money problem,” they’re always talking about someone else’s problem. If you see a turtle on a fence post, it didn’t get there by accident. When you start to have a good time, you’re supposed to be somewhere else. You’re always most vulnerable when you feel invulnerable or when you’re angry and exhausted. Take criticism seriously, but not personally (one I got from Hillary and well explained by Don Miguel Ruiz in The Four Agreements ). If you want to bring your feelings to work, get in another line of work. Don’t give up on people — if you dig long enough, there’s almost always still a person down there somewhere. The 2016 election forced me to go to a baker’s dozen with a new rule: “If you’re ever in the room with someone who says ... but you’re going to win anyway,’ smile, thank them for their time and get out of that room as fast as you can.” They may want you to win, but they don’t want to speak up for you for fear of criticism or punishment. “Anyway” is the tell word. When you hear it, get ready to move. Excerpted from CITIZEN: My Life After the White House by Bill Clinton, published by Alfred A.

Celebrity Celebrity Belief & Identity Celebrity Social Issues Bill Clinton Urges Americans with Opposing Views on Gun Control to 'Just Talk to Each Other Again' "Don't be afraid to talk to people, and don't talk down to them," Bill Clinton said of Americans with differing viewpoints on gun control meeting in the middle By Nicholas Rice Nicholas Rice Nicholas Rice is a Senior Editor for PEOPLE Magazine. He began working with the brand as an Editorial Intern in early 2020, before later transitioning to staff positions. Nicholas writes and edits anywhere between 7 to 9 stories per day on average for PEOPLE, spanning across each vertical the brand covers. People Editorial Guidelines Published on June 16, 2022 11:12AM EDT Bill Clinton is sharing his thoughts on how Americans with differing viewpoints on gun control can move forward together. The former president, 75, appeared as a guest on The Late Late Show with James Corden on Wednesday evening, where he spoke candidly about the gun problem plaguing the country. After being asked by host James Corden why it is "so hard for Americans to come to an agreement" on gun control, Clinton explained, "The gun culture itself is sufficiently strong, that there are more people who are against doing something than for it, if it's voting issue." "... A lot of gun owners are inherently suspicious of government, easy to spook and don't want to take a chance," he continued, before continuing to detail how people with opposing views can meet in the middle. "Don't be afraid to talk to people, and don't talk down to them. ... Assume that they got good sense and they're afraid of losing what they got," Clinton said. "And instead of telling them that they're dumb [because] they don't agree with you, ask for their help." "We need to just talk to each other again," Clinton added to Corden, 43.

President Joe Biden Says He Has No Plans to Issue Executive Order on Gun Control on Kimmel Clinton's chat comes as negotiations are talking place on Capitol Hill to pass gun control measures following a recent series of mass shootings. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden discussed the topic during his first in-studio late-night appearance as president while on Jimmy Kimmel Live! . "You were here in September 2019, and one of the things we talked about at length was gun violence," Kimmel, 54, told Biden, 79. "You said we needed to do something about gun violence, particularly when it comes to schools. Halfway through this year already, and there have been what, 27 shootings at schools? Why haven't we done anything about this?" In response, Biden said, "I think a lot of it is intimidation by the NRA. This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a MAGA party. It's a very different Republican Party." As Kimmel countered about the state of the GOP, he said, "It seems like the party has moved hard-right, but the people maybe haven't moved hard-right. Because people overwhelmingly believe we should have serious background checks" — to which the audience applauded. Pointing to the assault weapons ban he sponsored in 1994, Biden said that violence and gun crime dropped in the decade it was in effect — but that things changed for the worse immediately after the Bush administration didn't reauthorize it. "You could own assault weapons again. And guess what? Crime went up significantly," the president said. "There is a direct correlation between the kinds of weapons that can be had [and crime]."

"You said we needed to do something about gun violence, particularly when it comes to schools. Halfway through this year already, and there have been what, 27 shootings at schools? Why haven't we done anything about this?" In response, Biden said, "I think a lot of it is intimidation by the NRA. This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a MAGA party. It's a very different Republican Party." As Kimmel countered about the state of the GOP, he said, "It seems like the party has moved hard-right, but the people maybe haven't moved hard-right. Because people overwhelmingly believe we should have serious background checks" — to which the audience applauded. Pointing to the assault weapons ban he sponsored in 1994, Biden said that violence and gun crime dropped in the decade it was in effect — but that things changed for the worse immediately after the Bush administration didn't reauthorize it. "You could own assault weapons again. And guess what? Crime went up significantly," the president said. "There is a direct correlation between the kinds of weapons that can be had [and crime]."

Celebrity Celebrity Relationships Celebrity Friendships Monica Lewinsky Marks 25th Anniversary of Bill Clinton Affair: 'One's Taste in Partners Gets Better' Monica Lewinsky detailed what she has "observed and learned in the quarter century since" her affair with former President Bill Clinton in a self-penned piece for Vanity Fair By Nicholas Rice Nicholas Rice Nicholas Rice is a Senior Editor for PEOPLE Magazine. He began working with the brand as an Editorial Intern in early 2020, before later transitioning to staff positions. Nicholas writes and edits anywhere between 7 to 9 stories per day on average for PEOPLE, spanning across each vertical the brand covers. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 20, 2023 10:47AM EST Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Monica Lewinsky is reflecting on the 25th anniversary of her affair with former President Bill Clinton going public. In a self-penned piece for Vanity Fair , the activist and writer, 49, detailed what she has " observed and learned in the quarter century since" she was a White House intern. "One thing everyone has in common is that we have all made mistakes. It's inevitable. Get comfortable with the Art of the Mistake," wrote Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton, 76, made headlines on Jan. 21, 1998, and ultimately led to his impeachment. "You cannot run away from your narrative," she added in another section. Lewinsky then spoke about choosing friends "carefully," writing, "Twenty-five years ago I had one of the world's worst friends: Linda 'Judas, hold my beer' Tripp." Noting that she has "since let go of the resentment and bitterness that surrounded" Tripp's "betrayal," Lewinsky continued, "It's not lost on me how very fortunate I am to have been able to trust new people." In one other note, Lewinsky playfully teased her past relationship with Clinton, saying, "As the years pass, one's taste in partners gets better. (Wink.)," and she concluded her thoughts by writing, "Lastly, I don't know how to say this other than to be direct and insufferably corny: You can survive the unimaginable."

Astrid Stawiarz/Getty; Slaven Vlasic/Getty Monica Lewinsky Looks Back at 'Incredibly Painful' Scrutiny Endured by the Women in Clinton's Scandals Back in 2021, Lewinsky chatted with PEOPLE about her era-defining political scandal in the mid-'90s and how every aspect of her life was publicly examined and critiqued — including her physical appearance. "We didn't even have words like 'fat shaming' or 'slut shaming' then," Lewinsky told PEOPLE at the time. "It was incredibly painful." Want to get the biggest stories from PEOPLE every weekday?

"I still don't like having my photo taken professionally," she continued. "Twenty-plus years on, there's still a mental tape that holds some of those traumatic experiences of hearing people say awful things, seeing cartoons of myself and this idea that the only reason an actual relationship [with Clinton] could have been possible was if I were more attractive." Added Lewinsky: "I already had self-esteem issues, and being the object of ridicule didn't help." RELATED VIDEO: Monica Lewinsky on Whether Bill Clinton Owes Her an Apology: 'I Don't Need It' Anymore Looking back, Lewinsky also explained to PEOPLE of the Clinton scandal, "For me, at 22 there was this combination of the awe of being at the White House, the awe of the presidency and the awe of this man who had an amazing energy and charisma was paying attention to me." "I was enamored with him, like many others," she continued. "He had a charisma to him — and it was a lethal charm, and I was intoxicated." Lewinsky said she also no longer needs an apology from Clinton, stating, "If I had been asked five years ago, there would have been a part of me that needed something — that still wanted something. Not any kind of relationship, but a sense of closure or maybe understanding. And I feel incredibly grateful not to need any of that." What Lewinsky said she did hope for, however, is a continued discussion, especially about the dynamics between men with power and those without it. "As we all came to see, it wasn't just about losing a job but about the power to be believed, the power to be inoculated from the press, the power to have others smear someone's reputation in all the ways that work, the power to understand consequences having held many important jobs, where this was my first out of college," she said.

Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty; Andrew Chin/Getty President Joe Biden and former President Bill Clinton were among the big political names to write tributes to those on this year's TIME100 , a list of the most influential people of the year. Biden's tribute came in honor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , who he called "a leader worthy of [the Ukrainian peoples'] bravery and resilience." "The nations of the free world, inspired by the example of President Zelensky, are more united, more determined, and more purposeful than at any point in recent memory," Biden, 79, wrote. "With the support of the U.S. and our allies and partners, he has left his mark on history and proved to the world that Ukraine will long endure and its people will ultimately realize the democratic future they have long desired." Former First Lady Michelle Obama wrote her own tribute — to Oprah Winfrey , who she described as having a talent for connecting with just about anyone. "Whether she's talking to pop stars, Presidents, schoolgirls, scholars—or she's asking you about your life over a glass of wine in the living room—Oprah has always had that uncanny ability to open us up, to hear beyond our words, and to uncover a higher truth, to be vulnerable with us in a way that allows us to be vulnerable back," the former first lady wrote. Mrs. Obama continued: "That's her secret. But what I love most about Oprah is that she has never been content to keep it for herself." Zelenskyy Opens Up About Family, the War and Secretly Venturing Out of His Compound amid the Fighting Clinton, 75, also wrote a tribute on the list — one about Biden, who he lauded for the U.S. response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. "On the global stage, President Biden has unified our democratic allies across Europe and around the world to isolate Russia and provide military and humanitarian assistance to the brave people of Ukraine, while restoring U.S. leadership on key issues including climate change, democracy, and human rights," Clinton wrote. "We still face stern tasks, including taming inflation without causing a recession, and combatting violent crime." Clinton continued: "The usual sound bites and answers that dominate the news won't help. But a get-the-job-done leader who cares more about the people than the polls, more about winning the future than rewriting history, will. That's who Joe Biden is. And why I'm glad he's on the job."

Occasionally, brands may send us products for editorial consideration, but our thoughts and opinions are entirely our own. Our recommendations are purely editorial and we are transparent when we’ve received a sample. We are fully committed to offering the highest quality content for humans, by humans — our team of writers and editors rigorously research and fact-check every article we put out. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT. Our Process We love online shopping (perhaps more than most — after all, we made it our job!), but we recognize that the saturated marketplace can make it hard to find the right product. That's why we sift through the mountains of goods to source only the stuff that’s actually worth your money (and help you identify what isn’t). We rely on our own comprehensive market research, as well as the guidance of trusted expert sources, to create our product and service recommendations. And oftentimes, we’ll test items either in one of our three testing labs or independently at home to give them a thorough, real-life trial run. Finally, we never consider an article “finished.” Brands are constantly changing their inventory which can then render a previous recommendation obsolete. And trust us — we understand how frustrating it can be to find the perfect product only to click on it and see that it's been discontinued. As such, we utilize a process by which our “best-of” articles are routinely checked for accuracy and updated with new launches when applicable. PEOPLE/Jessica Juliao How We Test Our testing process is not only rigorous, it’s super fun, too. We have three labs across the country (New York, Des Moines, and Birmingham) where we put products through the wringer from set-up to take-down. Need a nonstick pan ? We had our in-house recipe developers cook omelets and rice in them to truly vet how well the food slides out. Or maybe you’re in the market for a vacuum cleaner, which we tested against Cheerios, popcorn kernels, and hair. Our testers take turns applying our intricate methodology to each product while our photographers capture each step of the testing process. (You can read more about our PEOPLE Tested seal of approval here .) We also test products at home, where we’re able to give them a “real world” trial in a more personal setting (for example, dress shoes are better off tested during your weekly commute than walking around a lab). Home testing also allows us to take products for a long-term spin and measure how well they perform over time (does that popular coffee machine still deliver a hot, strong cup after months of use? We’ll let you know!). Similar to our lab tests, we create replicable methodologies for our home tests and ask our testers to score products on several factors designed to replicate how people actually use them. We also ask them to document their testing via photos and videos to give readers an even better glimpse into how well the product performed. Jennifer Lopez/INSTAGRAM If we’re recommending services that can’t easily be tested by a writer or editor, such as internet and TV bundles, we heavily research the topic area and analyze a wide range of data points in order to compile our “best-of” lists. All companies we consider for a specific category are evaluated using the same set of criteria, which is agreed upon by our editorial and research teams and various industry experts. The criteria varies depending on the subject matter, but typically includes factors like price range, nationwide availability, and customer service response time. News & Deals Our shopping editors are in the know about buzzy new products and the best online sales from brands both big and small. We quickly alert you when Meghan Markle’s sneakers see discounts and when we find the exact skincare JoJo Fletcher used on her wedding day. And during popular sale events like Prime Day and Black Friday, we work around the clock to gather only the best, most exciting deals out there. We’re also constantly tapped into the latest trends to ensure that your living room, backyard, closet, and vanity (and everything else) are always upgraded with the best new things. Chances are if you’ve seen it on Instagram or TikTok, we’ve already started researching it. How We Make Money We receive an affiliate commission on most, but not all, of the products and services we recommend. We only recommend trusted retailers with a proven track record for service and dependability. Safety While we do our best to thoroughly vet and continually update the content we review or recommend, some products may be subject to recalls or revised use recommendations. As a result, we urge you to monitor any official announcements from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that may be related to products you purchase. You might also consider registering your purchases with the manufacturer so you can get alerted if a recall is issued. Contact Us If you have questions, comments, or opinions you’d like to share with our team of editors, please feel free to email us at peoplecommerce@dotdashmdp.com.

Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty It's not every day you see more than one president in the same place — and it's especially rare to see three. So when Presidents Joe Biden , Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined forces at New York's Radio City Music Hall on Thursday evening for a conversation with late-night host Stephen Colbert , it's no surprise that big things happened. "An Evening with the Presidents" — which was hosted by Mindy Kaling and featured musical guests Lizzo , Queen Latifah , Ben Platt , Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele — set a national fundraising record even before the program began, bringing in an estimated $25 million for the Biden Victory Fund, which aims to help President Biden win reelection in November. Tickets for the event ranged from $225 on the low end to as high as $500,000 with all the VIP perks. To get a photo with all three commanders-in-chief at the event, guests were looking at a $100,000 price tag.

She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets. People Editorial Guidelines Published on March 29, 2024 01:09PM EDT Former US President Barack Obama (L) and US President Joe Biden. Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty President Barack Obama says that the reasons he selected Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 are the same reasons he thinks Biden deserves to be reelected in 2024: his moral conviction and ability to find common ground even amid complex political issues. Obama, 62, attended a Democratic fundraiser on Thursday evening with Biden and Bill Clinton to discuss the state of democracy and the upcoming election. During a Q&A between the presidents, Obama touched on Biden's positive traits — a topic that arose after protesters in the audience interjected with shouts of disapproval about how the White House has handled the humanitarian crisis in Gaza . The disruption prompted the presidents to each speak on the Israel-Gaza war , but while Obama was responding, the protestors cut him off. "No, no listen. You can't just talk and not listen," Obama told the audience. "That's what the other side does. And it is possible for us to understand that it is possible to have moral clarity and have deeply held beliefs, but still recognize that the world is complicated and it is hard to solve these problems." Biden Calls for Two-State Solution, More Aid in Gaza: ‘Saving Innocent Lives Has to Be a Priority’ "The reason why I originally selected Joe Biden to be my vice president, the reason that I think he was one of the best vice presidents we've ever had, and the reason why I think he has been an outstanding president is because he has moral conviction and clarity," Obama continued. "But he's also willing to acknowledge that the world is complicated, and that he's willing to listen to all sides in this debate and every other debate and try to see if we can find common ground. That's the kind of president I want." Joe Biden Says European Leaders Feared for Strength of Democracies After Jan. 6: ‘Everybody Looks to Us’ Stephen Colbert moderates a discussion between Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on March 28, 2024. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty As protesters were escorted out of the event, Clinton took a turn addressing their concerns, saying, "I believe that this is one of the most important reasons to elect President Biden. And I'm going to tell you why. Because he genuinely cares about preserving the existence of Israel, which Hamas doesn't. And he genuinely cares about giving the Palestinians a decent state, self-governance and the support they need for self-determination." "Look, the world we live in is hard because you have to keep two apparently conflicting ideas in your head at the same time," Clinton continued, adding that Biden has publicly voiced his support for a two-state solution , which centers on the establishment of two independent states: Israel and Palestine (currently, the Palestinian territories of Gaza and West Bank are occupied by Israel.) Biden Calls for Two-State Solution, More Aid in Gaza: ‘Saving Innocent Lives Has to Be a Priority’ "You should trust him to work for it," Clinton said. "To work to ease the suffering of the totally innocent Palestinian citizens, and not to allow Israel's security to be lost over a bitter difference between the legitimacy of the Palestinians to statehood, which we agree with, all three of us."

Thursday night's Q&A covered several topics — including the economy, border security and the peaceful transfer of power — each of which led to the presidents emphasizing the difference between Biden and Donald Trump 's leadership.

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024. Her work has previously appeared in Good Housekeeping, Woman's Day, Prevention, The New York Times, and others. People Editorial Guidelines Published on November 28, 2024 05:45AM EST Comments Former President Bill Clinton at a New York City event on Feb. 29, 2020. Photo: Noam Galai/Getty Images Bill and Hillary Clinton have a decades-long Thanksgiving tradition at their New York home. While speaking with PEOPLE about his new memoir, Citizen: My Life After the White House , the former president of the United States, 78, shared how he and his "pretty small" family celebrate the November holiday. Bill said that his daughter, Chelsea , 44, whom he shares with Hillary, 77, started a tradition when she traveled overseas to attend University of Oxford in England that involves them celebrating with a larger group than usual. "She invited us to come have lunch with her and 24 of her friends," Bill recalled. Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving in 1997. Frank Johnston/TWP/Getty Images Sharing the day with chosen family in addition to the core Clinton trio left a mark on the former first couple, who have sought to extend their Thanksgiving dinner table each year since. "Every Thanksgiving for more than 20 years now, we have gathered," Bill said, explaining that their typical Thanksgiving Day gathering now includes "older friends of Hillary's and mine who are alone, and all of Chelsea's friends who are either single, alone or from another country that doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving." "We have between 40 and 45 people in a normal year in our little house," he added. "So it's pretty hard, but we do it." See U.S. Presidents with the Turkeys They've 'Pardoned' Bill noted that their holiday festivities don't end with a large dinner, either. "The ones that wanna stay, stay the night, and Chelsea and [her husband] Marc play cards with 'em, and then we go walk in the hills near our house the next day. And that's it," he said. "It's great, we love it." President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton outside their Chappaqua, N.Y., house in January 2000. Chris Hondros The former president's new book was released on Nov. 19 and offers his first-person account of the years that followed his two-term presidency from 1993 to 2001. "Just days after leaving the White House, the call came to aid victims of a devastating earthquake in India, and Clinton hit the ground running," the synopsis teases. "Over the next two decades, he would create an enduring legacy of public service and advocacy work, from Indonesia to Louisiana, Northern Ireland to South Africa, and in the process reimagine philanthropy and redefine the impact a former president could have on the world." Bill Clinton Says He Didn't Even Try to Bring Family Backstage at Taylor Swift Eras Tour: 'I Probably Couldn't Have' Additionally, the book covers the former president's thoughts on major events that have unfolded since his time in office, including 9/11 , the Iraq War, the Haiti earthquake, the Great Recession, the January 6 insurrection, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and his wife Hillary’s time as senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate. Speaking with PEOPLE about his personal life principle , he said, "You need to be thinking about what you're gonna do today that will help tomorrow. I just decided that's the way I would think all the time: What can I do today? How can I move the law forward on something I care about?" Citizen: My Life After the White House is now available wherever books are sold.

ESPN analyst and former tennis star John McEnroe said of the unexpected duo during a broadcast of the event By Giovana Gelhoren Giovana Gelhoren Giovana Gelhoren is a former digital news writer at PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 30, 2022 12:02PM EDT Photo: Gotham/GC Images Serena Williams ' last US Open is making for some memorable moments — both on and off the court. During the tennis legend's first game in the tournament on Monday, former president Bill Clinton , 76, was in attendance with an unexpected guest: sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer . Throughout the game, the Ask Dr. Ruth star, 94, and the politician talked plenty, often smiling, laughing and nodding at one another. At one point, Dr. Ruth appeared to give Clinton a playful slap on the face. When the camera first panned to the duo, ESPN analyst and former tennis star John McEnroe asked, "Who knows what they're talking about?" Serena Williams Wins First Round Match at US Open After Shaky Start: 'I Want to Do My Best' Trying to understand their conversation, co-analyst and former tennis player Chris Evert said, "Look at these two, they're really involved in some sort of … She's giving him advice," co-analyst Chris Evert said, The New York Post reported. "She just gave him advice. Yep, 'You shouldn't be doing that.'" "Why is his face getting redder?" McEnroe joked. R. Diamond/WireImage Though little is known about their friendship, pictures of the two date back to 1991, two years before his first term as president. According to The Middletown Press , the sex therapist even encouraged Clinton, who was a governor at the time, to run for the presidency. In photos, their height difference is always a stand-out: Dr. Ruth is a mere 4′7" while the former president stands at 6′2". Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Celebrate Bill Clinton's 76th Birthday on Long Island With 'Happy Memories' Though the longtime friends appeared on screen for just a few seconds, internet users went wild about what they couldn't possibly be talking about. "Bill Clinton and Dr Ruth sitting together at the #USOpen is a million times more entertaining than tennis," a user tweeted . "The guest situation at the #USOpen is absolutely UNHINGED," tweeted another, hinting to another odd pairing in the audience: boxer Mike Tyson sitting next to tennis player Martina Navratilova with a dog on her lap. A representative for Clinton did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. Chrystyna Czajkowski/AP Photo Clinton and Dr. Ruth were not the only celebrities in attendance. Queen Latifah, Spike Lee, Bella Hadid and other A-listers were also in the stands cheering for Williams. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The six-time US Open winner, who last month announced she was "evolving away from tennis" dazzled a cheering sold out US Open crowd behind her every stroke as she defeated Montenegro's Danka Kovinic, 6-3, 6-3. She will next face Anett Kontaveit of Estonia, the No. 2 seed, in the second round.

People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 21, 2024 09:49PM EDT 3 Comments Bill Clinton at the 2024 DNC. Photo: CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Former President Bill Clinton had a memorable moment at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, Aug. 21, while speaking about Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz 's vision for the future — and Donald Trump 's age. Clinton, who turned 78 on Aug. 19, joked about his own age during his remarks before adding: "The only personal vanity that I want to assert is that I'm still younger than Donald Trump," Trump, also 78, was born in June. Elsewhere in his remarks, Clinton alluded to Trump's apparent obsession with crowd sizes, adding to a joke made by Barack Obama on Tuesday night. "So, we've got to ask ourselves the question: Do you want to build a strong economy from the bottom, up, and the middle, out — or do you want to spend the next four years talking about crowd size?" Clinton asked. Obama, Clinton and Biden Reunite for Most Lucrative Political Fundraiser in U.S. History: Photos The 2024 election, Clinton said, was a choice between Harris — whom he said "will ease our fears" — and "the other guy, who's proved, even more than the first go-around, that he's about me, myself and I." Clinton also urged the audience to listen to Trump's words when he speaks, saying, "The next time you hear him, don't count the lies. Count the I's — his vendettas, his vengeance, his complaints, his conspiracies ... he's like a tenor trying to get his lungs open by singing, 'me, me, me, me, me.' " "When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with you, you, you, you, you," he added. Barack Obama Praises Joe Biden at the DNC amid Reports of Tension Between Them: 'We Became Brothers' Bill and Hillary Clinton attend a Japanese state dinner at the White House on April 10, 2024. DREW ANGERER/AFP/Getty Clinton has been helping the Democratic Party rake in cash throughout the 2024 campaign cycle, previously joining Presidents Obama and Joe Biden for a star-studded New York City fundraiser in March, when Biden was still on track to get re-nominated.

When Biden abandoned his reelection bid and backed Harris to take his place on the Democratic ticket, the Clintons quickly followed suit , offering an endorsement of Harris that same afternoon. "We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term," the former first couple said in a statement. "He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution." They continued: "Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it."

She graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor in Journalism. Before joining the team, she worked as an Editor at FanSided and provided work in the celebrity and lifestyle space for brands that include Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, EW, and more. People Editorial Guidelines Published on December 2, 2022 10:38PM EST Photo: Paul Morigi/Getty; Kevin Mazur/WireImage Bill Clinton is mourning the death of Christine McVie . The former president, 76, paid tribute to the late Fleetwood Mac singer by reflecting on his connection to the band's 1977 single "Don't Stop," which McVie wrote . " 'Don't Stop' was my '92 campaign theme song – it perfectly captured the mood of a nation eager for better days," he wrote in a Twitter post shortly after her death at age 79 on Wednesday. In the video accompanying the post, McVie performed the song alongside fellow band member Lindsey Buckingham at his inaugural ball in 1993. At the time, "Don't Stop" had become a staple for Clinton's conventions and rallies and is attributed as one of the appeals to Clinton's baby boomer demographic. Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler, Diane Warren and More Pay Tribute to the Late Christine McVie "I'm grateful to Christine & Fleetwood Mac for entrusting us with such a meaningful song. I will miss her," added Clinton in the post. The former president referenced the song at the end of his speech at the 2000 Democratic National Convention, proclaiming, "Remember, keep putting people first. Keep building those bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow." Fleetwood Mac said there were "no words" to describe the sadness of her death in a statement posted on their social media pages on Wednesday. RELATED VIDEO: Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie Dead at 79 Following 'Short Illness' "She was truly one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure," the statement read. "She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life. We were so lucky to have a life with her. Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed." McVie's family announced her death on social media , writing that she died at the hospital "following a short illness," surrounded by her family.

He joined the publication on the crime beat. People Editorial Guidelines and Liz McNeil Liz McNeil Liz McNeil is an Editor at Large at PEOPLE, where she's worked for over 30 years. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on June 5, 2023 09:26AM EDT Bill Clinton and Dr. Ruth. Photo: Gotham/GC Images Dr. Ruth Westheimer , the Holocaust survivor turned Israeli soldier turned quick-witted sex therapist, has a remarkable life story that has inspired millions around the nation — but as she turns 95 , one potentially pivotal conversation still stands out in her mind: the time, she tells PEOPLE, that she helped convince then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton to set his sights on the White House. Westheimer says it was thanks to her and "some other smart people" that Clinton ultimately decided to run for president in 1992. "I reminded him [at a recent event] that many years ago in Arkansas I saw him — I saw this handsome, tall man. I said, 'You should run for president. I will vote for you,' and the rest is history, as you know." In response, a spokesperson for the Office of President Bill Clinton tells PEOPLE, “Dr. Ruth has given a lot of good advice over the years, but maybe none better than telling a young Arkansas Governor he should run for President!” According to Westheimer, Clinton is always quick to credit her for the enthusiasm she showed him before he ran. RELATED: The Story Behind Bill Clinton and Dr. Ruth's Decades-Long Friendship: 'He's Always Been Impressed by Her' At the event where Westheimer saw Clinton in May — nearly a year after the two sparked internet buzz for sitting together at Serena Williams' US Open game — the duo spent a moment catching up. Westheimer tells PEOPLE she won't divulge the details of their chat, except that it wasn't about the weather — "that's too boring." "He kissed me on my head," she says, "and Hillary was there and Hillary smiled, and I had a great time chatting with him." RELATED: Bill Clinton and Dr. Ruth's Friendship Through the Years (Photos) Bill Clinton talks to Dr. Ruth Westheimer shortly after announcing his 1992 presidential campaign. Chrystyna Czajkowski/AP Photo Westheimer's longtime friendship with the 42nd president of the United States is well-documented , dating back to the 1980s. "Dr. Ruth traveled to Arkansas in the '80s to visit her daughter, Miriam," a source close to the Clintons explained to PEOPLE in 2022, adding that Bill got wind of Ruth's visit and requested a meeting with the Westheimers at the governor's office. "Dr. Ruth's show was on TV then, and needless to say, she was a massive hit with the staff," the source said. "She and President Clinton have been friends ever since."

Through the decades, the pair have been photographed together on a number of occasions, often bearing wide grins or doing silly poses that accentuate their comical height difference (Ruth proudly stands at 4 feet, 7 inches, with the former president towering overhead at 6 feet, 2 inches). Together they have attended charity events, the Grammys, a White House state dinner honoring Moroccan royalty, and — as of last year — a US Open match where a retiring tennis legend pulled off a win.

Kennedy , sent out to her politician friends for Valentine's Day over the years.

XO Bearhugs, Ethel." While delivering the final eulogy for Ethel at her memorial on Wednesday, Biden brought up that valentine as a cherished possession of his. "I don’t know how many of you got that damn valentine, but I tell you what, it meant a lot to me," he said. "I’ve received a lot of honors in my life, but that might be the best one I’ve ever received."
