New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 42 Chris Banks East New York, Spring Creek-Starrett City, Brownsville, East Flatbush, Remsen Village, Canarsie Biography Chris Banks represents the 42nd Council District which includes the communities of East New York, Starrett City, Brownsville, Canarsie, Remsen Village, and East Flatbush.  He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York. The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community. Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on. Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration. His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York. Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan. Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Access the Legislative API On November 16, 2017, the Council released the NYC Legistar API, allowing the public to directly access our legislative data. What is an API? The Council shares and archives all of our legislative information, including proposed and passed legislation, hearings, and monthly Stated meetings, on our Legislative Research Center, known as Legistar. The New York City Council Legistar system was built by Granicus using their Legistar Legislative Management Suite. The Legistar Web API for New York City is now available for read access by the public. In Council 2.0, the Council’s technology and engagement roadmap, we outlined different ways to increase access and transparency to our legislative information. Making the NYC Legistar API open to the public will allow individuals to create tools and platforms that pull directly from this data source, ensuring increased accuracy and reliability.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

--- 3rd Level Page: http://webapi.legistar.com/Home/Examples ---
Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API.

The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

Introduction This bill would codify New York City’s (“City” or “NYC”) cooling center program. The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.

Introduction This bill would require the City of New York to establish a fund providing loans, grants, in-kind services, in-kind materials or some combination, to make small business storefronts accessible to people with disabilities. Small businesses of 100 employees or fewer and three locations or fewer would be eligible for the fund. The fund would award up to $250,000 in total value per storefront, and loans issued through the program would have an interest rate of no more than three percent. The City would be responsible for establishing a timeline of 90 days or less for the review of applications, issuing an approval or rejection of the application, and a disbursement of the fund, as applicable. Small business tenants or property owners who would bear the cost of the construction project would receive the fund award, but both parties must agree to receive it, unless a prior agreement states otherwise. As a condition of receiving the fund, the City may require that the storefront’s tenant be given a reduction in rent that equals a total of half the value of money, services and materials received through the fund.

No. 762-B Establishing exemptions for third-party food delivery services from the limits on fees charged by such services on food service establishments. Introduction The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.

Brooks-Powers Amended and Coupled on GO Flash flood preparedness outreach and evacuation guidance. Introduction This bill would require New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) to disseminate localized emergency preparedness materials in locations that are prone to flash floods, in order to increase public awareness as to the appropriate responses by members of the public to flash flood risks and to increase registration for an emergency notification system. Such efforts would involve outreach conduct in-person and via mass mailings, and target locations selected with consideration of: (i) a history of flash flood events; and (iii) the prevalence of subgrade dwellings. Additionally, NYCEM would be required to develop guidance for facilitating safe evacuation before flash flood emergencies. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS, STATE & FEDERAL LEGISLATION Not available Int 0694-2024 A Sandy Nurse Amended and Coupled on GO Long-term citywide bathroom strategy and to make other technical changes. Introduction This bill would create a permanent, long-term strategic planning process for establishing and maintaining a citywide public bathroom network. This would be led by a Deputy Mayor in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, and any other agency with relevant experience and expertise. The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use.

Disclaimer and limitation as to use of IV Media Networks Services IV Media Networks Services are operated on an "as is," "as available" basis. To the full extent permitted by law, IV Media and its affiliates disclaim any and all representations and warranties with respect to the IV Media Networks Services, whether express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, warranties of title, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or use. Without limiting the foregoing, IV Media and its affiliates do not represent or warrant that the IV Media Networks Services will operate without interruption or error. Under no circumstances shall IV Media or its affiliates, or any of their employees, directors, officers, agents, vendors or suppliers, be liable for any direct or indirect losses or damages arising out of or in connection with the use of or inability to use the IV Media Networks Services, including, but not limited to, general, special, consequential, incidental, exemplary or any other type of damages. Your use of the IV Media Networks Services is at your sole risk. Applicable law, including the law in new jersey, may not allow the limitation of liability set forth above, so this limitation of liability may not apply to you. Arbitration Agreement Instead of suing in court, you and IV Media each agree to arbitrate disputes on a bilateral (individual) basis. You and IV Media agree that any dispute, controversy or claim between you and IV Media which cannot be settled through the customer service department refunding your payments in full (if applicable) and which arises out of or relates to (i) these Terms of Use; (ii) any aspect of your relationship with IV Media and IV Media Networks Services, irrespective of whether the dispute, controversy or claim arose after the termination of the relationship between you and IV Media and/or IV Media Networks Services (collectively, "Claims"), shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes Claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. You understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to assert or defend your rights; provided, however, either you or IV Media may bring an individual lawsuit in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply. The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with only those exceptions provided under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq. ("FAA"), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Class Action Waiver. IV Media and you each agree that each and both Parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury and may bring Claims against the other party only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative or collective proceeding. All arbitrations under this Arbitration Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide or collective) basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide or collective relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Use specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver"). If a court decides that the limitations of this paragraph are invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration. Informal Dispute Resolution Requirement. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought. All notices to IV Media shall be sent to the following address: IV Media Legal Department, 6740 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344. All notices sent by IV Media to you will be sent to the email and/or mailing address provided in your IV Media Account. Upon receipt of such notice, the other Party shall have a sixty (60) day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim and/or providing all the relief requested in the notice, and/or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the Parties. After the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, you or IV Media may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both you and IV Media agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party. Right to Opt Out of this Arbitration Agreement. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the first 30 days after the earliest of the first time you (a) make a purchase from IV Media; or (b) sign up for any program or service provided by IV Media. You may also opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after we provide notice of a material change to this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration of any Claim under this Agreement shall be referred to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures, including information on how to initiate arbitration, are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its website (www.adr.org). Unless you and ShopHQ agree otherwise, including to conduct arbitration by telephone or videoconference, the arbitration of any Claim shall be conducted in the State in which you reside, and ShopHQ will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; and (2) not seek attorney's fees in the event ShopHQ prevails. Each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. Governing Law and Other Terms . This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the FAA and other applicable federal law. To the extent state law applies to any aspect of this Arbitration Agreement, or to Claims that are covered by the Arbitration Agreement, the law of the State of Minnesota, will govern. IV Media will provide notice of any material changes to this Arbitration Agreement. Except as set forth above regarding the Class Action Waiver provision, if a court decides that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such determination will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement. Only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this Agreement, including whether any dispute falls within its scope. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action/representative waiver above must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver.

Arbitration Agreement Instead of suing in court, you and IV Media each agree to arbitrate disputes on a bilateral (individual) basis. You and IV Media agree that any dispute, controversy or claim between you and IV Media which cannot be settled through the customer service department refunding your payments in full (if applicable) and which arises out of or relates to (i) these Terms of Use; (ii) any aspect of your relationship with IV Media and IV Media Networks Services, irrespective of whether the dispute, controversy or claim arose after the termination of the relationship between you and IV Media and/or IV Media Networks Services (collectively, "Claims"), shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes Claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. You understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to assert or defend your rights; provided, however, either you or IV Media may bring an individual lawsuit in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply. The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with only those exceptions provided under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq. ("FAA"), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Class Action Waiver. IV Media and you each agree that each and both Parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury and may bring Claims against the other party only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative or collective proceeding. All arbitrations under this Arbitration Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide or collective) basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide or collective relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Use specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver"). If a court decides that the limitations of this paragraph are invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration. Informal Dispute Resolution Requirement. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought. All notices to IV Media shall be sent to the following address: IV Media Legal Department, 6740 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344. All notices sent by IV Media to you will be sent to the email and/or mailing address provided in your IV Media Account. Upon receipt of such notice, the other Party shall have a sixty (60) day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim and/or providing all the relief requested in the notice, and/or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the Parties. After the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, you or IV Media may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both you and IV Media agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party. Right to Opt Out of this Arbitration Agreement. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the first 30 days after the earliest of the first time you (a) make a purchase from IV Media; or (b) sign up for any program or service provided by IV Media. You may also opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after we provide notice of a material change to this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration of any Claim under this Agreement shall be referred to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures, including information on how to initiate arbitration, are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its website (www.adr.org). Unless you and ShopHQ agree otherwise, including to conduct arbitration by telephone or videoconference, the arbitration of any Claim shall be conducted in the State in which you reside, and ShopHQ will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; and (2) not seek attorney's fees in the event ShopHQ prevails. Each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. Governing Law and Other Terms . This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the FAA and other applicable federal law. To the extent state law applies to any aspect of this Arbitration Agreement, or to Claims that are covered by the Arbitration Agreement, the law of the State of Minnesota, will govern. IV Media will provide notice of any material changes to this Arbitration Agreement. Except as set forth above regarding the Class Action Waiver provision, if a court decides that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such determination will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement. Only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this Agreement, including whether any dispute falls within its scope. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action/representative waiver above must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver. Instead of suing in court, you and IV Media each agree to arbitrate disputes on a bilateral (individual) basis.

That makes it very important to us. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128bit encryption technology to protect your online information. How do we make sure information is secure? We use the latest encryption technology (Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL) to secure your personal information. The information you provide when you place an order is encrypted (or coded) using a secure server for maximum security. This coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your information as it moves through our ordering system. Certain browsers will not allow communication through secure servers. If this is the case, you won't be able to place an order online. If you have any problems placing an order online please print your shopping page and place your order by phone by calling Christopher & Banks'  Customer Service at 1-800-890-9601. To check the security of your computer, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Netscape, or the lower right-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Internet Explorer. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the encryption technology is active and the server is secure.

Neither we nor the third party service providers who manage our website are responsible for these linked websites, their content or for the actions of the providers of such sites. We recommend that you review the privacy and security policies and terms of use for any websites you use. Do I have to turn the security feature on when I want to shop? The security features are automatic, and always on. You don't have to do anything but shop. Clicking "Checkout" on any page is all it takes to get started in our secure checkout process. How do I know if I'm connected when I start ordering? Once you've clicked the "Continue Checkout" button, your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm that it's communicating with our web-site. Once a positive ID is made, your order will continue securely. Are all the pages on your web-site secure? Most of the pages on our website provide information about Christopher & Banks and our products. We make this information available freely and there's no reason for these pages to be "secure." The pages that we make secure are the ones on which you actually make the purchase, such as when managing your account, checking your order status, or within the "Checkout" area. For example, the entire checkout process, from introduction to final confirmation, is completely secure. Is my information secure when it's transmitted across the Internet? All of your information is encrypted before it's transmitted across the Internet, then decoded only after it arrives at our secure servers.

Also, please keep in mind that it is best to measure while you're wearing undergarments, not a shirt or pants. bust: Place the measuring tape under your arms and measure around the fullest part of your bustline. waist: Measure around the narrowest part of your torso, usually above your belly button. hips: With your feet together, measure around the fullest part of your hips, usually at the top of your legs. arm length: Measure from your shoulder ball joint to your wrist bone. inseam: Measure from the top of your inner thigh down to your ankle bone. who can wear petites? The most flattering petite fit not only addresses height, but proportions, too. Petite sizing is designed for women 5'4" and under, but there are other factors that determine who should wear petites. If you have narrow shoulders or proportionately shorter arms, you may be able to wear petite tops. If your legs are proportionately shorter than your torso, you may want to try petite pants and skirts. It's a proportion, not a size.® Christopher & Banks offers the perfect fit for your size. We have proportionally adjusted the bust, waist, and hip measurements to different dimensions for Missy, Women and Petite figures—it's what makes your sizing unique. Christopher & Banks creates clothing scaled to proportionately accurate sizing, rather than making the same dimensions larger or smaller. We are happy to offer this variety and hope you find some beautiful additions for your wardrobe that fit your body, just as it is. missy *Please note: Size chart measurements are for one's body and not for the garment.

He opened it with "Her" in mind: local women who were full of life and wisdom, confident in their beliefs, and in search of wardrobes that reflected their lifestyle and made them feel fabulous at a price they loved. In the decades that followed, the trends and company name have ebbed with the times while the mission has endured—outfitting women in confidence and style. In 2000, CJ Banks launched to meet the underserved needs of women's sizes 14-24 and continues to be a pillar of our brand. Today, Christopher & Banks still focuses on putting Her first by providing our customers with the design, value and service which helps her look and feel amazing, in everyday life and in her most special moments. Carefully created with real women in mind we offer missy, women's, and petite sizes for an effortless experience to finding the perfect fit.

This notice is required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) which only applies to residents of California. For more information about our information collection practices and procedures, and about the rights of California residents under the CCPA , please visit our Privacy Policy page . The term "sell" is very broadly defined under the CCPA. Under the CCPA, "sell" means sell, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer, or otherwise communicate orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means a consumer's personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. California residents have the right to direct us, at any time, not to sell their personal information to third parties. This is called the right to opt out. The purpose of this notice is to advise California residents that we may sell your personal information within the meaning of the CCPA. To exercise this right, California residents may opt-out by emailing privacy@christopherandbanks.com and indicating in the e-mail, (i) your name, address and e-mail address, (ii) that you are a resident of California, and (iii) you are exercising your right to opt-out of the "sale" of your personal information. You may also make this request by calling our Customer Service Department at 800-890-9601, and providing the same information and request. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise this right. However, the law contains exceptions to the definition of selling which may limit how we may respond to your request. For example, selling does not include (i) performing services on behalf of Christopher & Banks whether directly or through a service provider such as servicing accounts, processing payments etc. or (ii) auditing related to a current interaction with a California resident. California residents can also authorize another person, called an agent, to opt out of the sale of their personal information on their behalf. When a California resident uses an authorized agent to exercise his or her right to opt out, we may require proof that the agent has been authorized by the resident to act on his or behalf, including a written confirmation from the resident confirming the authorization.

The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community. Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. … READ MORE Committees Committee on Public Housing (Chair) Committee on Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Aging Committee on General Welfare Subcommittee on Senior Centers and Food Insecurity Caucuses Black, Latino and Asian Caucus Chris Banks represents the 42nd Council District which includes the communities of East New York, Starrett City, Brownsville, Canarsie, Remsen Village, and East Flatbush.  He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.
