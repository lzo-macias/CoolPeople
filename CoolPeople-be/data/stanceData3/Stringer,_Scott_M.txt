VISION. EXPERIENCE. COMPETENCE. SCOTT STRINGER For New York City Mayor SCOTT STRINGER For New York City Mayor VISION. EXPERIENCE. COMPETENCE. SCOTT STRINGER For New York City Mayor Scott’s Letter to New Yorkers My vision for the future of New York City matches yours. My vision of the city is strong, safe communities where people can afford to live, stay, and put down roots. A city that continues to attract people because it’s a place where building a good life isn’t so hard. A city where a New York state of mind and peace of mind are one and the same. Why Scott New York City is broken. Families are being priced out of their homes, crime is shaking the foundation of our neighborhoods, and schools are leaving our children behind. Three years of chaos and pay-to-play politics have eroded the trust New Yorkers once had in City Hall. This isn’t just mismanagement—it’s a betrayal of the compact between the city and its people. Scott Stringer represents a stark contrast: a proven reformer with three decades of experience cleaning up government. He conducted the most in-depth and highest-impact audits of any New York City Comptroller, exposing waste and corruption, saving billions in taxpayer dollars. He's replaced patronage with merit-based hiring. He's held bad actors accountable and delivered billions in savings for taxpayers. Scott’s leadership has shown that we can fix what’s broken and build a city where opportunity thrives. As mayor, Scott will prioritize the most pressing issues facing New Yorkers: affordable housing, public safety, reliable transit, and strong schools. His vision is clear: a city that’s safe, affordable, and thriving—where loving New York doesn’t have to be so hard. This is the time to restore competence, transparency, and trust in City Hall, and Scott is ready to lead the charge. “We’ve fixed big problems before, and we can do it again,” Scott says. “This isn’t the moment for empty promises or on-the-job training. It’s a moment for bold action and proven leadership. This isn’t just mismanagement—it’s a betrayal of the compact between the city and its people.

He’s committed to ensuring no New Yorker is worried when getting on the subway, sitting in the park, or walking down the street. ETHICS AND CORRUPTION Corruption at City Hall has robbed New Yorkers of affordable housing, functioning schools, and safer streets. Scott’s plan puts transparency and accountability at the center. HOUSING Scott knows that housing in New York City is broken; skyrocketing rents and a system stacked against working families threaten the stability of our city. His bold housing plan tackles both affordability and access. OUR KIDS Childcare is in crisis in New York City, and families are paying the price. Scott’s plan ensures every family has the support they need to thrive. SANITATION Scott will start picking up the trash. His comprehensive sanitation plan will transform New York City’s waste management system into a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable operation. RAINY DAY FUND The $1 billion “Very Rainy Day Fund” ensures New York City can continue essential services, reinforce its independence, and ensure that the federal government cannot dictate the city’s priorities through coercion.

However the articles can get quite lengthy, and I think this is true for a lot of articles on the Wiki across all sorts of niches. This might deter certain readers and makes the information here less accessible when some of it is already not easy to get.  I'm wondering if the community has any ideas on how to offer the information in a way that is still useful and complete, but in some other way that is easy for them to consume. Obviously there can't be multiple articles created for each page, and there are already sections, but I'd like to know if there can be discussion about this, and if Wikipedia already has tools to help create articles of information in alt formats such as slideshows or video. Also what you all think about this, and why/how you are using simple Wikipedia.

It appears that unlike EN wiki that has a separate page for requested moves, here we have to put forth such requests on this page. The page in question is Razia Sultana which I think should be moved to Razia Sultan based on WP:COMMONNAME principle. There was a recent discussion at Talk:Razia Sultan on EN wiki which determined the common name to be "Razia Sultan", hence my attempt to have the page moved. I would appreciate it if one of the page movers or administrators could look into the matter. Thanks.

To make it do this, set the Threshold for stub display higher than 0. This makes it easy to find or fix (make into a longer article) a stub. See Special:Preferences to set your threshold, or Help:User preferences for more help on this and other settings. I looked in my preferences and didn't see anything like that. A comment five years ago remarked on this. If this is outdated, it should be removed from the page and that section should be rewritten. TagUser ( talk ) 23:07, 23 April 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] [ reply ] [ ]  Request for Admin Assistance: Duplicate or Overlapping Articles   [ change source ] [ change source ] Hello Admin,  I recently created the article titled 2025 Pahalgam attack , but I noticed that another article, 2025 Pahalgam Massacre , already exists. Upon review, the latter appears to have been created recently and seems to largely replicate content from the English Wikipedia, potentially copy-pasted. Both articles refer to the same incident, and having two separate entries may cause confusion or redundancy. I kindly request your assistance in reviewing both pages and making a decision—whether to merge, redirect, or retain only one with proper sourcing and neutrality. Thank you for your time and help in maintaining the quality and consistency of Wikipedia.

The related link is: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_deletion/Requests/2025/Viruses/Did_you_know/1  The person opening up the RfD - and closing it - deleting the article, is the same person. He also deleted another article with no RfD at all. He also made a post on my talk page to carry over a discuss from his talk page that I don't think he wanted to take part in anymore - and so did another DYK admin (Did you know). I am doing so because he is an admin and I am a normal user and the only other eyes on this is his buddy - I hope you understand. This is normal practise - even in real life - and still doesn't mean I am personally going against him now or in the future no matter the outcome if I wanted to wish him all the best before he gave his own talk/article approval.

It may not be circumvented, eroded, or ignored by Wikimedia Foundation officers or staff nor local policies of any Wikimedia project . Please note that in the event of any differences in meaning or interpretation between the original English version of this content and a translation, the original English version takes precedence. It may not be circumvented, eroded, or ignored by Wikimedia Foundation officers or staff nor local policies of any Wikimedia project .  Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may: Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account . Register for an account without providing an email address or real name. Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you: Make public contributions .

We are committed to: Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy. Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure . Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes. Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites , to comply with the law , or to protect you and others .

Be aware: Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available . If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in , that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username. Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop ) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services ). As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.  Introduction  Use of info  Sharing  Protection  Important info   Introduction     Welcome!  The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia , Wikimedia Commons , and Wiktionary . This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information. We collect very little Personal Information about you. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties. By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy. The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial. We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important. We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.  After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.    Definitions  We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful. Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:  "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites.

When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy , as well as other, tool-specific policies. Tool providers . We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org . When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on. Other users . We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include: posting to Foundation-hosted email lists; requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info wikimedia.org goes to this system); emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel). Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of: Websites run by other organizations , like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations . These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals . These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies. Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy wikimedia.org so we can investigate. This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy ); donate.wikimedia.org , including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy ); and The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension , which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy . This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded. Administrative volunteers , such as CheckUsers or Stewards .

If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy wikimedia.org so we can investigate.    Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy , the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.    Collection & Use of Info      Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It    Your Public Contributions Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone. When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy. Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions. You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions. You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.    Account Information & Registration  You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site. If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example). If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address . Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem! You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.  If you want to create a standard account , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.  Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information. Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.    Location Information   GPS & Other Location Technologies  Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ .    Metadata Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.    IP Addresses Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location .    Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites. Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.    Information We Receive Automatically Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites. Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.    Information We Collect We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you. We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels , JavaScript , and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage . These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them. Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information. We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org . Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like: Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area. Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in. Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you. Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ .  We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.  While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.     How We Use Information We Receive From You General We and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of pursuing our charitable mission, including: To help you share your knowledge with the world and add new features to our Services.

Other Location information GPS & Other Location Technologies  As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.  Metadata As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.  IP Addresses When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."    Sharing     When May We Share Your Information?  We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.   With Your Permission We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ .    For Legal Reasons We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you. For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ .    If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!)  In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.    To Protect You, Ourselves & Others  We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies; protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person. We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations. We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions. Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy . These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation. We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)    To Our Service Providers We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission. We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ . If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page .    To Understand & Experiment  We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites. When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest. The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites. When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ .)    Because You Made It Public Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone. Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.    Protection     How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?  We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email .    How Long Do We Keep Your Data?  Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law. Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ .) Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines .   Your rights If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us. For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ .

Important info   For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.   Where is the Foundation & What Does That Mean for Me?  The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy.

Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ .    Changes to This Privacy Policy Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

We reserve the right to do so in the following manner: In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list. For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list. We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

For our official legal version, please see the English-language Wikipedia . Wikipedia is an encyclopedia on the Internet that is edited by anyone who wants to help. The way it works means that anyone with who can view the Internet can change what is written. When you read Wikipedia, you should remember that we cannot make sure that our information is checked by people who can make it complete, accurate or reliable. That does not mean that there is not useful, correct information in Wikipedia; there is lots.  However, Wikipedia cannot make sure the information here is correct. Any article may have been changed or vandalized by someone who thinks they know what is correct, but is not aware of the current facts of the topics they are writing about. No system of checks by experts   We are developing ways to find versions of articles which are more correct, and show them to our readers. The people who help make Wikipedia use up-to-date lists like the Special:Recentchanges and Special:Newpages to watch new and changing pages. However, Wikipedia is not all checked by experts. Although readers might correct errors and some experts may check some articles , they do not have a duty to make changes. So, just because we have information here, this does not mean that we think it is all true, or useful for anything you want to do with it. We are not promising you that it is correct. Before you think that something might be correct, remember that all articles might have been badly changed to be wrong just before you see them, even ones that had - before - been checked by experts or chosen as very good articles . None of the editors, sponsors or administrators of Wikipedia, or anyone else connected with Wikipedia in any way at all can be responsible (their fault) for any information that is not correct. It is also not their fault if you use any of the information which is either at Wikipedia, or information on a page somewhere else which we have a web link to. No contract; limited license    Please make sure that you understand that the information provided here is being provided freely, and that no kind of agreement or contract is created between you and the owners or users of this site, the owners of the servers upon which it is housed, the individual Wikipedia contributors, any project administrators, sysops or anyone else who is in any way connected with this project or sister projects subject to your claims against them directly. You are being granted a limited license to copy anything from this site; it does not create or imply any contractual or extracontractual liability on the part of Wikipedia or any of its agents, members, organizers or other users. There is no agreement or understanding between you and Wikipedia regarding your use or modification of this information beyond the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA) and the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL); neither is anyone at Wikipedia responsible should someone change, edit, modify or remove any information that you may post on Wikipedia or any of its associated projects. Trademarks   Any of the trademarks, service marks, collective marks, design rights or similar rights that are mentioned, used or cited in the articles of the Wikipedia encyclopedia are the property of their respective owners. Their use here does not imply that you may use them for any other purpose other than for the same or a similar informational use as contemplated by the original authors of these Wikipedia articles under the GFDL licensing scheme. Unless otherwise stated Wikipedia and Wikimedia sites are neither endorsed nor affiliated with any of the holders of any such rights and as such Wikipedia cannot grant any rights to use any otherwise protected materials. Your use of any such or similar incorporeal property is at your own risk. Personality rights   Wikipedia contains material which may portray an identifiable person who is alive or deceased recently. The use of images of living or recently deceased individuals is, in some jurisdictions, restricted by laws pertaining to personality rights , independent from their copyright status. Before using these types of content, please ensure that you have the right to use it under the laws which apply in the circumstances of your intended use. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you do not infringe someone else's personality rights. Jurisdiction and legality of content   Publication of information found in Wikipedia may be in violation of the laws of the country or jurisdiction from where you are viewing this information. The Wikipedia database is stored on a server in the State of Florida in the United States of America , and is maintained in reference to the protections afforded under local and federal law. Laws in your country or jurisdiction may not protect or allow the same kinds of speech or distribution. Wikipedia does not encourage the violation of any laws; and cannot be responsible for any violations of such laws, should you link to this domain or use, reproduce, or republish the information contained herein. Not professional advice   If you need specific advice (for example, medical, legal, financial, or risk management) please seek a professional who is licensed or knowledgeable in that area.

It is at the southern end of the U.S. state of New York . Over 8 million people currently live in the city, and over 22 million people live in the bigger New York metropolitan area . It is the financial capital of the U.S. because it is home to the nation's stock market , Wall Street , and the One World Trade Center . New York City is on one of the world's largest natural harbors . It is made up of five boroughs , each of which is a county of the state of New York . [ 9 ] The five boroughs— Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , the Bronx , and Staten Island —were combined into one city in 1898. [ 10 ] The city and its metropolitan area are an important place for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, [ 11 ] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York has more than 3.2 million people born outside the United States, [ 12 ] the biggest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] New York City started as a trading post created by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. [ 15 ] In 1664, the English controlled the city and the areas around it, [ 15 ] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England gave the lands to his brother, the Duke of York . [ 16 ] New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, [ 17 ] and has been the biggest U.S. city since 1790. [ 18 ] The Statue of Liberty welcomed millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [ 19 ] and it is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace . [ 20 ] In the 21st century, New York has grew into a global hub of creativity and entrepreneurship [ 21 ] and environmental sustainability, [ 22 ] [ 23 ] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. [ 24 ] In 2019, New York was voted the best city in the world in a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, because of its cultural diversity. [ 25 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist places in 2013. [ 26 ] A record 62.8 million tourists came to New York City in 2017. Times Square is the colorful area of the Broadway Theater District, [ 27 ] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] and a famous area for the world's entertainment industry . [ 30 ] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers , [ 31 ] and parks are known around the world. Manhattan's real estate market is one of the most expensive in the world. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] New York has more Chinese people outside of China than anywhere in the world, with many Chinatowns across the city. The New York City Subway is the biggest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University , New York University , Rockefeller University , and the City University of New York system, which is the biggest urban public university system in the United States. [ 34 ] The world's two largest stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange , located on Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, and NASDAQ , headquartered in Midtown Manhattan , are both in Manhattan. New York have started from Enbuilting Tower and Grattacielis in nome of Frank Greco, from 1945 and Togni's 1948, and with magyas of Robertson, after 1981. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] History [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Name [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In 1664, the city was named after the Duke of York , who would become King James II of England . James's older brother, King Charles II , had chosen the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland , including the city of New Amsterdam , which England had recently taken from the Dutch. [ 35 ] [ ] Early history [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The oldest part of the city, the island of Manhattan , still has its original Lenape name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canaries had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500s. When Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524, he gave to this site the name of New Angoulême in the honor of Francois 1st. In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while looking for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company . [ 36 ] Hudson's first mate said it was "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river was "a mile broad" and "full of fish". [ 37 ] [ ] [ ] Juan Rodriguez ( transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues ) was one of the first people associated with Europe to live there. He was a merchant from Santo Domingo. He was born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, and he came to Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14. He trapped for pelts and traded with the local people as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway , from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ ] [ ] Dutch control [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] New York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York Netherland ( New Netherland ) and they named a fort and town on the south end of Brooklyn. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting for the Dutch West India Company, bought the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie , a small Lenape band. [ 40 ] He paid "the value of 60 guilders" [ 41 ] (about $900 in 2018). [ 42 ] A false story says that Manhattan was bought for $24 worth of glass beads. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] 1626 was also the year the Dutch began to bring black slaves there. [ 45 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] After the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. [ 46 ] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant started his job as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During this time, the number of people of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Island New Amsterdam ( New Amsterdam ), [ 49 ] after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second Anglo-Dutch War . They changed the name to New York , to honor the Duke of York , who later became King James II of England and James VII of Scotland. The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. [ ] English control [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] By the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen ( Brooklyn ), Vlissingen ( Flushing ), and Nieuw Haarlem ( Harlem ). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. Dutch , English and other people had been living together in New York for a long time. New York became more important as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. [ 50 ] It also became a center of slavery as the British increased the slave trade and built a slave market in the city. [ 45 ] 42% of households owned slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina . [ 51 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to create the freedom of the press in North America. [ 52 ] In 1754, Columbia University was created under charter by King George II ; it was called King's College, and it was in Lower Manhattan. [ 53 ] [ ] [ ] American Revolution [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty . It organized in the city, and they skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. [ 54 ] The  important Battle of Long Island of the American Revolution was fought in Brooklyn in 1776; it was the biggest battle of the war. [ 55 ] The Americans lost the battle. The British used the area as its headquarters for the war in North America. [ ] [ ] New York was the capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1788.  When the US Constitution was made, it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790. [ 56 ] In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington , was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each met for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was written, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. [ 57 ] By 1790, New York grew bigger than Philadelphia , so it become the biggest city in the United States. By the end of 1790, because of the Residence Act, Philadelphia became the new capital. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Nineteenth century [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] During the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from ~60,000 to ~3.43 million. [ 60 ] The number of black people in New York City reached more than 16,000 in 1840. [ 61 ] Even though slavery and the slave trade were abolished in New York, the slave trade continued illegally for many years. [ 62 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The Great Irish Famine brought a many Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, more than a quarter of the city's population. [ 63 ] There was also many people from German provinces, and Germans made up another 25% of New York's population by 1860. [ 64 ] [ ] [ ] During the American Civil War , many white people in the city supported the Confederate States of America , and July 1863 they killed many black New Yorkers in a riot. [ 45 ] [ ] Modern history [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the western towns in Queens County to make Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today.  Around this time, many new immigrants came into New York City.  They came in at Ellis Island , an island in New York's harbor near the Statue of Liberty .  Many of them then moved to the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan, which had over a million people living in just a few square miles. Early in the twentieth century, with better transportation, more people moved to outer parts of the greater city, and many commuted to Manhattan. Many skyscrapers and other big buildings were put up to provide places to work. In the 1970s, many jobs were lost due to industrial restructuring . This caused New York City to have economic problems and high crime rates. [ 65 ] Though the financial industry grew, which greatly helped the city's economy in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. [ 66 ] By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop a lot due to different police strategies, better economic opportunities, gentrification , and new residents, both Americans and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America . Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, started in the city's economy. [ 67 ] New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census. [ ] [ ] [ ] New York had most of the economic damage and biggest loss of human life from the September 11, 2001 attacks . [ 68 ] Two of the four planes taken over that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 police officers. The North Tower became the tallest building ever to be destroyed anywhere. [ 69 ] [ ] [ ] Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. [ 70 ] [ ] Geography [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was at the edge of a big ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) deep. [ 71 ] Erosion and the ice moving lead to the creation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island . It also left bedrock at a shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers. [ 72 ] [ ] [ ] New York City is located in the Northeastern United States , in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston . [ 73 ] The city includes all of Manhattan Island and Staten Island , and the western end of Long Island . There are also many smaller islands. [ ] Water divides several parts of the city. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York , the river is an estuary . [ 74 ] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey . Part of the Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side, and the State of New Jersey on the other side. The East River forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of Long Island Sound separates the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as Rockaway in Queens and City Island in the Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and belongs to the United Nations Headquarters . The country of Somalia is the only country whose national flag copied the colors of the UN. [ 75 ] The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city. [ 76 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km 2 ), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km 2 ) of land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km 2 ) of this is water. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] The tallest place in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island. It is at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level , and it is the tallest place on the Eastern Seaboard that is south of Maine .

Also see File:US Flag spec TIOH 5-1-17 1967.jpg , the specification drawing from the Army Institute of Heraldry. The official colors are part of the Standard Color Reference of America , specifically Cable Nos. 75001 ("White") , 70180 ("Old Glory Red") , and 70075 ("Old Glory Blue") . Colorimetric designations for these colors were precisely specified in a 1946 paper in JOSA . When the white point is taken to have the luminous reflectance of the flag’s white, these colors can be approximated on screen as , , and , respectively. The United State Department of State uses (#FFFFFF), (#B31942) and (#0A3161) in RGB color. United States Department of State Identity and Marking Standards          The current dimensions of the image (version of 00:43, 14 May 2008), 1235 × 650 pixels (which represents an aspect ratio of 1.9:1.0), were chosen to allow as much as possible of the final geometric manipulations to be performed using whole numbers, avoiding the need for scaling.  (This also results in each stripe being 50 pixels high.)

The Simple English Wikipedia's articles can be used to help with school homework or just for the fun of learning about new ideas . Non-English Wikipedias can also translate from the articles here. Wikipedia started on January 15 , 2001 and it has over 35,000,000 articles in many languages, including 267,493 in Simple English. Most of these articles are in languages other than English. Every day, hundreds of people from around the world make hundreds of changes and create lots of new articles. Note: Wikipedia has pages that some people might think are bad, vulgar, or mean. Read the Wikipedia content disclaimer for more information. Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and grammar that is easier to understand than the normal English Wikipedia . The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs, such as children , students , and adults with learning difficulties , and people who are trying to learn English. Other people may use the Simple English Wikipedia because simple language helps them to understand unfamiliar topics or complex ideas. When the Simple English Wikipedia began, the normal English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias in other languages had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the normal English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article. For this reason, people writing Simple English articles should put in " interwiki links " to and from the other Wikipedias. Also, it is good to always look at all versions in all languages, to get new ideas. " Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not " has a good list of things which we are not doing. These things are a little different from the things the normal English Wikipedia does not do. For example, in the Simple English version it is more important to explain slang , idioms , and jargon . The Simple English Wikipedia also has some articles that are also on Wiktionary .

These cookies would allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as "like" and "share" buttons. When a third party provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services. If you ever come across a third-party cookie transferred to your device during your access of the Wikimedia wiki sites, where you did not take any action to authorize the use and/or transfer of that cookie  (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report that cookie to us at privacy wikimedia.org . privacy wikimedia.org   A note about Wikimedia Foundation non-wiki sites: Some non-wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites are hosted by a third-party service provider. Sites hosted by WordPress VIP may have the WordPress Stats module enabled. Stats is a service that allows us to understand how many visitors we get to our WordPress-hosted non-wiki sites, their location by country, and which pages, posts and links are the most popular. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider, Automattic/WordPress, have access to the raw Stats data, which is retained for a maximum of 30 days. For more information about Stats, see WordPress' support page on the module . Sites hosted by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., known as Discourse forums, use cookies for functionality purposes and to store preferences. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider have access to the raw data. For more information about the cookies and their retention periods, see Discourse's information about cookies . Please note that the Wikimedia Foundation has not configured its Discourse forums to use Google Analytics, serve advertisements, or process donations; Discourse cookies related to those purposes are not used in our Sites.  What are my cookie options?  While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and other locally stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them. You can: remove or disable specific locally stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent); use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or install a plug-in to block locally stored data, if one is available. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.

Policy Policy Enforcement guidelines Enforcement guidelines Coordinating Committee (U4C) ( charter ) Coordinating Committee (U4C) ( charter ) Frequently asked questions Frequently asked questions Project overview Project overview Training modules Training modules Why we have a Universal Code of Conduct We believe in empowering as many people as possible to actively participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces, to reach our vision of a world in which everyone can share in the sum of all human knowledge. We believe our communities of contributors should be as diverse, inclusive, and accessible as possible. We want these communities to be positive, safe and healthy environments for anyone who joins (and wants to join) them. We are committed to ensuring that it remains so, including by embracing this Code of Conduct and revisiting for updates as needed. Also, we wish to protect our projects against those who damage or distort the content. In line with the Wikimedia mission, all who participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces will: Help create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge Be part of a global community that will avoid bias and prejudice, and Strive towards accuracy and verifiability in all its work This Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) defines a minimum set of guidelines of expected and unacceptable behaviour. It applies to everyone who interacts and contributes to online and offline Wikimedia projects and spaces. This includes new and experienced contributors, functionaries within the projects, event organizers and participants, employees and board members of affiliates and employees and board members of the Wikimedia Foundation. It applies to all Wikimedia projects, technical spaces, in-person and virtual events, as well as the following instances: Private, public and semi-public interactions Discussions of disagreement and expression of solidarity across community members Issues of technical development Aspects of content contribution Cases of representing affiliates/communities with external partners 1 – Introduction  The Universal Code of Conduct provides a baseline of behaviour for collaboration on Wikimedia projects worldwide. Communities may add to this to develop policies that take account of local and cultural context, while maintaining the criteria listed here as a minimum standard. The Universal Code of Conduct applies equally to all Wikimedians without any exceptions. Actions that contradict the Universal Code of Conduct can result in sanctions. These may be imposed by designated functionaries (as appropriate in their local context) and/or by the Wikimedia Foundation as the legal owner of the platforms. 2 – Expected behaviour  Every Wikimedian, whether they are a new or experienced editor, a community functionary, an affiliate or Wikimedia Foundation board member or employee, is responsible for their own behaviour. In all Wikimedia projects, spaces and events, behaviour will be founded in respect, civility, collegiality, solidarity and good citizenship. This applies to all contributors and participants in their interaction with all contributors and participants, without exceptions based on age, mental or physical disabilities, physical appearance, national, religious, ethnic and cultural background, caste, social class, language fluency, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex or career field. Nor will we make exceptions based on standing, skills or accomplishments in the Wikimedia projects or movement. 2.1 – Mutual respect  We expect all Wikimedians to show respect for others. In communicating with people, whether in online or offline Wikimedia environments, we will treat each other with mutual respect. This includes but is not limited to: Practice empathy. Listen and try to understand what Wikimedians of different backgrounds want to tell you. Be ready to challenge and adapt your own understanding, expectations and behaviour as a Wikimedian. Assume good faith, and engage in constructive edits; your contributions should improve the quality of the project or work. Provide and receive feedback kindly and in good faith. Criticism should be delivered in a sensitive and constructive manner. All Wikimedians should assume unless evidence otherwise exists that others are here to collaboratively improve the projects, but this should not be used to justify statements with a harmful impact. Respect the way that contributors name and describe themselves. People may use specific terms to describe themselves. As a sign of respect, use these terms when communicating with or about these people, where linguistically or technically feasible. Examples include: Ethnic groups may use a specific name to describe themselves, rather than the name historically used by others; People may have names that use letters, sounds, or words from their language which may be unfamiliar to you; People who identify with a certain sexual orientation or gender identity using distinct names or pronouns; People having a particular physical or mental disability may use particular terms to describe themselves Ethnic groups may use a specific name to describe themselves, rather than the name historically used by others; People may have names that use letters, sounds, or words from their language which may be unfamiliar to you; People who identify with a certain sexual orientation or gender identity using distinct names or pronouns; People having a particular physical or mental disability may use particular terms to describe themselves During in-person meetings, we will be welcoming to everyone and we will be mindful and respectful of each other's preferences, boundaries, sensibilities, traditions and requirements. 2.2 – Civility, collegiality, mutual support and good citizenship  We strive towards the following behaviours: Civility is politeness in behaviour and speech amongst people, including strangers. Collegiality is the friendly support that people engaged in a common effort extend to each other. Mutual support and good citizenship means taking active responsibility for ensuring that the Wikimedia projects are productive, pleasant and safe spaces, and contribute to the Wikimedia mission. This includes but is not limited to: Mentorship and coaching: Helping newcomers to find their way and acquire essential skills. Looking out for fellow contributors: Lend them a hand when they need support, and speak up for them when they are treated in a way that falls short of expected behaviour as per the Universal Code of Conduct. Recognize and credit the work done by contributors: Thank them for their help and work. Appreciate their efforts and give credit where it is due. 3 – Unacceptable behaviour  The Universal Code of Conduct aims to help community members identify situations of bad behaviour. The following behaviours are considered unacceptable within the Wikimedia movement: 3.1 – Harassment  This includes any behaviour intended primarily to intimidate, outrage or upset a person, or any behaviour where this would reasonably be considered the most likely main outcome. Behaviour can be considered harassment if it is beyond what a reasonable person would be expected to tolerate in a global, intercultural environment. Harassment often takes the form of emotional abuse, especially towards people who are in a vulnerable position, and may include contacting workplaces or friends and family members in an effort to intimidate or embarrass. In some cases, behaviour that would not rise to the level of harassment in a single case can become harassment through repetition. Harassment includes but is not limited to: Insults: This includes name calling, using slurs or stereotypes, and any attacks based on personal characteristics. Insults may refer to perceived characteristics like intelligence, appearance, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), culture, caste, sexual orientation, gender, sex, disability, age, nationality, political affiliation, or other characteristics. In some cases, repeated mockery, sarcasm, or aggression constitute insults collectively, even if individual statements would not. Sexual harassment: Sexual attention or advances of any kind towards others where the person knows or reasonably should know that the attention is unwelcome or in situations where consent cannot be communicated. Threats: Explicitly or implicitly suggesting the possibility of physical violence, unfair embarrassment, unfair and unjustified reputational harm, or intimidation by suggesting gratuitous legal action to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want. Encouraging harm to others: This includes encouraging someone else to commit self-harm or suicide as well as encouraging someone to conduct violent attacks on a third party. Disclosure of personal data (Doxing): sharing other contributors' private information, such as name, place of employment, physical or email address without their explicit consent either on the Wikimedia projects or elsewhere, or sharing information concerning their Wikimedia activity outside the projects. Hounding: following a person across the project(s) and repeatedly critiquing their work mainly with the intent to upset or discourage them. If problems are continuing after efforts to communicate and educate, communities may need to address them through established community processes. Trolling: Deliberately disrupting conversations or posting in bad-faith to intentionally provoke. 3.2 – Abuse of power, privilege, or influence  Abuse occurs when someone in a real or perceived position of power, privilege, or influence engages in disrespectful, cruel, and/or violent behaviour towards other people. In Wikimedia environments, it may take the form of verbal or psychological abuse and may overlap with harassment. Abuse of office by functionaries, officials and staff: use of authority, knowledge, or resources at the disposal of designated functionaries, as well as officials and staff of the Wikimedia Foundation or Wikimedia affiliates, to intimidate or threaten others. Abuse of seniority and connections: Using one's position and reputation to intimidate others. We expect people with significant experience and connections in the movement to behave with special care because hostile comments from them may carry an unintended backlash. People with community authority have a particular privilege to be viewed as reliable and should not abuse this to attack others who disagree with them. Psychological manipulation: Maliciously causing someone to doubt their own perceptions, senses, or understanding with the objective to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want. 3.3 – Content vandalism and abuse of the projects  Deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate or inappropriate content, or hindering, impeding or otherwise hampering the creation (and/or maintenance) of content.
This includes but is not limited to: The repeated arbitrary or unmotivated removal of any content without appropriate discussion or providing explanation Systematically manipulating content to favour specific interpretations of facts or points of view (also by means of unfaithful or deliberately false rendering of sources and altering the correct way of composing editorial content) Hate speech in any form, or discriminatory language aimed at vilifying, humiliating, inciting hatred against individuals or groups on the basis of who they are or their personal beliefs The use of symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content that are intimidating or harmful to others outside of the context of encyclopedic, informational use. This includes imposing schemes on content intended to marginalize or ostracize. Policies Universal Code of Conduct This page was last edited on 30 March 2024, at 07:21.

It is divided into 50 states . 48 of these states and the District of Columbia border each other between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans . They are bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern area of the continent and is separated from the other 48 states by Canada making it an exclave . Alaska is bordered by Canada to its east. The state of Hawaii is a set of islands in the Pacific located within Polynesia and is about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) from the mainland. The country also possesses territories , and insular areas , in the Caribbean and Pacific. The capital city is Washington, D.C and the largest city by population is New York City with a population of 8.8 million people. With a population of 340.1 million people and an area of 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km 2 ), the United States is the third most populated country in the world and the fourth-largest country in the world by total area. The land that would one day become the United States was first settled by migrating tribes from Siberia that walked across a land bridge about 20,000 years ago during the Ice Age. These people were the ancestors of the Native Americans . European colonization began in the 16th and 17th century with several European nations setting up colonies in North America. The thirteen colonies of Great Britain along the Atlantic coast declared independence as a nation on July 4, 1776. They issued the Declaration of Independence , which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. The colonies defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War , making it the first successful colonial war of independence in history. [ 10 ] The Philadelphia Convention adopted the current United States Constitution on September 17, 1787; its approval the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The Bill of Rights , making up ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many basic civil rights and freedoms, was approved in 1791. [ ] In the 19th century, the United States had a legal policy of manifest destiny where they believed that it was their god given right to expand across the North American continent. They conquered and took over native lands and bought territory from France , the United Kingdom , Mexico , and Russia , and took over the Republic of Texas and later the Republic of Hawaii. Political arguments between the farming-based South and industrial North over the growth of the institution of slavery and states' rights began the American Civil War . In 1861, the southern states separated from the union and founded their own country called the Confederate States of America after anti-slavery candidate, Abraham Lincoln won the Presidential election. The Union's victory over the Confederacy prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world's largest. [ 11 ] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States came out of World War II as a superpower and was the first country with nuclear weapons . After World War II the United States along with its allies founded the United Nations. Today the United States is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . The United States also became engaged in an arms race called the Cold War with the Soviet Union . The United States participated in the Space Race against the Soviet Union that produced rapid advancements in rocket technology. They created the Apollo 11 rocket and it was the first to send people to the moon . It was done by NASA , an American space agency. It went up to space on July 16, 1969, carrying three astronauts: Neil Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins . On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon, while Collins stayed in orbit around the Moon. [ 12 ] In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up, ending the Cold War and leaving the United States as the only superpower. [ ] [ ] Today, the United States is one of the world's most ethnically mixed and multicultural nations. It is the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. [ 13 ] The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 20.9 trillion (about a quarter of worldwide GDP). [ ] Geography and environment [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States is a federal republic of fifty states , a federal district , and several territories . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,941 km 2 ). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km 2 ). Hawaii , occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific , southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km 2 ) in area. [ 17 ] [ ] The United States is the world's fourth largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia, Canada, and China or behind Russia , Canada , and ahead of China . The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055 km 2 ) [ 18 ] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091 km 2 ) [ 19 ] to 3,794,101 square miles (9,826,676 km 2 ). [ 20 ] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest . The Mississippi – Missouri River , the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north-south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast. The Rocky Mountains , at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado . Further west is the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave . The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast , both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet. The Alaskan Range passes through much of Alaska and is home to Denali which stands at a height of 20,310 ft (6,190 m) above sea level and is the tallest mountain in the United States and in North America. Denali is in fact the tallest mountain in the World on land from base to summit standing at about 18,000 ft (5,490 m), which is about 4,000 ft (1,220 m) higher than Mount Everest which sits at a height of about 14,000 ft (4,270 m) from base to summit. The United States, with its large size and geographical variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian , the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The southern tip of Florida is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-dry. Much of the western mountains are alpine . The climate is dry in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California , and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not unusual—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes , and most of the world's tornadoes happen within the country, mainly in the Midwest's Tornado Alley . [ 22 ] [ ] The U.S. ecology is considered " megadiverse "; about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. [ 23 ] The United States is home to more than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species. [ 24 ] About 91,000 insect species have been described. [ 25 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects threatened and endangered species and their habitats. They are watched by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service . There are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. [ 26 ] The United States government owns 28.8% of the country's land area. [ 27 ] Most of this is protected , but some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching. 2.4% is used for military purposes. [ 27 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] An example of animals that are native to the United States such as opossums , raccoons , pumas , and bears . Endangered animals in the United States include the jaguar , the California condor , and the Florida panther . There are many types of small trees and shrubs in the United States. Some of these are hackberries , hawthorn , serviceberry, blackberry , wild cherry, dogwood , and snowberry. Wildflowers grow all around the United States. They even grow in deserts and places with mountains. Wildflowers include forget-me-not , fringed and closed gentians, jack-in-the-pulpit, black-eyed Susan , columbine, and common dandelion , as well as many types of aster , orchid , lady's slipper , and wild rose. History [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Native Americans [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] It is believed that the indigenous peoples of the continental United States , including the natives of Alaska , moved in from Asia . They began arriving more than twelve thousand years ago, if not earlier. [ 28 ] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced farming, grand construction, and state-level communities. The native population of America decreased after Europeans arrived, and for different reasons, mostly sicknesses such as smallpox and measles . [ 29 ] [ ] [ ] European settlers [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus from Genoa , under contract to the Spanish crown, reached some Caribbean islands, making the first Contact with the native people. On April 2, 1513, Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León landed on what he called " La Florida " — the first recorded European coming on what would become the U.S. mainland. Spanish settlements in the area were followed by ones in the present-day southwestern United States that drew thousands through Mexico. French fur traders established outposts of New France around the Great Lakes ; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the Colony of Virginia in Jamestown in 1607 and the Pilgrims ' Plymouth Colony in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the Massachusetts Bay Colony resulted in a wave of relocation; by 1634, New England had been settled by some 10,000 Puritans . Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies. [ 30 ] Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower Hudson River , including New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island . [ ] Independence and expansion [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Tensions between American colonials and the British during the rebel period of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the American Revolutionary War , fought from 1775 through 1781. On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress , a meeting in Philadelphia , established a Continental Army led by George Washington .The Congress said that "all men are created equal" and are born with "certain natural rights ," and adopted the Declaration of Independence , written mostly by Thomas Jefferson , on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated every year as America's Independence Day . In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. Morocco was the first country in the world to recognize America’s independence. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ ] [ ] After the British defeat by American forces helped by the French , Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States and the states' sovereignty over American land west to the Mississippi River . A constitutional convention was organized in 1787 by people who wanted to establish a stronger national government, with powers of taxation. The United States Constitution was approved in 1788, and the new republic's first Senate, House of Representatives , and President (George Washington) took office in 1789. The Bill of Rights , forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and certifying a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. Attitudes toward slavery were shifting; a clause in the Constitution protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The northern states permanently stopped slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the slave states of the south as defenders of the "peculiar institution." The Second Great Awakening , beginning about 1800, made evangelicalism a force behind different social reform movements , including abolitionism . Americans' eagerness to expand westward caused a long series of Indian Wars and an Indian removal policy that removed native peoples from their land. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed land under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The War of 1812 , declared against Britain over different complaints and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism . A series of U.S. military invasions into Florida led Spain to give up it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States took over the Republic of Texas in 1845. The idea of Manifest destiny became popular during this time. [ 33 ] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. The U.S. victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest . The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 further encouraged western relocation. New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million American bison , or buffalo, were killed for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, which were valuable to the plains Indians , caused many native cultures to become gone forever. [ ] Civil War and industrialization [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over the relationship between the state and federal governments , as well as violent conflicts over the spread of slavery into new states. Abraham Lincoln , a candidate of the antislavery Republican Party , was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America . With the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter , the American Civil War began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation committed the Union to end slavery. Following the Union victory in 1865, three changes to the U.S. Constitution secured freedom for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, [ 34 ] made them citizens , and gave them voting rights . The war and its resolution led to a big increase in federal power . [ 35 ] [ ] [ ] After the war, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln was followed by the Reconstruction era , where policies were put together directed at getting back and rebuilding the Southern states while securing the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed 1876 presidential election by the Compromise of 1877 ended this era, and the Jim Crow laws soon began to negatively affect many African Americans. In the North, urbanization and a never-before-seen inflow of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe made the country's industrialization grow rapidly. The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, provided labor and changed American culture. High tax protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking laws also encouraged growth. The 1867 Alaska Purchase from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars . In 1893, the native monarchy of the Pacific Kingdom of Hawaii was ended in a secret and successful plan led by American residents. The United States took over the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the Spanish–American War the same year proved that the United States was a world power and led to the addition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines . The Philippines gained independence fifty years later. Puerto Rico and Guam are still U.S. territories. World War I, Great Depression, and World War II  [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The First World War started in Europe in 1914. The United States said it was neutral and did not join the war at first. Later, the Americans helped the British and French, even though many citizens, especially those from Ireland and Germany , were against it. [ 36 ] In 1917, the United States joined the Allies . They helped defeat the Central Powers . At the end of the war, many Americans did not want to stay involved in Europe.  The Senate did not approve the Treaty of Versailles (1919). The United States stayed out of the League of Nations . The country became more isolationist . [ 37 ] [ ] [ ] In 1920, the women's rights movement gained the approval of a constitutional amendment to grant women the right to vote . [ 38 ] For most of the 1920s, the country enjoyed a period of success, decreasing the inequality in the balance of payments while profiting from industrial farms. This period, known as the Roaring Twenties , ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that triggered the Great Depression . [ ] After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal , a series of policies that increased government interference in the economy. [ 39 ] From 1920 to 1933 a prohibition banning alcohol was in place. [ 40 ] The Dust Bowl of the 1930s left many poor farmer communities and encouraged a new wave of emigration to the West Coast. [ 41 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The United States, officially neutral during the early stages of World War II , began supplying supplies to the Allies in March 1941, through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the country joined the Allies' fight against the Axis Powers , after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . World War II boosted the economy by providing investment capital and jobs, making many women enter the labor market. Of the significant fighters, the United States was the only nation to be enriched by war. [ 42 ] The discussions at Bretton Woods and Yalta created a new system of an international organization that placed the country and the Soviet Union at the heart of world affairs. In 1945, when the the end of the Second World War in Europe came, and an international gathering held in San Francisco drafted the Charter of the United Nations, which came into force after the war. [ 43 ] Having developed the first nuclear weapon , the government decided to use it in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of that same year. Japan gave up on September 2, ending the war. [ 44 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Cold War and civil rights era [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union started the Cold War . This was because both of them thought their own type of government was the best. [ 45 ] The United States was supported by NATO , and the Soviet Union was supported by the Warsaw Pact . They never fought each other directly, but did many proxy wars . In the Korean War , the United States sent soldiers to help South Korea. They fought Chinese soldiers that were helping communist North Korea. [ 46 ] In the 1960s, the Cuban Missile Crisis almost led to a real war between the two countries. However, the Soviets agreed to take their missiles out of Cuba if the United States did not attack them. Because of the Cold War, many Americans were scared of communist spies taking over the United States. This started the Second Red Scare , and hundreds of people were arrested because they were communist. [ 47 ] Later, many cases in the Supreme Court made arresting communists illegal, because it is free speech. [ 48 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 1957, the Soviet Union launched a satellite named Sputnik 1 into outer space. Later, they were the first to put people in outer space . Because of this, President John F. Kennedy wanted to send a man to the Moon. This started the Space Race , and the United States began the Apollo program , a project used for outer space. In 1969, the United States launched Apollo 11 , and was the first country to send people to the Moon. [ 49 ] [ ] The economy of the United States grew a lot during the 1950s and 1960s, with Americans having the highest average income in the world. [ 50 ] Because of this, many people moved to large cities and suburbs , and had more children . The country built the Interstate Highway System , which made it easier to travel and move things across the country. [ 51 ] In 1959, Alaska and Hawaii became U.S. states. [ ] [ ] There were many social movements in the United States during this time. The Civil Rights Movement wanted to give African Americans more rights. It was led by people such as Rosa Parks , Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X . [ 52 ] It was very successful, and helped make many laws that protected African Americans, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1968 . John F. Kennedy was murdered in 1963, and Lyndon B. Johnson became the President. Johnson sent United States soldiers to the Vietnam War , and many people did not like this. This started the counterculture movement. [ 53 ] Counterculture included many things, such as people who wanted black nationalism , peace , and more rights for women . In 1969, the Stonewall riots in New York marked the start of the gay rights movement. [ 54 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 1974, Richard Nixon became the first President to resign. This was because of the Watergate scandal , where people broke into the Democratic headquarters and took a lot of information to help Nixon. [ 55 ] During the Yom Kippur War , the United States helped Israel . Because of this, countries in OPEC did not let the United States buy their oil. This started an oil crisis . In the 1970s, the country's economy had a problem with stagflation , something that happens when prices go up but production does not. When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he tried to stop this with lower taxes and less government control over the economy. [ 56 ] These changes were called Reaganomics . The Cold War ended in 1991. This was because the Soviet Union dissolved . With no Soviet Union, the United States became the largest superpower in the world. [ 57 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Modern history [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Under President George H. W. Bush , the country took on a global dominant role worldwide, as in the Gulf War (1991). The longest economic expansion in modern American history, from March 1991 to March 2001, spanned the presidency of Bill Clinton and the dot-com bubble. [ 58 ] A civil lawsuit and a sex scandal led to his impeachment in 1998, although he managed to finish his period. The 2000 presidential election was one of the most competitive in American history, it was settled by the Supreme Court : George W. Bush , son of George H. W. Bush, became president, even though he gained fewer votes than his opponent Al Gore . [ 59 ] [ ] [ ] On September 11, 2001, the terrorists of the Al-Qaeda group attacked the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City (which were destroyed) and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C. , in a series of attacks that killed nearly three thousand people. In response, the Bush administration launched the " War on Terror ." At the end of 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan , removed the Taliban government and destroyed Al-Qaeda's training camps. Taliban insurgents continued to fight a guerrilla war . In 2002, Bush began to discuss a regime change in Iraq . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] With a lack of support from NATO and without a clear UN order for military intervention, Bush organized a coalition of governments to begin an invasion. The coalition forces quickly invaded Iraq in 2003 and ended the government of Saddam Hussein . The following year, Bush was re-elected as the most voted president in an election . [ ] [ ] In 2005, Hurricane Katrina , which would end up being the deadliest natural disaster in national history, caused severe destruction along the Gulf Coast: the city of New Orleans was mostly destroyed, with 1833 dead. [ 62 ] [ ] On November 4, 2008, during a global economic downturn , Barack Obama was elected president, having been the first African American to take office. In May 2011, American Special forces managed to kill Osama bin Laden , hiding in Pakistan. The following year, Barack Obama was re-elected. Under his second term, he led the war against the Islamic State and restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. On November 8, 2016, the Republican Party leader Donald Trump defeated former First Lady Hillary Clinton for presidency. [ 63 ] [ ] The massacres in Orlando of June 12, 2016 at the gay disco Pulse (51 dead) and in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 (60) are listed as the largest massacres in the country since 9/11. [ 64 ] The murder of George Floyd in late May 2020 sparked protests all over the world that demanded racial justice. On January 6, 2021, the United States Capital in Washington, D.C. was stormed during a riot and violent attack against the U.S. Congress. [ ] Government [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation . It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy , "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law ." [ 65 ] The government is controlled by a system of checks and balances from the United States Constitution . The constitution is the country's main legal document . There are three branches. They are the executive branch , the legislative branch , and the judicial branch . State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways. Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch of a state government is led by a governor , instead of a president. [ ] Executive branch [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law. Members of the U.S. Electoral College elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the armed forces . The president may veto a bill that Congress has passed, so it does not become a law. The President may also make "executive orders" to ensure that people follow the law. The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of the government. For example, the Department of Commerce makes rules about trade. The president chooses the heads of these departments and also nominates federal judges. However, the Senate , part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms. Legislative branch [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The legislative branch makes laws. The legislative branch is called the United States Congress . Congress is divided into two "houses". One house is the House of Representatives . The Representatives are each elected by voters from set areas within the states. The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there. Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House . The other house is the Senate . In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. The President's treaties or appointments of officials need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate. In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president pro tempore , or temporary president, of the Senate. Representatives and senators propose laws, called " bills ", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a committee , which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority , the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president. Under the American system of federalism , Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national emergencies , to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique. Judicial branch [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution , the law is said to be "struck down" and is no longer a valid law. The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges , called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the chief justice , heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns . When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else. Famous court cases such as Marbury v Madison (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the United States Constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it. [ 66 ] [ ] Politics [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ]   The United States of America consists of 50 states , 5 territories, and 1 district ( Washington D.C .). States can make laws about things inside the state, but only federal laws can apply to more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) constitution. Each of these is like the federal constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws. The federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties : the Republicans and the Democrats . There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the Libertarian Party and the Green Party . People help in political campaigns that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called lobbying . All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it. The USA's large cultural , economic, and military influence has made the foreign policy of the United States , or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries. Political divisions [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] States [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States conquered and bought new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states , of which 48 of them are joined together to make up the contiguous United States . These states, called the "lower 48", can all be reached by road without crossing a border into another country. They go from the Atlantic to the east to the Pacific in the west. There are two other states which are not joined to the lower 48 states. Alaska can be reached by passing through British Columbia and the Yukon , both of which are part of Canada. Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Washington, D.C. , the national capital, is a federal district that was split from the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1791. Not part of any US state, it used to be in the shape of a square , with the land west of the Potomac River coming from Virginia and the land east of the river coming from Maryland. In 1846, Virginia took back its part of the land. Some people living in DC want it to become a state, or for Maryland to take back its land, so that they can have the right to vote in Congress. Territories and possessions [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States territories and possessions consist of sixteen lands that do not state, many of which are colonial territories . None of them have any land borders with the rest of the US. People live in five of these places, which are de facto American: Puerto Rico American Samoa Guam U.S. Virgin Islands Northern Mariana Islands The Philippines was a possession of the United States. Palau , the Federated States of Micronesia , and other Pacific island nations were governed by the United States as a United Nations "Trust Territory". All of these places have become independent : the Philippines in 1946, Palau in 1947, and Micronesia in 1986. The U.S. armed forces has bases in many countries, and the U.S. Navy 's base at Guantanamo Bay was rented from Cuba after that country had a Communist revolution. Counties and cities [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] All the states are divided into administrative subdivisions . Most of them are called counties , but Louisiana uses the word " parish ," and Alaska uses the word " borough ." There are many cities in the United States. One city in each state is the state capital , where the government of the state meets and the governor works. This city is not always the largest in its state. For example, the city with the most people living in is New York City in New York State , but the state capital is Albany, New York . Some other big cities are Los Angeles , California ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; Miami , Florida ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Las Vegas , Nevada ; Houston and Dallas , Texas ; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ; Boston , Massachusetts ; Denver , Colorado ; St. Louis , Missouri , Memphis , Tennessee , Atlanta , Georgia , San Francisco , California , San Diego and Detroit , Michigan . Foreign relations and military [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States is very influential in global economics, politics, and the military. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and the headquarters of the United Nations is in New York City. It is a member of the G7 , [ 67 ] G20 , and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development . Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions . However, Iran , North Korea , Bhutan , and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States. The United States has a " special relationship " with the United Kingdom [ 68 ] and strong ties with Canada , [ 69 ] Australia , [ 70 ] New Zealand , [ 71 ] Japan , [ 72 ] South Korea , [ 73 ] and Israel . [ 74 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The president is the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force . The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty, along with several hundred thousand each in the Reserves and National Guard for a total of 2.3 million troops. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors. [ 75 ] [ ] The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia . [ 76 ] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA. [ 77 ] The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. [ 78 ] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011; [ 79 ] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War . [ 80 ] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012; [ 81 ] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan . [ 82 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Economy [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States has a capitalist economy . The country has rich mineral resources , with many gold , coal , and uranium deposits. Farming makes the country among the top producers of, among others, corn ( maize ), wheat , sugar , and tobacco . Housing contributes about 15% to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. [ 83 ] America produces cars , airplanes , and electronics . About 3/4 of Americans work in the service industry . [ ] Science and technology [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The United States is the world's foremost scientific power. [ 84 ] It has the most Nobel Prize winners of any country. [ 85 ] The U.S. spends more on research and development than any other country. [ 86 ] It is the leading country in artificial intelligence development. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Notable American inventions are: [ 90 ] the telephone , the electric telegraph , the electric light , the cinema , the gramophone, the airplane , the internet , [ 91 ] and the video game console . [ 92 ] Although the U.S. did not invent the automobile , the world's first mass-produced car was American.

Many people are descended from Germany , England , Scotland , Ireland , Africa , and Italy . [ 95 ] 13% of the people in the United States are African-American . Most of them descend from the African slaves that were brought to America . African Americans are concentrated in the Southern United States . [ 96 ] Asian -Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast. For example, in California , Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state. Hispanic -Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation. Mexicans are the largest Hispanic national group, followed by Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Salvadorans and Dominicans. [ 97 ] The original peoples, called Native American , American Indians, or Amerindians and Inuit ( Eskimos ) are a very small group. There are 574 federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States. [ 98 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 11% of the people in the United States are foreign-born. 18% speak a language other than English at home. For people 25 and older, 80% are high school graduates while 25% have a bachelor's degree or higher. The 2000 Census counted self-reported ancestry . It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican Americans. The United States has the largest number of immigrants of any country in the world. The United States attracts immigrants from other countries due to the American Dream . Most immigrants in the United States come from Mexico, China , India , the Philippines and El Salvador . Money [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The social structure of the United States has a big range. This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others. The average ( median ) income for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002. However, the richest 1% of Americans have as much money as the poorest 90%. 51% of all households have access to a computer and 41% had access to the Internet in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004. Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002. There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans. The debt has grown to over $21,000,000,000,000. Religion [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] There are many different religions in the U.S. Statistically , the largest religion is Christianity , including groups such as Catholicism and Protestantism . Other religions include Hinduism , Islam , Judaism , Unitarian Universalism , Wicca , Druidry , Baha'i , Raelism , Zoroastrianism , Taoism , and Jainism . [ 99 ] Religions which were founded within the United States include Eckankar , Satanism , and Scientology . Native American religions have various animistic beliefs. [ ] The United States is one of the most religious countries in the Western World , and most Americans believe in God . The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down. 86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007. The others include Judaism (2.3%), Islam (0.8%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). Those who have no religion are at 16.1%. There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion. [ 100 ] [ ] Doubts about the existence of a God, gods or goddesses are higher among young people. [ 101 ] Among the non-religious population of the U.S., there are deists , humanists , ignostics , atheists , and agnostics . [ 102 ] [ ] [ ] Language [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] English ( American English ) is the de facto national language . Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws (such as U.S. naturalization requirements ) standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish , spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. [ 103 ] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law. [ 104 ] [ ] [ ] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. [ 105 ] Other states, such as California , order the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms. [ 106 ] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions. [ ] [ ] Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there. Many Native American languages in the United States are endangered. Education [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn eighteen (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at sixteen or seventeen. [ 107 ] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled. [ 108 ] [ ] [ ] Culture [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] American popular culture goes out to many places in the world. [ 109 ] It has a large influence on most places, especially the Western world. American music is everywhere, and American movies and television shows can be seen in most countries.

It is one of many symbols of the United States like the Bald Eagle . The 50 stars represent the 50 states. The red stands for courage , the blue stands for justice , and the white represents peace and cleanliness . The 13 stripes represent the 13 original colonies. Cuisine [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] A hamburger is one of the popular foods of the United States. Fast food in the United States is home to many regional cuisines such as the Cuisine of the Southern United States , also known as Southern food.

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About  Community Engagement  Policy & Legislation  Press Opportunities Get Help! Our Solutions for Addressing Maternal Health Disparities Latest Press April 22nd, 2025 Press Release April 22nd, 2025 Press Release NYC Public Advocate Responds to the Mayor's Lies on Immigration “For months, the mayor has lied to New Yorkers about what sanctuary cities are, claiming it is impossible to advance public safety under our current sanctuary laws. Yet today, with those laws still in place, he trumpeted a joint federal and local effort to get gangs and guns off the streets – disproving his own arguments. He willfully exploits conflation and confusion between legitimate law enforcement and the abuses he continues to support. “Following the specifics of the law, or being honest about them, has never been a focus for this mayor or this president. Just hours ago, the mayor said he didn’t have a problem with the Trump administration’s extralegal removal of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It seems that the real joint effort between the mayor and the White House is to lie about public safety for political gain, demonize immigrants, and weaponize fear to justify the worst of their actions.” Get Help! The Office of the Public Advocate assists with complaints and inquiries involving government-related services and regulations. From resolving housing complaints to combating abuse by agencies, the Office helps thousands of New Yorkers annually by improving transparency and accountability of City government.

Vuodesta 2009 hän toimi kaupungin oikeusasiamiehenä ja tuli silloin tunnetuksi ärhäkkäänä vasemmistopoliitikkona: hän haluaisi nostaa veroja parantaakseen lasten päivähoitoa ja koulutusmahdollisuuksia. Hän on myös luvannut laittaa kuriin New Yorkin hurjan vuokratason. [ 1 ] [ ] Marraskuun alussa 2013 de Blasio voitti New Yorkin pormestarinvaaleissa ylivoimaisesti vastaehdokkaansa republikaani Joe Lhotan. [ 2 ] de Blasion pormestarikausi päättyi vuodenvaihteessa 2021–2022.

It was used in ancient Rome as a title for the mother goddess , and in Medieval Christianity for the Virgin Mary . In current days , it is most often used to refer to the university or college a person went to. However, it may also refer to the song or hymn of a college or university. [ 1 ] [ ] The term alma mater can be traced back to eleventh-century Europe. The first known use of the term in reference to university was in 1088. The University of Bologna coined their motto “Alma Mater Studiorum,” (translated: “nourishing mother of studies”).

[ 1 ] Отец — Уоррен Уилхелм старший — американец немецкого происхождения, мать — Мария, дочь итальянских иммигрантов Джованни и Анны Де Блазио [ 3 ] [ 4 ] из города Беневенто . Вскоре семья Уилхелм переехала в Кембридж (Массачусетс) . [ 5 ] В 1968 году отец Уоррена ушёл из семьи, а через год его родители развелись. [ 6 ] В интервью в апреле 2012 года Де Блазио рассказал, что его отец был офицером армии США и воевал на Тихом океане во время Второй мировой войны, в частности участвовал в Битве за Окинаву , одним из самых кровопролитных сражений за всё время войны на Тихоокеанском фронте. По мнению Билла это отрицательно сказалось на психическом и моральном состоянии Уоррена-старшего и привело в дальнейшем к алкоголизму отца и разводу. После расставания родителей Уоррен-младший воспитывался семьёй матери. [ 7 ] В сентябре 2013 года Де Блазио рассказал, что его отец болел раком лёгких , а в 1979 году покончил с собой. [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] В 1983 году 22-летний Уоррен Уилхелм-младший официально изменил свою фамилию на Де Блазио-Уилхелм. Ко времени появления на общественной сцене в 1990 году он использовал имя Билл Де Блазио, так как в личной жизни его обычно звали «Билл» или «Билли». [ 7 ] Юридически имя Уоррен на имя Билл Де Блазио сменил в 2002 году , когда расхождение было отмечено во время выборов. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] В 1981 году Де Блазио получил стипендию Гарри Трумэна ( англ. Harry S. Truman Scholar ). [ 10 ] Получил степень бакалавра в Нью-Йоркском университете , а также степень магистра международных отношений в Школе международных отношений Колумбийского университета . [ 11 ] В 1983 году, будучи студентом Нью-Йоркского университета, совершил поездку в СССР . Harry S. Truman Scholar [ ] [ ] Начало карьеры  [ править | править код ] [ править | править код ] Свою карьеру начал в 1984 году , став сотрудником городской программы стипендиатов Нью-Йоркского департамента по делам несовершеннолетних. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] В 1987 году , вскоре после завершения аспирантуры в Колумбийском университете, Де Блазио стал политическим организатором общественно-юридической группы Quixote Center в штате Мэриленд , в 1980-х годах активно поддерживавшей правительство сандинистов в Никарагуа . В 1988 году он 10 дней провёл в Никарагуа как представитель Quixote Center, помогая распространять продовольствие и медикаменты. В то время Де Блазио был сторонником сандинистов, которым противостояла администрация президента Рейгана . [ 13 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] После возвращения из Никарагуа Б. де Блазио переехал в Нью-Йорк, где работал в некоммерческой организации , занимавшейся улучшением здравоохранения в Центральной Америке . [ 13 ] Продолжал поддерживать сандинистов в своё свободное время, присоединившись к группе Сеть солидарности с Никарагуа Большого Нью-Йорка ( англ. Nicaragua Solidarity Network of Greater New York ), которая проводила встречи и собирала средства для сандинистов. [ 13 ] Городской политикой Де Блазио занялся в 1989 году, став добровольным координатором избирательной кампании кандидата в мэры Нью-Йорка от демократов Дэвида Динкинса . [ 14 ] После победы своего кандидата де Блазио работал в мэрии в качестве помощника [ 15 ] . [ ] Nicaragua Solidarity Network of Greater New York [ ] [ ] [ ] В 1997 году при администрации президента Билла Клинтона Де Блазио был назначен региональным директором Министерства жилищного строительства и городского развития США в Нью-Йорке и Нью-Джерси . На своём посту де Блазио сумел добиться увеличения федерального финансирования на цели строительства доступного жилья и обеспечением жильём пожилых людей. [ 16 ] В 1999 году он был избран членом школьного совета сообщества 15 ( англ. Community School Board 15 ). [ 17 ] В 2000 году де Блазио был руководителем кампании по выборам Хиллари Клинтон в Сенат США . [ 17 ] [ ] Community School Board 15 [ ] [ ] Городской совет Нью-Йорка  [ править | править код ] [ править | править код ] В 2001 году Де Блазио решил баллотироваться в депутаты Нью-Йоркского горсовета от 39-го округа в Бруклине, в который входят Боро-Парк , Кэрролл Гарденс , Коббл Хилл , Гованус , Кенсингтон , Парк Слоуп и Виндзор Террес . В сентябре 2001 года он выиграл первичные выборы , получив 5 161 голосов (32,12 %) и опередив 5 соперников. [ 18 ] На выборах 6 ноября Де Блазио набрал 18 131 голос (71,04 %), опередив кандидатов от республиканцев , « зелёных » и консерваторов . [ 19 ] 4 ноября 2003 года он добился переизбрания на второй срок, получив 9 461 голос (72,05 %) и обогнав соперников от «зелёных» и республиканцев. [ 20 ] 8 ноября 2005 года Де Блазио был переизбран на третий срок, набрав 17 554 голоса (83,44 %) и опередив республиканского и независимого кандидатов. [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Будучи депутатом, Де Блазио возглавлял Комитет Городского совета по всеобщему благосостоянию ( англ. Committee on General Welfare ), а также был членом комитетов по образованию ( англ. Committee on Education ), охране окружающей среды ( англ. Committee on Environmental Protection ), финансам ( англ. Committee on Finance ) и технологиям управления ( англ. Committee on Technology in Government ). Committee on General Welfare Committee on Education Committee on Environmental Protection Committee on Finance Committee on Technology in Government В городском совете Де Блазио добился принятия закона о предотвращении дискриминации арендаторов, использующих федеральные ваучеры жилищных субсидий, а также помог пройти закону об улучшении жилищно-коммунальных услуг для малоимущих жителей Нью-Йорка, инфицированных ВИЧ / СПИДом . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] В качестве главы комитета Городского совета по благосостояния Билл помог принятию законов о защите трансгендерных жителей Нью-Йорка, о признании однополых партнёрств , который уравнял в правах однополые и гетеросексуальные пары, [ 24 ] и о бесплатной языковой помощи для иммигрантов, не владеющих английским языком с целью облегчить им доступ к государственным услугам и программам. [ 25 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Общественный адвокат Нью-Йорка  [ править | править код ] [ править | править код ] В ноябре 2008 года Де Блазио объявил о намерении бороться за своё выдвижение на должность Общественного адвоката города Нью-Йорка от Демократической партии. Его кандидатуру поддержали газета « Нью-Йорк Таймс » [ 26 ] , 2-й Общественный адвокат Бетси Готбаум, бывший мэр Нью-Йорка Эд Коч, бывший губернатор штата Нью-Йорк Марио Куомо и преподобный Эл Шарптон (священник Американских баптистских церквей США , активист-правозащитник и телерадиоведущий). [ ] 15 сентября 2009 года Де Блазио занял первое место в первом туре праймериз Демократической партии, получив 33 % голосов. [ 27 ] 29 сентября того же года он выиграл второй тур первичных выборов, набрав 145 413 голосов (62,35 %) и победив первого в истории Общественного адвоката Нью-Йорка Марка Грина, решившего вернуться на эту должность. [ 28 ] 3 ноября 2009 года Де Блазио получил 724 629 голосов (77,56 %), победив пять соперников, среди которых был республиканец Алекс Заблоцки. [ 29 ] В должность третьего Общественного адвоката Нью-Йорка Билл вступил 1 января 2010 года . В своей инаугурационной речи он раскритиковал администрацию мэра Майкла Блумберга, в частности, за её политику в области образования и за её отношение к нуждам бездомных. [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Как общественный адвокат Де Блазио неоднократно резко критиковал политику мэра Блумберга в сфере образования. Он призывал Кэти Блэк , в то время Канцлера школ Нью-Йорка , принять участие в общественных форумах и критиковал её за то, что она не посылает своих детей учиться в общественные школы. [ 31 ] В марте 2010 года Де Блазио выступил против предложения транспортной компании Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) отменить бесплатные проездные для учащихся, утверждая, что эта мера отрицательно скажется на посещаемости школ. [ 32 ] Три месяца спустя он высказался против предложенного мэром проекта городского бюджета, которым предусматривалось сокращение расходов на службы по уходу за детьми на более чем $34 млн. [ 33 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] В июне 2010 года Де Блазио выступил против решения Управления жилищного хозяйства Нью-Йорка о сокращении количества ваучеров на жилищные субсидии для жителей Нью-Йорка с низким уровнем доходов. Через месяц решение было отменено. [ 34 ] Два месяца спустя Де Блазио запустил интернет-проект «Список худших арендодателей Нью-Йорка» ( англ. NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist ), чтобы отслеживать арендодателей, которые сдают жильё опасное для жизни. Список получил широкое освещение в СМИ . [ 35 ] [49] [ ] NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist [ ] В июне 2011 года Де Блазио предложил план по улучшению работы школ так называемого совместного размещения (несколько школ расположены в одном здании). Его исследование показало, что департамент образования нередко игнорирует мнение местных сообществ, в результате чего решения принимаются без учёта негативных последствий. Де Блазио подготовил восемь предложений по совершенствованию процесса и подключению местных сообществ к процессу принятия решений. [ 36 ] В том же месяце он также подверг критике предложение администрации города уволить более 4600 учителей, чтобы сбалансировать бюджет города. В результате Блумберг согласился сохранить финансирование школ за счёт экономии по другим статьям бюджета. [ 37 ] [ ] [ ] В сентябре 2013 года Де Блазио выступил против так называемых чартерных школ [англ.] , которые получая финансирование из бюджета, в то же время находятся в управлении у частных лиц и компаний, считая, что в центре внимания городских властей должны быть общественные школы. Он предложил прекратить политику бесплатной аренды муниципальных помещений для 183 чартерных школ города и ввести мораторий на совместное размещение чартерных и общественных школ в одном здании. В октябре 2013 года состоялся Марш в поддержку чартерных школ, в котором приняли участие почти 20 тысяч демонстрантов, протестовавших против предложения де Блазио. [ 38 ] чартерных школ [англ.] [ ] Выборы мэра  [ править | править код ] [ править | править код ] 27 января 2013 года де Блазио выдвинул свою кандидатуру на пост мэра города Нью-Йорка от Демократической партии. [ 39 ] [ ] В праймериз демократов решили участвовать девять кандидатов, в том числе такие известные политики как спикер горсовета Кристин Куинн , бывший член Палаты представителей США Энтони Винер и бывший казначей города Нью-Йорка и участник мэрских выборов 2009 года Билл Томпсон. [ 40 ] В апреле, после того как Винер вышел из борьбы, де Блазио занимал по опросам четвёртое/пятое места. [ 41 ] Несмотря на свои невысокие при начале шансы, Билл смог получить поддержку ряда влиятельных организаций и лиц. В частности, его поддержали Демократический Клуб Барака Обамы в Верхнем Манхэттене ( англ. Barack Obama Democratic Club of Upper Manhattan ), крупнейший в Нью-Йорке профсоюз, Объединение работников здравоохранения Востока ( англ. United Healthcare Workers East ), бывший губернатор Вермонта Говард Дин , конгрессмен Иветт Кларк, а также такие знаменитости как Алек Болдуин , Сара Джессика Паркер , Гарри Белафонте и Сьюзан Сарандон . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ ] [ ] Barack Obama Democratic Club of Upper Manhattan United Healthcare Workers East [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Де Блазио привлёк к себе внимание СМИ когда он и десяток других политиков, в том числе депутат городского совета Стивен Левин, были арестованы за протест против закрытия больницы Колледжа Лонг-Айленда. [ 46 ] Среди протестующих также были претенденты на выдвижение в мэры от Демократического мэра Энтони Винера и городского казначея Джона Лю, но они не были арестованы. Благодаря аресту и поддержке влиятельных организаций и лиц рейтинг де Блазио постепенно начал двигаться вверх. В середине августа он впервые вышел в лидеры опросов [ 47 ] . 3 сентября были опубликованы итоги опроса социологов университета Quinnipiac, показавшие, что уровень поддержки де Блазио вырос до своего максимального значения, 43 %. [ 48 ] [63] [ ] [ ] [ ] В ходе первичных выборов 10 сентября де Блазио получил 40,12 %, что несколько больше чем 40 %, необходимых, чтобы избежать второго тура. [ 49 ] 16 сентября Билл Томпсон, занявший второе место, снял свою кандидатуру, сославшись на малую вероятность. Этот шаг Томпсона расчистил путь для де Блазио к тому, чтобы стать кандидатом от демократов на пост мэра Нью-Йорка. [ 50 ] Уже 12 сентября де Блазио был также объявлен кандидатом Партии работающих семей ( англ. Working Families Party ). [ 51 ] [ ] [ ] Working Families Party [ ] Во время своей предвыборной кампании де Блазио объявил о намерении поднять налоги на жителей, чей заработок более $ 500 000 в год, для того, чтобы профинансировать программы дошкольного обучения и расширить программы внешкольного обучения в средних школах. [ 52 ] Он также обещал ежегодно вкладывать $ 150 млн в Городской университет Нью-Йорка, чтобы снизить плату за обучение и улучшить образовательные программы, улучшить техническое и специальное образование. [ 53 ] В сфере безопасности и предупреждения преступности де Блазио был намерен положить конец расовой дискриминации со стороны полиции, ужесточить контроль за оружием, обеспечить прозрачность и подотчётность полиции, с одновременным увеличением расходов на правоохранительные органы. [ 53 ] В области здравоохранения он планировал обеспечить незастрахованных жителей Нью-Йорка медицинским обслуживанием и открыть не менее 16 новых клиник. В экономике де Блазио собирается создавать экономические центры развития в каждом районе города, расширить программы помощи малому бизнесу, в том числе поддержки предпринимателей-иммигрантов, реформировать налоговые льготы и ликвидировать неэффективные программ, что позволит экономить $250 млн в год, а также разработать единый бюджет развития. [ 53 ] Для борьбы с безработицей он предлагает улучшить систему профессиональной подготовки и выделить субсидии на создание рабочих мест с зарплатой не ниже прожиточного минимума. В течение следующего десятилетия он обещает построить почти 200 000 единиц доступного жилья. В течение следующих пяти лет де Блазио хочет сделать высокоскоростной интернет доступным для всех домохозяйств Нью-Йорка и создать общественные Wi-Fi зоны вокруг экономических центров развития. Он планирует создать общегородскую сеть Bus Rapid Transit с более чем 20 линиями. Также де Блазио будет бороться за право города устанавливать камеры контроля скорости у школ и домов престарелых. [ 53 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Для защиты окружающей среды Билл де Блазио будет продолжать инвестировать в «зелёную энергию» и переработку мусора, а также помогать владельцам бизнесов снизить потребление энергии. Кроме того, он собирается восстановить водные пути сообщения в целях расширения экотуризма . [ 53 ] В социальной сфере де Блазио собирается настаивать на обеспечении наёмных работников оплачиваемыми больничными днями и зарплатой не ниже прожиточного минимума, а также обещал упростить процесс подачи заявки на участие в программах продовольственной помощи. Кроме того, он планирует сделать бесплатными обеды во всех общественных школах. [ 53 ] Де Блазио, став мэром, планирует работать над расширением поддержки бездомной ЛГБТ-молодёжи, помочь с получением жилья для пожилых ЛГБТ, а также обеспечить ЛГБТ Нью-Йорка доступ к общественным и частным планам страхования. Также он обещал бороться за предотвращение преследований и дискриминации женщин, в частности обеспечить равную оплату за равный труд. Кроме того, де Блазио планирует работать над облегчением доступа к жилью для женщин, ставших жертвами насилия в семье, и одиноких матерей. [ 53 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] На выборах 5 ноября 2013 года де Блазио был избран 109-м мэром Нью-Йорка [ 54 ] . Согласно результатам экзит-полов, объявленным после закрытия избирательных участков, де Блазио победил на выборах с результатом превышающим 70 % голосов. [ 55 ] [ ] [ ] Церемония принятия присяги прошла 1 января 2014 года сразу после полуночи в доме Де Блазио. В 12:00 по местному времени (21:00 по Москве) состоялась церемония инаугурации мэра. Её провёл бывший президент США Билл Клинтон , используя Библию, принадлежавшую Франклину Рузвельту [ 56 ] . [ ] Личная жизнь  [ править | править код ] [ править | править код ] Де Блазио женат.

Fra 1. januar 2014 var han borgermester i samme by, etter at han vant borgermestervalget 5. november 2013 med 73,3 % av stemmene mot republikaneren Joe Lhotas 24,3 %. Bill de Blasio ble gjenvalgt i 2017. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] Han var Demokratenes kandidat i byens borgermestervalg i 2013, etter å ha fått litt over 40 % av stemmene i primærvalget. [ 7 ] De Blasios valgkamp fikk kritikk av sittende borgermester Michael Bloomberg , som mente den var rasistisk fordi de Blasios bietniske familie har spilt en viktig rolle i valgkampen. [ 8 ] Valgkampen til de Blasio har hovedsakelig vært en anti-Bloomberg-kampanje, som særlig har vært kritisk til «stopp og kroppsvisitasjon»-programmet. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Han representerte deler av i bydelen Brooklyn i New Yorks bystyre fra 2002 til 2009. 16. mai 2019 kunngjorde han at han vil stille til primærvalgene for å bli Det demokratiske partiets presidentkandidat i 2020. [ 10 ] På grunn av manglende oppslutning trakk han kandidaturet 20. september samme år.

It is also located over the same area as a county of New York state called New York County . Although it is the smallest borough, it is the most densely populated borough and the heart of New York City. Most of the neighborhoods of Manhattan are on Manhattan Island , but the Marble Hill neighborhood is part of the mainland United States (by way of the Bronx ). Several smaller islands, including Roosevelt Island , are also part of Manhattan. The Dutch bought it from the Native Americans and called it New Amsterdam , then the English took it over and changed the name to New York. The name Manhattan comes from the Munsi language of the Lenni Lenape meaning island of many hills . Other theories say that it comes from one of three Munsi words. "Manahactanienk" meaning "place of inebriation". Other possibilities are "manahatouh" meaning "a place where wood is available for making bows and arrows" and "menatay" meaning simply "the island." [ 4 ] [ ] Manhattan is an important commercial , financial and cultural center of the United States and the world. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Most major radio, television , and telecommunications companies in the United States are based there, as well as many news, magazines , books , and other media publishers. Manhattan has many famous landmarks, tourist attractions, museums, and universities. It also has the headquarters of the United Nations . [ ] [ ] History [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Before colonization , the Lenape Indians lived in the area that is now called Manhattan. [ 7 ] In 1524, Lenape people in canoes met Giovanni da Verrazzano , the first European explorer to pass New York Harbor , although he may not have entered the harbor past the Narrows . [ 8 ] Henry Hudson , an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company , made the first map of the area. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Colonial times [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In the 1620s, the first large European colony was started in New Netherland , when the Dutch began trading fur on Governors Island . [ 7 ] In 1625, the Dutch chose Manhattan Island to build Fort Amsterdam ,  a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals. It would later be called New Amsterdam ( Dutch : Nieuw Amsterdam ). The creation of New Amsterdam was recognized as the birth of New York City . [ ] On May 24, 1626, Manhattan was bought from the Native Americans living on the island. The price was trading goods worth 60 guilders , which was worth about 24 dollars at the time. The currency calculations from the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam say that 60 guilders in the 1620s cost around $ 1000 now. [ 10 ] [ ] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant became the last Dutch Director General of the colony. New Amsterdam was considered an official city on 3 February 1653. In 1664, the British conquered New Netherland and renamed it "New York" after the English King James II , then known as Duke of York and Albany . Stuyvesant and his council made a deal with the British where New Netherlanders were promised liberties , including freedom of religion , under British rule. In August 1673, the Dutch took control of the island again, calling the city "New Orange" ( Dutch : Nieuwe Oranje ). The Dutch lost control of New Netherland forever to the English in November 1674 by treaty . American Revolution [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Manhattan was the center of many campaigns , battles and meetings during the American Revolution . In 1765, all of the colonies worked together for a unified political aim when the Stamp Act Congress (meeting) of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies was held in New York City to write The Declaration of Rights and Grievances . [ 11 ] [ ] The Sons of Liberty , a Boston based group, were part of a long-term battle with British authorities over liberty poles that were sometimes raised by the Sons of Liberty and cut down by the British. The disputes ended when the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress took power in 1775. [ 12 ] [ ] Manhattan was the center of a series of large battles in the early American Revolutionary War . [ 13 ] These battles were called the New York Campaign , where British forces and colonists fought for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey . The rebel Continental Army , led by George Washington , had to leave Manhattan after losing the Battle of Fort Washington on 16 November 1776. Shortly after, Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York in 1776. [ ] Victory gave the British control of the area. They used the city as the center for political and military activities for the rest of the war . Loyalists from elsewhere came to the city as refugees from the Rebels and to join the war. Years later, Washington came back to Manhattan with his army. On Evacuation Day , the last British occupation forces left the city on 25 November 1783. [ 14 ] On 30 April, 1789, Washington was inaugurated (officially became) the first president of the United States and took his oath of office at Federal Hall on Wall Street . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Immigration influx and Gilded Age [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In the early 19th century, Manhattan grew in population and economically. Another great fire in 1835 destroyed much of the city but it was soon rebuilt. Because of the Great Irish Famine , a lot of Irish people emigrated (left their country) to live in New York; they made up for 25% of Manhattan's population at the time. [ 17 ] Many of the Irish people lived in a part of the Lower East Side known as the Bowery or in another section called Five Points . [ ] After the Civil War , many immigrants of Italian , [ 18 ] Polish [ 19 ] and Jewish [ 20 ] backgrounds came to Manhattan and lived in tenements in a part of the city called the Lower East Side .  Over a million people lived in the area at one point. [ ] [ ] [ ] An Irish political machine called Tammany Hall was very important to New York City during the Gilded Age. [ 21 ] With the support of mostly Irish immigrants, it grew as a political machine . [ 21 ] The support helped win the election for the first Tammany mayor , Fernando Wood , in 1854. [ 21 ] Central Park , which opened to the public in 1858, became the first landscaped park in any American city and the country's first public park. [ 22 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The rate of immigration from Europe shot up after the Civil War , and New York became the most popular state for immigrants in the United States. Because of this, the French built and gave New York the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886. Soon after, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn were combined into one city . Economic downfall and rise [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In the beginning of the 20th century, many new things were built in the city, like skyscrapers and the New York City Subway . The first subway transit center, the Interborough Rapid Transit or IRT , opened to the public in 1904. [ 23 ] The installation of the Subway helped tie the new city together, as did new bridges to Brooklyn . In the 1920s, many African-Americans came to live in Manhattan during the Great Migration from the American South , and the Harlem Renaissance . [ 24 ] New York City became the most populous city (city with the most people) in the world in 1925, overtaking London , which had held the title for a century. [ ] [ ] Between World War I and World War II , reformist Fiorello La Guardia was elected as the new mayor in 1933 and took office in 1934, [ 25 ] marking the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of dominating politics in New York City. Once the city's demographics were steadier, labor unionization provided protection and affluence to the working class . Despite the Great Depression , some of the world's tallest skyscrapers of the time were built in Manhattan during the 1930s, including many Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today. The most well-known structures are Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building , and the GE Building . [ ] Following the end of World War II , a lot of veterans came home to the United States. This led to the development of private communities that were intended to be sold or rented out to returning soldiers, resulting in an economic boom. An example of one of the communities built to attract veterans looking for homes is Stuyvesant Town—Peter Cooper Village , which opened in 1947. In 1951, the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters in Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan. Population and industry began to decline in the 1960s. The Stonewall riots were a series of violent demonstrations by members of the gay community. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a graffiti -covered, crime -ridden relic of history. In 1975, the city government went bankrupt (ran out of money), and its pleas for financial help were rejected at first. On 30 October 1975, the New York Daily News reported the event with the headline as " Ford to City: Drop Dead". [ 26 ] The city received a federal loan and debt restructuring. After the economic downfall and recovery, New York State kept a close watch on New York City's economy. [ 27 ] [ ] [ ] In the 1980s, Wall Street was revived from its slump, and the city reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry. During this time, Manhattan was also at the heart of the AIDS crisis , with Greenwich Village being a major center of the epidemic . Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) were organizations that were started because of the crisis [ 28 ] Their purpose was to advocate on behalf of those AIDs victims. [ 29 ] [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Crime rates began to drop greatly in the 1990s. Murder rates were 537 in 2008 [ 30 ] compared to 2,245 in 1990. [ 31 ] The crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence had died down, and was under great control by the city. Many people who had moved out of the city came back because the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market.

It was founded on February 14, 2005, by three former PayPal employees . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Google (a search engine company) has owned and operated YouTube since 2006. [ ] [ ] YouTube's official logo features a red box like-rectangle with a white triangle facing right. People who commonly upload on YouTube are called YouTubers. YouTube awards people who reach milestones such as 100,000 subscribers and 1,000,000 subscribers, and even 10,000.000, with Play Buttons, a metal sheet with the YouTube logo and the channel name on the bottom. Videos can be rated with likes or dislikes (although the number of dislikes a video has cannot be seen by the public since the 2021 update), and viewers can subscribe to channels they like. Videos can be commented on if viewers log into their own accounts. The number of times a video has been watched, known as "views", are shown. YouTube has another app called YouTube Kids , [ 6 ] aimed at children and with less functions, made to protect children. [ ] Many different types of videos could be put onto the website, such as educational content , animations , and events. 
There were very popular YouTubers such as MrBeast and T-Series , which had the most subscribers for a YouTube Channel with over 200 million. [ 7 ] [ ] History [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] On February 14, 2005, three former workers of PayPal Steve Chen , Jawed Karim , and Chad Hurley , founded the site. In November 2006, Google bought YouTube. In 2012, an iOS app was created for YouTube. They changed their logo in 2017. Videos [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] YouTube [ 8 ] needed the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to play videos in the past. [ 9 ] However, in January 2010, YouTube started using the built-in features of web browsers (HTML5) they removed it early 2015 so people would not need to use Adobe Flash player  to watch videos. [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] All YouTube [ 11 ] users can upload 15-minute long videos. Users who have used the site for enough time and follow the rules can upload videos that are 12 hours long. A user needs to verify the account to do this, however. [ 12 ] Everyone could upload long videos when YouTube started, but in March 2006 a ten-minute video limit was put in. [ 13 ] The limit was changed to 15 minutes in July 2010. Most video formats can be uploaded to YouTube, and videos can also be uploaded from mobile phones. [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Banning [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] YouTube is blocked in many schools because it allows students to watch videos that might distract them from their lessons. At a higher level than schools (and in workplaces), some governments have blocked YouTube access to their country's public. Their reasons vary. Some countries have also banned it. These are listed below. Iran [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] On December 3, 2006, the government of Iran blocked YouTube and several other sites to stop films and music from other countries from being seen. [ 15 ] [ ] Turkey [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Turkey blocked YouTube on March 6, 2007 for letting videos that were mean or discriminating to Turks and Atatürk , the founder of modern Turkey, to be shown. Because of a "virtual war" between Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Turks on YouTube, people from each side posted videos to hurt the other. [ 16 ] The video that caused the banning said that Turks and Atatürk were gay. The video was first mentioned on Turkish CNN and the Istanbul public prosecutor sued YouTube for being mean to Turkishness. [ 17 ] The court suspended access to YouTube while waiting for the removal of the video. The ban was criticized a lot. YouTube lawyers sent proof of removal to court and users could access the website again on March 9, 2007. [ 18 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Thailand [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] During the week of March 8, 2007, YouTube was blocked in Thailand. [ 19 ] Many bloggers (people who have a "diary" online) believed the reason YouTube was blocked was because of a video of the former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 's speech on CNN . However, the government did not confirm or give reasons for the ban. YouTube was unblocked on March 10. [ ] On the night of April 3, YouTube was again blocked in Thailand. [ 20 ] The government said it was because of a video on the site that it said was "insulting" to King Bhumibol Adulyadej . [ 21 ] The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology claimed that it would unblock YouTube in a few days, after websites with references to this video are blocked instead of the entire website. [ 22 ] Communications Minister Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom said, "When they decide to withdraw the clip, we will withdraw the ban." [ 23 ] Soon after this incident the internet technology blog Mashable was banned from Thailand over the reporting of the YouTube clips in question. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Brazilian model lawsuit and banning that came after [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] YouTube is being sued by Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniela Cicarelli (better known as Ronaldo 's ex-fiancée) because she says that the site is making available a video footage made by a paparazzi (or celebrity photographer) in which she and her boyfriend are having sex on a Spanish beach. The lawsuit says that YouTube has to be blocked in Brazil until all copies of the video are removed. On Saturday, January 6, 2007, a legal injunction (command) ordered that filters be put in place to prevent users in Brazil from going to the website. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ ] [ ] The effectiveness of the measure has been questioned, since the video is not available only on YouTube, but rather has become an Internet phenomenon . On Tuesday, January 9, 2007, the same court overturned their earlier decision, ordering the filters to be taken down, even though the footage was still forbidden, but without technical support for its blockage. [ 27 ] [ ] Morocco [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] On May 25, 2007 the state-owned company Maroc Telecom blocked all access to YouTube. [ 28 ] There were no reasons given why YouTube was blocked. But the guesses are that it might have something to do with some pro-separatist group Polisario clips (Polisario is the Western Sahara independence movement) or because of some videos that criticized King Mohammed VI. This block did not concern the other two private internet-providers, Wana and Meditel. YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007 after Maroc Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was only a "technical glitch". [ 29 ] [ ] [ ] Pakistan [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] YouTube was blocked in Pakistan following a decision taken by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority on February 22, 2008 because of the number of "non-Islamic objectionable videos." Australia [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In Australia, some schools, including all secondary schools in Victoria , have YouTube blocked from student access, after fights have been posted on YouTube. China [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Currently in China , the government has blocked YouTube. For several years, it has been unblocked but since March 24, 2009 it has been blocked. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Terms of service [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] According the site's terms of service, or ToS [ 35 ] users may upload videos only if they have the permission of the copyright holder and of the people in the video. Pornography, defamation , harassment , commercials , and videos that encourage criminal conduct may not be uploaded. The uploader gives YouTube permission to give out and change the uploaded video for any purpose, and they do not have permission anymore when the uploader deletes the video from the site. Users may view videos on the site but are not allowed to save them on their computers. [ ] Localization [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] On June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was in Paris to launch the new localization system. [ 36 ] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, and a worldwide version.

Testing language [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions including Albanian , Amharic , Armenian , Burmese , Khmer , Kyrgyz , Laotian , Mongolian , Persian , and Uzbek , which do have local channel versions. Criticism [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] YouTube has been criticized for how poorly they manage user-generated content and because of how a number of their policies are considered unfair to content creators. YouTube has been criticized for not properly handling copyrighted content that is added in uploaded videos. [ 86 ] The video recommendation algorithms used in YouTube persistently promote conspiracy theories and false information, as noted by some critics. [ 87 ] There is also criticism that there are violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters in certain videos falsely claiming to be targeted to children. [ 88 ] YouTube has also been criticized for attracting pedophilic comments in videos of minors performing activities. [ 89 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Because YouTube keeps changing policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising, many content creators are concerned about these frequent changes. [ 86 ] YouTube policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising. [ 90 ] This includes videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, "controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown" (unless the content is "usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain"), [ 91 ] and videos whose user comments contain "inappropriate" content. [ 90 ] However, it is not clear what is the boundaries for what YouTube's policies specifically accept and do not accept. Some content creators also say that YouTube's policies also change too often. For example, on January 16, 2018, the requirement for a channel to be monetized is to get 4,000 hours of watchtime within the past 12 months and at least 1,000 subscribers. [ 92 ] Although YouTube's intent was to avoid monetizing videos of channels seen as controversial, people criticize that this move greatly harms smaller YouTube channels. [ 93 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] After testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos of November. citing its internal research that found users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading . While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls , others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognise clickbait or unhelpful videos, and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. Some theorised the removal of dislikes was influenced by YouTube Rewind 2018 , which was universally panned and became the most-disliked video on the platform. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as "a stupid idea", and that the reason behind the change was "not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed." Karim felt that the ability for users on a social platform to identity bad content was essential, saying, "The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform still disagrees."

People who immigrate are called immigrants. Some are illegal immigrants . Some immigrants are refugees and some ask for political asylum . If someone wants to immigrate to the United States, that person has to apply to become a legal citizen. If the person is accepted, they will receive a green card. A green card is a piece of evidence stating that the person is trying to legally stay within the country's borders. The person must keep the green card for at least five years in order to become a citizen of the United States of America. (USA-GOV pg. 1) Immigrant and emigrant both describe human migration . The same people are emigrants when they leave their own country or region, and immigrants when they arrive somewhere else. The phrases "many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century to America " and "many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century" have the same meaning.  Reasons for immigration [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] As with other changes, people go to another place for several reasons: Pull : people immigrate seeking a better life. For example, in the new country, work is easier to find, quality of life is better, etc. Push : people leave a place where life has become bad. For example, there may be no work , a war, violence , high criminality rates or other problems. Personal reasons : people go to join their family , or marry and live with their partner . Religious reasons: people may choose to migrate because of religious problems. Other people may not agree with their beliefs or morals and it could leave them feeling persecuted . (Christina Nunez, 2014, par. 3) Resource reasons: The place the person is leaving in may be environmentally discomforting. There could be a lack of food and water sources. It could potentially be too cold/hot and the person may not have the correct resources to make them comfortable, such as a house, certain types of clothing, or stores to receive the items they need. (Christina Nunez, 2014, par. 4) Difficulty of immigration [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Immigration has always been difficult. When people immigrate, they leave behind their friends, families, and culture . They also have to sell what they have, like a house, farm , or anything else too big to bring. Immigrating is also difficult because of the strict Immigration laws and qualifications within each country. It is hard to become a legal citizen of a country. It takes time (about 5 years in the US) and a lot of patience to become legally apart of a country. (USA-GOV pg. 1) Learning different languages in order to feel comfortable in a country is also extremely difficult for some people They might not have the opportunity to go a to school and learn certain things. Not knowing or beginning to learn the language of a country the person immigrates to can be very uncomfortable at first. This is because communication is needed within our everyday lives, such as at work, in grocery stores, restaurants, and just everyday life. (Global Citizen, 2014, par. 3) Travelling can also be very expensive. Many immigrants have to use all their money to pay fees or plane tickets. Once immigrants arrive in the new countries, they can face many difficulties. They may have to get a job, find a house, and learn a new language. Immigrants can also be victims of racism .

[ ] Taust [ muuda | muuda lähteteksti ] [ muuda | muuda lähteteksti ] Bill de Blasiona tuntud poliitik sai sündides nime Warren Wilhelm, Jr. Ta alkoholiprobleemidega sõjaveteranist isa jättis pere maha ja Bill kasvas üles oma emapoolse (de Blasio) suguvõsa keskel. [ 2 ] 1983 vahetas ta oma nime Warren de Blasio-Wilhelmiks. Pereringis kasutati tema kohta nime "Bill" või "Billy" ja 2002. aastal vahetas ta ära ka eesnime ja kasutab nüüd nime Bill de Blasio. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio sai bakalaureusekraadi New Yorgi Ülikoolist , kus tegeles urbanistikaga . Rahvusvaheliste suhete magistrikraadi sai ta Columbia Ülikoolist .

( Kuidas ja millal see märkus eemaldada? )  Palun aita selle artikli sisu ajakohastada. ( Kuidas ja millal see märkus eemaldada? )  Pärast ülikooli töötas ta sotsiaalse õigluse nimel tegutsevas ühingus Quixote Center. Ühingu töötajana viibis ta Nicaragua revolutsiooni ajal kümme päeva Nicaraguas ning jagas seal toitu ja ravimeid. Erinevalt Reagani administratsiooni poliitikast toetas de Blasio sandinistide valitsust. Nicaraguast naasnuna kolis ta New Yorki ja töötas ühes Kesk-Ameerika maade tervishoiutingimuste parandamisega tegelevas mittetulundusühingus . [ 4 ] [ ] Munitsipaalpoliitikaga puutus de Blasio esimest korda kokku David Dinkinsi 1989. aasta linnapeakampaania ajal vabatahtlikuna. [ 5 ] Pärast seda töötas ta mitmel New Yorgi linnaelu korraldaval ametikohal. [ ] Aastail 2001–2009 kuulus ta linnavolikokku. Ta seisis eluasemepoliitika valdkonnas üürnike õiguste eest [ 6 ] ja võitles ta seksuaalvähemuste diskrimineerimise vastu. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] Aastail 2010–2013 oli de Blasio New Yorgi ombudsman (New York City Public Advocate). Ta kritiseeris korduvalt tolleaegse linnapea Michael Bloombergi hariduspoliitikat ja seisis vastu lastehoiu valdkonna kärbetele. [ 8 ] Samuti seadis ta sisse veebipõhise "New Yorgi halvimate üürileandjate nimekirja" ("NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist"), kus toodi välja üürileandjad, kes ei remontinud ohtlikus seisukorras eluasemeid. [ 9 ] [ ] [ ] Ta oli New Yorgi 109. linnapea. 5. novembril 2013 toimunud valimistel kogus ta 72,2% häältest ja sai vabariiklasest vastaskandidaadi üle suure võidu. [ 10 ] De Blasio on esimene demokraadist New Yorgi linnapea pärast 1989. aastal ametisse valitud David Dinkinsit (1993–2013 juhtisid linna vabariiklased Rudy Giuliani ja Michael Bloomberg ). Ta vannutati ametisse 1. jaanuaril 2014. Oma ametisseastumiskõnes lubas ta linnapeana pöörata tähelepanu majanduslikule ja sotsiaalsele ebavõrdsusele. [ 11 ] Ta on öelnud, et tahab ära kaotada Central Parki hobukaarikud, kuna peab neid ebainimlikeks. [ 12 ] Ta soovis võimaldada kõigile New Yorgi elanikele ligipääsu avalikult rahastatud lastesõimedele. [ 13 ] Selle tarbeks tahtis ta tõsta üle 500 000-dollarise aastasissetulekuga newyorklaste maksukoormust. [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Isiklikku [ muuda | muuda lähteteksti ] [ muuda | muuda lähteteksti ] De Blasio tutvus oma aktivistist ja poetessist tulevase abikaasa Chirlane McCrayga linnapea David Dinkinsi administratsioonis töötades. [ 15 ] Nad elavad Brooklynis ja neil on kaks last, kes mõlemad on saanud hariduse New Yorgi avaliku sektori koolides.

Former vice president Joe Biden and U.S. senator Kamala Harris defeated incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and incumbent Vice President Mike Pence on the Democratic Party ticket. Voters selected presidential electors who then voted on December 14, 2020 [ 6 ] to either elect a new president and vice president or re-elect the incumbents . On November 7, Biden won the election and became the president-elect of the United States . [ ] Donald Trump , the 45th president, started a campaign to be president for four more years in the Republican primaries . Several state Republican Party organizations cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy . [ 7 ] He became the presumptive nominee in March 2020. [ ] Twenty-seven major candidates started campaigns for the Democratic nomination . This was the largest number of candidates for any political party in modern-day American politics. In April 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee after beating Senator Bernie Sanders . In August 2020, Biden picked U.S. Senator and former 2020 candidate Kamala Harris as his running mate. [ 8 ] [ ] Some issues of the election included the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , which killed over 220,000 Americans at the time of the election, protests in reaction to the murder of George Floyd and other black Americans , the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett , and the Affordable Care Act , with Biden wanting to protect and expand it and Trump pushing for ending it. [ 9 ] [ ] After the election, Donald Trump refused to accept that he lost and filed over 40 lawsuits against states and politicians trying to change the election results . The lawsuits said that the election was not fair. Almost all of the lawsuits failed in court because Trump could not prove what he said. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In some states, the votes were counted again, which still showed that Biden won. [ 12 ] After the electors voted for Biden on December 14, Trump tried other ways to overturn the election results. [ 13 ] When the electoral votes were counted in Congress on January 6-7, some Republicans voted not to count votes from certain states. [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021, at midday when he took the oath of office . Background [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The 2020 U.S. presidential election was the first time all members of the millennial generation were able to vote. The age group of people in the 18 to the 45-year-old area was 40 percent of those able to vote in 2020. The United States House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on December 18, 2019, making him the third president in American history to be impeached. [ 15 ] He was acquitted by the United States Senate on February 5, 2020. [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] Mail voting [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] More people voted by mail in the United States, with 25% of voters nationwide mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 means there has been an increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of large groups at polling places. [ 17 ] For the 2020 election, a state-by-state analysis found that 76% of Americans are eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020—more than double the number in 2016. [ 18 ] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots. [ 19 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] President Trump was critical of voting by mail saying that it would make it easier for voter fraud to happen. [ 20 ] Many people dropped their votes in voting boxes in their voting places instead of going to the polls.

In early December, only a quarter of Republicans believed that Biden was the real winner of the election. [ 143 ] Trump did not accept Biden's win until January 7. [ 144 ] [ ] [ ] Lawsuits [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Trump and his lawyers filed over 40 lawsuits after the election, in Arizona , Georgia , Michigan , Nevada , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin . Biden won each of these states by a small number of votes. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Some lawsuits said that states should not allow more time to collect ballots in the mail, and some said that voters should not be allowed to put ballots in drop boxes. Other lawsuits said that election workers did not make sure all signatures were correct. [ 11 ] Judges rejected most of the lawsuits because they did not have evidence . The Trump campaign only won one lawsuit. [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Many of the lawsuits asked states to remove thousands of votes, and others asked for the states to ignore the results of the election. [ 11 ] In December, the Attorney General of Texas filed a lawsuit (Texas v. Pennsylvania) against Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, and Wisconsin, in front of the Supreme Court. It asked the court to stop these states from certifying their votes. Over 100 Republicans in the House of Representatives supported it. However, the Supreme Court rejected it and said Texas did not have standing . [ 145 ] [ ] [ ] Trump campaign tries to overturn the election [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] After lawsuits failed, Trump said many times that the election was "rigged". From November to January, Trump and his lawyers made phone calls to many election officials, and told them that they should not certify the votes for Biden. In the calls, they said many things which were false . [ 146 ] On January 2, Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State and told him that Georgia (where Biden was the winner) should find more votes for Trump, so Trump could win. [ 147 ] [ ] [ ] Electoral college count [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] On January 6-7, members of Congress counted the votes of the Electoral College . Some Republican members of Congress signed objections to the votes (they thought the votes should not be counted) from Arizona and Pennsylvania. By the end, seven Republican senators and 138 Republican representatives voted not to count these votes. [ 148 ] Half of senators and half of the representatives must vote to throw out electoral votes. Congress has never thrown out electoral votes. [ 149 ] [ ] [ ] While Congress was counting the votes on January 6, Far-right terrorists broke into the US Capitol building in protest . Members of Congress hid for hours until police forced the protestors to leave.

Mai 1961 als Warren Wilhelm, Jr. in New York City , New York ) ist ein US-amerikanischer Politiker und ehemaliger Bürgermeister von New York . Er ist Mitglied der Demokratischen Partei und gilt als Vertreter des linken Flügels . [ 1 ] Er war von 2014 bis 2021 Bürgermeister von New York City. Zuvor war er Mitglied im Stadtrat von New York und vom 1. Januar 2010 bis zum 31. Dezember 2013 Public Advocate , so etwas wie der Ombudsmann der Stadt. [ ] Bei der Bürgermeisterwahl am 5. November 2013 setzte sich de Blasio in einem als erdrutschartig beschriebenen Sieg mit über 73 % der Stimmen gegen den Republikaner Joe Lhota durch. [ 2 ] Er löste am 1. Januar 2014 den zuletzt parteilosen Michael Bloomberg ab, der nach zwölf Amtsjahren nicht mehr kandidieren durfte. 2017 wurde er wiedergewählt. [ ] Vom 16. Mai 2019 bis zum 20. September 2019 kandidierte er für die Präsidentschaftswahl 2020 . [ 3 ] [ ] Leben [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Kindheit und Jugend [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] De Blasio wurde 1961 als Warren Wilhelm, Jr. im New Yorker Stadtbezirk Manhattan als Sohn von Maria (geborene de Blasio) und Warren Wilhelm geboren. Sein Vater hatte deutsche Vorfahren , seine Großeltern mütterlicherseits, Giovanni und Anna, waren italienische Einwanderer aus der kampanischen Kleinstadt Sant’Agata de’ Goti . [ 4 ] [ ] Seine Kindheit verbrachte er in Cambridge im US-Bundesstaat Massachusetts . Nach der Scheidung seiner Eltern wuchs er bei seiner Mutter auf. Sein Vater war Alkoholiker und litt als Kriegsveteran der U.S. Army unter den physischen und psychischen Folgen seines Einsatzes im Pazifikkrieg , in dem er auch an der Schlacht von Okinawa beteiligt war. Er war unheilbar an Lungenkrebs erkrankt und beging 1979 Suizid . [ 5 ] [ ] Ausbildung und frühe Karriere  [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] De Blasio erwarb einen Bachelor of Arts an der New York University . Als Stipendiat der Harry-S.-Truman-Stiftung von 1981 erwarb er seinen Master of International Affairs an der School of International and Public Affairs der Columbia University . 1983 änderte er rechtswirksam seinen Namen in Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm . Ab 1990 trat er öffentlich in Erscheinung und benutzte fortan den Namen Bill de Blasio , weil er in seinem früheren Leben „Bill“ oder „Billy“ genannt worden war. Eine erneute rechtswirksame Änderung seines Namens nahm er allerdings erst 2002 vor, als die Diskrepanz während einer Wahl bemerkt wurde. Ab 1984 arbeitete de Blasio für das New York City Department of Juvenile Justice . Ab 1987 wirkte er als politischer Organisator für das Quixote Center in Maryland , für das er 1988 nach Nicaragua reiste, um dort während der Revolution zehn Tage lang Lebens- und Arzneimittel zu verteilen. De Blasio war ein engagierter Unterstützer der damaligen Sandinista -Regierung, die Gegner der Reagan -Regierung war. Er bezeichnete sich zu jener Zeit als „demokratischen Sozialisten“. [ 6 ] Nach seiner Rückkehr aus Nicaragua zog de Blasio nach New York, wo er für eine gemeinnützige Organisation arbeitete, welche zum Ziel hatte, die medizinische Versorgung in Mittelamerika zu verbessern. In seiner Freizeit engagierte er sich weiterhin für die Sandinistas. [ ] Politische Karriere [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Sein Eintritt in die New Yorker Politik erfolgte 1989 während der Kampagne des Demokraten David Dinkins für das Amt des Bürgermeisters. Nach der Kampagne arbeitete de Blasio als Assistent im Rathaus. 1997 wurde er Regionaldirektor für das Ministerium für Wohnungsbau und Stadtentwicklung unter Präsident Bill Clinton . Als höchstrangiger Beamter des Ministeriums in der Tri-State Region erhöhte er die Bundeszuschüsse für erschwingliche und Senioren-Wohnungen. Im Jahr 2000 wurde er Wahlkampfmanager von Hillary Clinton für deren erfolgreiche Bewerbung um einen Senatssitz . New York City Council [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Zwischen 2001 und 2005 bewarb sich de Blasio dreimal erfolgreich als Vertreter des 39. Bezirks im New York City Council . Im Stadtrat wirkte er in den Ausschüssen für Allgemeine Fürsorge (Vorsitz), Erziehung, Umweltschutz, Finanzen und Technologie mit. Während seiner Amtszeit verabschiedete er Gesetze, welche die Position von Mietern mit Wohngutscheinen gegenüber Vermietern und die Position von HIV -Infizierten bei der Wohnungssuche verbessern, die Diskriminierung von trans Menschen und gleichgeschlechtlichen Partnerschaften verringern sowie die sprachliche Unterstützung von Einwanderern bei der Antragstellung ermöglichen sollten. New York City Public Advocate [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Im November 2008 kündigte de Blasio seine Kandidatur für das Amt des New York City Public Advocate an. Mit Unterstützung der New York Times und verschiedener bekannter Persönlichkeiten gewann er die Wahl. Nach seiner Amtseinführung am 1. Januar 2010 kritisierte er Bürgermeister Michael Bloomberg , zu wenig für die Bildungs-, Familien- und Sozialpolitik zu tun. Zu den konkreten Kritikpunkten gehörte die Abschaffung freier U-Bahn-Tickets für Schüler, Budgetkürzung bei der Kinderbetreuung und der Co-location-Streit um die gemeinsame Unterbringung von Charter- und öffentlichen Regelschulen. Gegen die Pläne des Bürgermeisters, den Ausgleich des städtischen Haushaltes durch die Entlassung von 4600 Lehrern zu erreichen, organisierte de Blasio starken Widerstand und erreichte, dass Einsparungen an anderen Stellen vorgenommen wurden. 2010 formulierte er seine Opposition gegen eine Entscheidung der Wohnungsbehörde ( New York City Housing Authority ), die Anzahl bestimmter Wohngutscheine für Bürger mit niedrigem Einkommen zu reduzieren. Er erreichte, dass diese Entscheidung rückgängig gemacht wurde. Ein anderer Ansatzpunkt zur Verbesserung der Situation für Mieter war der Start der Vermieter-Beobachtungsliste NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist , auf der solche Vermieter aufgelistet werden, welche die Behebung von gefährlichen Wohnbedingungen vernachlässigen. Wahl zum Bürgermeister  [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Während seiner Kandidatur für das Amt des Bürgermeisters kündigte de Blasio Steuererhöhungen für Bürger mit einem Einkommen von mehr als 500.000 US-Dollar an, um davon vorschulische und schulische Programme zu finanzieren. Er wolle außerdem jährlich 150 Millionen US-Dollar in die City University of New York investieren, um die Studiengebühren zu senken und die Studienabschlüsse zu verbessern. Gegenüber Charter-Schulen und deren Finanzierung kündigte er eine kritische Haltung an und machte deutlich, dass sein Fokus auf den traditionellen öffentlichen Schulen liegen werde. Am 27. Januar 2013 kündigte de Blasio seine Kandidatur für das Amt des Bürgermeisters von New York City an. Er erhielt die Unterstützung von vielen demokratischen Clubs sowie der größten Gewerkschaft in New York City, der Service Employees International Union . Auch Filmschauspieler wie Alec Baldwin und Susan Sarandon sowie Harry Belafonte sicherten ihm ihre Unterstützung zu. Die Aufmerksamkeit der Medien gewann er, als er und andere prominente Demokraten bei einer Protestdemonstration gegen die Schließung des Long Island College Hospitals vorübergehend wegen Ruhestörung festgenommen wurden. Am 5. November 2013 konnte de Blasio die Bürgermeisterwahl in einem erdrutschartigen Sieg für sich entscheiden. Mit 73 % der Stimmen, in Brooklyn und der Bronx sogar mit über 80 % der Stimmen, ließ er seinen republikanischen Konkurrenten Joe Lhota , der 24 % erzielte, weit hinter sich. Nach 20 Jahren hatte New York City damit wieder einen demokratischen Bürgermeister. [ 7 ] Bei seiner Siegesrede in seinem Heimatbezirk Brooklyn sagte er vor 2000 Anhängern: „Liebe New Yorker: Heute habt Ihr Euch laut und deutlich für einen Richtungswechsel in unserer Stadt ausgesprochen, vereint in dem Glauben, dass unsere Stadt keinen New Yorker zurücklassen darf“ und kündigte an, die wachsende Ungleichheit in der Stadt zu bekämpfen. [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] Nachfolgerin im Amt des Public Advocate wurde die demokratische Bürgerrechtsanwältin Letitia James (sie erhielt bei der gleichzeitig abgehaltenen Wahl über 80 % der Stimmen, ohne Gegenkandidaten), die de Blasio während des Primary -Wahlkampfes einen „engen Freund“ nannte. [ 9 ] [ ] Wiederwahl [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] Am 7. November 2017 wurde de Blasio mit rund 65 Prozent der Stimmen für weitere vier Jahre gewählt, Gegenkandidatin war die Republikanerin Nicole Malliotakis . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Nach dem Ende seiner Amtszeit trat er nicht mehr zur Wiederwahl an. [ 12 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Privates [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] [ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ] De Blasio lebt mit seiner Frau Chirlane McCray und den gemeinsamen Kindern Dante und Chiara in Park Slope , Brooklyn . [ 13 ] De Blasio kündigte an, nach seinem Amtsantritt aus logistischen und sicherheitsrelevanten Gründen mit der Familie ins Gracie Mansion umzuziehen. [ 14 ] Beide Kinder besuchten öffentliche Schulen.

United States of America house .gov house .gov Rules of the House of Representatives The United States House of Representatives is a part of the United States (U.S.) Congress . Congress is the legislature of the U. S. government and makes federal laws . The other part of Congress is the U. S. Senate . There are maximum 435 members in the United States House of Representatives. These members are called U. S. Representatives or just representatives . All representatives are elected every two years. Every 10 years, the United States Census Bureau counts the population of the United States. States gain or lose Representatives based on the count. The House of Representatives is in one of the two wings in the U.S. Capitol building. The other wing is for the Senate. Sometimes the House of Representatives is informally called the House . The chairman/ chairperson in the U.S. House of Representatives is called the Speaker of the House . According to the U.S. Constitution , all bills about raising revenue, which includes taxes , must start in the House of Representatives. Also, only the House of Representatives has the power to impeach certain officials, such as the president or federal judges . According to the U.S. Constitution , the House of Representatives can kick out, or impeach, one of its representatives by a vote of at least two-thirds of its members. Members [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Every state has members of the House. The Constitution says every state must have at least one, but almost all states have more. The number is based on how many people live in that state. There are 435 total people who are members of the House of Representatives. Each member serves for 2 years (one term), but they can serve for more if they are elected again. Elections happen every 2 years, and half of them take place on the same day as elections for the President. Those take place every 4 years. They are usually elected with Plurality Voting , but states can choose the method and some states choose other ones. After each election, Congress has a period of time called a term. These last for 2 years. There are 2 groups of members, also called Political Parties. These groups aren't just in the House, though, they are also big in the Senate, Presidency, State governments, and more. The groups are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . In the infobox to the right is a chart showing what party the members are a part of. Blue is the Democrats, and Red is the Republicans. Speaker of the House [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] At the beginning of every term, the House members vote on a leader. [ 1 ] This leader is called the Speaker of the House. They control the schedule of when the members speak.

[ 20 ] Politics of the United States Political parties [ ] The Democratic Party , also known as the Democrats , is one of the two biggest political parties in the United States . Since the mid-1850's, the party's main opponent has been the Republican Party . Both political parties have controlled American politics ever since. Overview [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The party sits at the center to center-left of the American political spectrum, with the Republican Party being positioned to their right . Every four years, the party holds a National Convention where they agree on their candidate for president.  The Democratic National Committee coordinates most of the activities of the Democratic Party in all 50 United States. Since Andrew Jackson 's inauguration in 1829, there have been 16 Democratic presidents. The most recent is Joe Biden who took office as the 46th president of the United States in January 2021. The Democratic Party represents a broad spectrum of liberal and left-wing ideologies, including but not limited to classical liberalism, social democracy, progressivism, and social modern liberalism. [ source? ] source? Philosophy [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Democrats, also sometimes called the left, liberals or progressives make up one of the two main political parties in the United States. A mostly Democratic state is sometimes called a blue state . This comes from the party’s main color, which is blue , referring to a state supporting "blue" candidates. Role of government [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Democrats believe in a strong government with social assistance programs to help members of society. They prefer diplomatic solutions to conflicts , and take generally multilateralist views on trade, believing that trade must be free, but fair to protect American workers, consumers, local communities, and the environment. Some Democrats are economic centrists . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ ] [ ] Social issues [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Socially, most Democrats believe in sociocultural liberalism, taking pro-immigration, pro-marriage equality, and pro-choice views. [ 23 ] [ ] Beliefs [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] Currently, the Democratic Party is identified by progressivism , liberalism, and left-wing policies . Not all Democrats hold the same beliefs, but generally these are the things many Democrats support: Progressive income tax Higher corporate taxes and recapturing income from overseas profits Spending on business, education, infrastructure and clean energy Expanding spending on government programs Ending the death penalty Expanding rights to abortion Gun regulations to prevent citizens from hurting themselves and others with firearms Support same-sex marriage Universal healthcare Declare Washington D.C. an official state Helping students go to college or university for free without having to pay back the government Believe in allowing undocumented immigrants to work for their U.S Citizenship in the U.S. to stay, pay taxes, and oppose mass deportation Most support for Democrats comes from states in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and the Pacific Coast, as well as from the state of Hawaii . Symbols [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The symbol of the Democratic Party is the donkey . [ 24 ] Since the election of 2000, the color blue has become a symbol for Democrats. [ 25 ] [ ] [ ] Historically, Thomas Jefferson , whom the party claims as its founder, has been often seen as symbols of the Democratic Party, particularly emphasized in the annual celebrations of Jefferson Day Dinners held since the days of Andrew Jackson. As such, the Democratic Party is also often referred to as the “Party of Jefferson.” [ 26 ] [ ] List of Democratic presidents [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] 7 Andrew Jackson (1767–1845)   Tennessee March 4, 1829 March 4, 1837 8 years, 0 days 8 Martin Van Buren (1782–1862)   New York March 4, 1837 March 4, 1841 4 years, 0 days 11 James K.

Είναι μέλος του Δημοκρατικού Κόμματος . Από το 2010 έως το 2013, υπηρέτησε ως Δημόσιος Συνήγορος της Νέας Υόρκης , δεύτερη σημαντικότερη θέση στην τοπική αυτοδιοίκηση της πόλης, μετά από εκείνη του Δημάρχου. Επίσης, έχει υπηρετήσει και ως Μέλος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου της Νέας Υόρκης από το 39ο διαμέρισμα από το 2002 έως το 2009. [ 1 ] [ ] Βιογραφία  [ Επεξεργασία | επεξεργασία κώδικα ] [ Επεξεργασία | επεξεργασία κώδικα ] Ο Ντε Μπλάζιο, γεννήθηκε (ως Ουόρεν Βίλχεμ τζούνιορ) το 1961 στο Μανχάταν και μεγάλωσε κυρίως στο Κέιμπριτζ της Μασαχουσέτης . Έχει καταγωγή από τη Νικαράγουα . Σπούδασε Αστικές Σπουδές και Δημόσιες Υποθέσεις στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Νέας Υόρκης και έκανε μεταπτυχιακές σπουδές στη Νομική από το Πανεπιστήμιο Κολούμπια . Μετέπειτα, ξεκίνησε την πολιτική του καριέρα. Για ένα σύντομο διάστημα, υπήρξε ο επικεφαλής της προεκλογικής εκστρατείας για τον Τσάρλς Ρανχέλ και τη Χίλαρι Κλίντον . Ο Ντε Μπλάζιο ξεκίνησε την καριέρα του ως εκλεγμένος αξιωματούχος στο Δημοτικό Συμβούλιο της Νέας Υόρκης , εκπροσωπώντας την 39η περιφέρεια του Μπρούκλιν από το 2002 έως το 2009. Μετά από τη θητεία του ως Δημόσιος Συνήγορος, εξελέγη Δήμαρχος της Νέας Υόρκης το 2013 και επανεξελέγη το 2017. [ 2 ] [ ] Ανάμεσα στις πολιτικές πρωτοβουλίες του Ντε Μπλάζιο περιλαμβάνονται στρατηγικές αποκλιμάκωσης για σώματα ασφαλείας, μείωση διώξεων για κατόχους κάνναβης, εφαρμογή καμερών σε αστυνομικούς υπαλλήλους και ο τερματισμός του προγράμματος παρακολούθησης των μουσουλμάνων κατοίκων που είχε ξεκινήσει μετά την 11η Σεπτεμβρίου 2011 . Στην πρώτη του θητεία, εξασφάλισε δωρεάν βρεφονηπιακούς σταθμούς για όλους όσους επιθυμούσαν στην Πόλη της Νέας Υόρκης. Ο Ντε Μπλάζιο επέστησε την προσοχή του σε αυτό που αποκαλείται «έντονη οικονομική ανισότητα», την οποία χαρακτήρισε ως «ιστορία δύο πόλεων» κατά την πρώτη του εκστρατεία. Υποστήριξε κοινωνικά φιλελεύθερες και προοδευτικές πολιτικές, όσον αφορά την οικονομία της πόλης, τον πολεοδομικό σχεδιασμό, τη δημόσια εκπαίδευση, τις αστυνομικές σχέσεις και τις ιδιωτικοποιήσεις. Ο Ντε Μπλάζιο έθεσε υποψηφιότητα για την απόκτηση του «χρίσματος» των Δημοκρατικών για τις προεδρικές εκλογές του 2020 . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Αφού κατέγραψε σχετικά χαμηλά ποσοστά στις δημοσκόπησης και δεν προκρίθηκε στον τρίτο γύρο των πρωτοβάθμιων συζητήσεων, ανέστειλε την εκστρατεία του στις 20 Σεπτεμβρίου 2019 και υποστήριξε τον Μπέρνι Σάντερς πέντε μήνες αργότερα. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Η θητεία του ως Δήμαρχος της Νέας Υόρκης , ολοκληρώθηκε την 1η Ιανουαρίου 2022.

Our Terms of Use Our Terms of Use Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ("we" or "us" or "Foundation"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge. To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page ) (hereby referred to as "Projects") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity. We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use"). Overview These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as "Project Websites") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition). You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain. Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety. For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content.   1. Our Services The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here . However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as "Application Programming Interface" or "APIs"), and mobile applications. As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host , technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users: We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws.   2. Privacy Policy We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy , so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.   3. Content We Host You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites.   4. Refraining from Certain Activities The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ("UCoC"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host. Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include: Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC; Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users; Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy. Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content); Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors. Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America; Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others; Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and Engaging in fraud. Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law. Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material; Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law. Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users; Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community; Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website; Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose; Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met: such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks; such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work); you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.     You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways: a statement on your user page, a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions. In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service. Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled "Paid Contributions Without Disclosure") when contributing to that particular Project. We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy . If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action. Marketing Company Mediations Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies . Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding "Med-Arb" (a "Marketing Company Mediation") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use.   5. Password Security You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party.   6. Trademarks Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy .   7. Licensing of Content To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it. You agree to the following licensing requirements: Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Reusers may comply with either license or both. The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature.

Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons . You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL. You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.  Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy , and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons.  No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.  Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.  Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s). When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature). When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available. With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.   8. DMCA Compliance The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services. However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legal wikimedia org or snail mail our designated agent .     Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page . Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at info wikimedia org .       9. Third-party Websites and Resources You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.   10. Management of Websites The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly . However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community. Each Project will usually provide "Help" or "Contact" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to info wikimedia org or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page . Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands.     If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to: Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request; Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests; Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use; Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles; Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public. Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ("Denial of Service") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request . In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies. The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition. Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy . In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures. The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use. If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal .  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages. We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures.   11. Resolutions and Project Policies The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.   12. API Terms We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy , the Robot Policy , and the API:Etiquette (collectively, "API Documentation"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.   13. Termination Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18.   14. Disputes and Jurisdiction 14. Disputes and Jurisdiction We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use. To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred). Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally. You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services. Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed "prevailing" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted. If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section.   15. Disclaimers 15. Disclaimers Highlighted for emphasis At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure. We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.   16. Limitation on Liability 16. Limitation on Liability Highlighted for emphasis   17. Modifications to these Terms of Use Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice. Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l . However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.   18. Other Terms These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting "under the authority of" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control. You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites. If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision. You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. Thank You!  We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal. These Terms of Use went into effect on June 7, 2023.

Expand By Erin Durkin and Jillian Jorgensen UPDATED: April 7, 2018 at 9:15 AM EDT Mayor de Blasio was sworn in Monday by a bundled-up Sen. Bernie Sanders at a stripped-down affair at City Hall — where he said he’d work to make New York a safer, more affordable and inclusive place in his second term. “We have a responsibility, every one of us, to ensure that New York remains a beacon to our nation and the world,” de Blasio said. Hizzoner stood before a much smaller crowd than four years ago on an achingly cold afternoon, kicking off a second and final term in which many expect he will focus increasingly on national issues. The selection of Sanders, a Vermont senator and popular leader of the Democratic party’s left wing, did little to dial down those expectations, as the senator praised the mayor as a foil to President Trump. “In this city, the largest city of our country, the people of New York under Bill de Blasio have chosen to move government in a very different direction than what we’re seeing in Washington,” said Sanders, a Brooklyn native. He praised de Blasio for helping working people rather than billionaires, for launching universal pre-K, mental health programs and protecting immigrants. “The bottom line is that what Mayor de Blasio and his administration understand is that in this country, in the home of Ellis Island, our job is to bring people together with love and compassion and to end the divisions and the attacks,” Sanders said. De Blasio said he’d work to make New York a safer, more affordable and inclusive place in his second term. Absent were President Bill Clinton, who swore de Blasio in in 2014, and Hillary Clinton, whom the mayor endorsed over Sanders — perhaps a sign of de Blasio’s strained relationship with them after stalling on his endorsement, the shifting leftward tide of the Democratic party or of both. Also absent from the dais was Gov. Cuomo, who has feuded with de Blasio and instead attended the inauguration of Nassau County Executive Laura Curran, who he swore in. Sen. Chuck Schumer managed to attend both, showing up about an hour into de Blasio’s fete. In a prominent spot on the City Hall stage was Cynthia Nixon, the actress and longtime de Blasio supporter who is mulling a 2018 gubernatorial primary bid against Cuomo. City Hall estimated that about 950 people attended; in 2014, it was about 5,000. De Blasio arrived without the fanfare of 2014, when he and his wife Chirlane McCray and children Chiara and Dante emerged from a nearby subway stop — though this year the four did blow choreographed kisses from the stage. On a frigid day that Sanders joked was “warm and pleasant” by “Vermont standards” — Hizzoner promised to keep his speech short. “I can do a very brief speech if you prefer,” he said, to cheers. “The people have spoken… You are the most distinguished frozen group of people I have ever spoken before.” He recounted the successes of his first term — a record-low number of murders last year in particular, which came as he sought to improve relationships between police and communities. In addition to being the safest big city in America, de Blasio said, “I want us to be the fairest big city in America.” And he returned to the slogan of his reelection bid, “This is your city.” Mayor de Blasio (right) is sworn in by Sen. Bernie Sanders at City Hall on Jan. 1. “It is a reminder that the true owners of this beloved place are not the big landlords and developers, not the titans of Wall Street and the 1%,” he promised. And he contrasted that with policies emanating from Washington — recounting Abraham Lincoln’s promise that a house divided against itself cannot stand. “We in our city refuse to be dragged down to a place we know is beneath us. We know that the gaudy celebration of discrimination based on faith or color or nationality is simply unAmerican. It is a violation of who we are,” de Blasio said. “We know the overt and gleeful prejudice that is suddenly in vogue spits in the face of all that has made our city great.” “And we will not be passive in the face of regression. We will not ignore or deny the threat,” he said. “We will confront it head on. To do anything less would be an affront to our very identity as New Yorkers.” Despite references to disagreements with Washington, the tone of the affair was another marked difference from 2014 — when the Sanitation chaplain Rev. Fred Lucas called New York a plantation in his invocation and Mayor Bloomberg (who did not attend this year) sat stone-faced. This year, even as pols impugned Washington’s policies, they focused more on the city’s own efforts to counter-act them, and invocations and benedictions focused more on bringing grace and guidance to the city. Sanders praised de Blasio for helping working people rather than billionaires, for launching universal pre-K, mental health programs and protecting immigrants. Still, there were hints of politics — particularly in speeches from the two other elected officials sworn in, both considered contenders for the next mayor: Controller Scott Stringer and Public Advocate Letitia James, whose speech went longer than de Blasio’s. Stringer, like the mayor, railed against the idea of an unaffordable city — and noted the challenges that the mayor has yet to overcome. “But amidst all this success, sobering challenges remain. Tonight, in subzero conditions, more than 62,000 New Yorkers will sleep in homeless shelters,” Stringer said. “24,000 of them are children. Rents have increased 33% over the last 10 years, while wages grew less than half that rate. More New Yorkers live in poverty than there are people in Philadelphia or Phoenix.” James, who offered a speech twice as long as Stringer’s and about the same length as the mayor’s, focused mainly on her office’s accomplishments — but she called attention to the scandal surrounding lead paint in the city’s public housing developments. De Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray wave after the mayor took the oath of office on Jan. 1. “We must not only create and preserve more affordable housing, but ensure that ‘affordable’ truly means affordable for all,” she said. “But we also must ensure that the housing that our city provides and maintains is safe and free of dangerous lead that can strip our children of their futures.” In his remarks, de Blasio teased out the increased tensions expected between the three Democrats as he becomes a lame duck and they become mayoral contenders. “I guarantee you in the next four years we’re going to agree on everything,” he cracked.

Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Reuters Bill de Blasio This article is more than 5 years old Bill de Blasio announces 2020 presidential bid This article is more than 5 years old New York mayor, who traveled to early primary states such as Iowa, says he is running ‘because it’s time we put working people first’ Erin Durkin in New York and agencies Thu 16 May 2019 06.45 EDT Last modified on Tue 15 Dec 2020 09.36 EST Share New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio , has jumped into the 2020 presidential race, joining at least 21 other declared Democratic candidates for the party’s nomination. The mayor announced his run with a video released by his campaign. “There’s plenty of money in this world. There’s plenty of money in this country. It’s just in the wrong hands,” De Blasio says at the beginning of the video. He concludes: “I’m running for president because it’s time we put working people first.” De Blasio has traveled to early primary states including Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and formed a federal political action committee (Pac) called Fairness Pac to bankroll his travels. Who is running for president? The full list of 2020 Democratic candidates Read more His message on those travels has centered on economic inequality. De Blasio has sought for years to position himself as a national progressive leader, after racking up accomplishments in his first few years in office including universal pre-kindergarten, paid sick days and living wage legislation and a city ID card available to undocumented immigrants. But frustrations have built over New York’s crumbling public housing system, where hundreds of children got lead poisoning after officials lied about doing inspections, and stubbornly high homelessness. De Blasio has also been the target of multiple ethics inquiries, where no criminal charges were brought, but prosecutors found he made inquiries on behalf of political donors seeking favors. Polls have shown a vast majority of New Yorkers – 76% – don’t think he should run for president, and his aspirations have been widely mocked in his home town and discouraged by his own allies. “I’m glad I’ve unified the people of New York City,” he quipped when asked about the lack of enthusiasm in the polls. De Blasio has been criticized for leaving the city to explore a presidential run in early voting states, and that criticism will probably grow as he travels more for official campaign stops. This week, he is scheduled to campaign in Iowa and South Carolina before traveling to Connecticut for his son’s graduation on Sunday. Political observers said that even if De Blasio’s candidacy doesn’t gain traction, he will be able to promote his policies and potentially angle for a job in a future Democratic administration. He is barred by term limits from running for mayor again. De Blasio’s Pac has been polling voters in Iowa. He said last week in an appearance on WNYC radio that he has not yet hit the polling or donation thresholds to qualify for the Democratic primary debates. The previous New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, decided not to run for president after months of flirting with a bid as a Democrat, opting instead to pour his considerable wealth into the resistance to Donald Trump. Though, since then at least one news report has said Bloomberg was reconsidering his position. In the video announcing his bid, the mayor touted his work pushing a progressive agenda in New York City before arguing that he is the candidate who can defeat the president. “I’m a New Yorker, I’ve known Trump is a bully for a long time,” De Blasio said. Under De Blasio, New York City has challenged Trump immigration policies, including family separation, in court and maintained a commitment to fighting climate change, despite the Trump administration’s rolling back of environmental regulations and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. “Donald Trump must be stopped,” De Blasio said. He is the second Democrat this week to announce they are joining the presidential race, following Montana’s governor, Steve Bullock.

Expand By Chris Sommerfeldt | csommerfeldt@nydailynews.com | New York Daily News and Tim Balk | New York Daily News UPDATED: May 21, 2022 at 12:14 PM EDT Blaz is back on the ballot! Former Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that he’s running for Congress after months of speculation over where he’d next set his political sights. The ex-mayor made his campaign for New York’s 10th congressional district official in a surprise appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” show, citing “polls” as the justification for throwing his hat in the ring. “The polls show the people are hurting, they need help, they need help fast and they need leaders who can actually get them help now, and I know how to do it,” de Blasio said. “I do know how to do it from years of serving the people of this city, so today I am declaring my candidacy for Congress.” Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio The campaign launch comes two days after de Blasio formed an “exploratory committee” to run for the 10th district. It also comes after de Blasio for months weighed — but ultimately ditched — plans to run for governor and a different congressional district. The 10th district is currently represented by veteran Rep. Jerry Nadler. However, the state’s newly drawn congressional map — crafted by a special master after a version favored by Democratic state lawmakers was struck down in court — shifts the heart of Nadler’s constituency into what would be Rep. Carolyn Maloney’s 12th district. As a result, Nadler plans to run in the 12th district, leaving his seat vacant just months before the congressional primaries slated for Aug. 24. De Blasio is far from the only local politician to express interest in running in the 10th district in light of the congressional map shakeup. Then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio winks at someone during the Columbus Day Parade in Manhattan, New York on Monday, Oct. 12, 2015. Among other potential contenders are State Sen. Brad Hoylman, City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, former City Councilman David Yassky as well as a number of State Assembly members, including Robert Carroll, Jo Anne Simon and Yuh-Line Niou. Hoylman and Simon told the Daily News that de Blasio’s entry into the race won’t change their calculus. Holyman said he plans to run and Simon said she would make a decision soon. “He thinks he can bring something to the conversation, and he will run on his resume and what he can do to effectuate change, and I’m going to run on mine,” Simon said of de Blasio. “I think we agree on a lot of progressive issues. I think I go about doing things a little bit differently, and I think I work much more collaboratively with the community.” New York State Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon (D- Brooklyn) asks questions during a public hearing in Albany, N.Y. on Feb. 13, 2019. De Blasio, who has the most name recognition in the race but ostensibly also the most political baggage, scored an early endorsement for his budding campaign on Thursday from Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn, the chairwoman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. “Bill de Blasio is the most qualified progressive candidate who I believe can win this diverse seat,” Bichotte-Hermelyn said in a statement. Under the new congressional map, the 10th district will cover a chunk of western Brooklyn, including Park Slope, as well as a large swath of downtown Manhattan. Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s home on 11th Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York. Though de Blasio lives in Park Slope, Democratic strategist Chris Coffey questioned whether there’s any significant support for the ex-mayor in the new 10th district. “I’m having a little trouble figuring out who de Blasio’s voter is,” said Coffey, who used to work for ex-Mayor Michael Bloomberg and has been critical of de Blasio in the past. “I can look at other candidates and kind of put together their voters. For de Blasio, he’ll have certainly the highest name ID in the district — which matters, but it’s going to be a very low turnout in August.” Shortly after his morning cable news appearance, de Blasio rolled out a campaign website soliciting donations from supporters. “Wherever I go, people ask: can things get better? I say from my heart: YES, but WE have to make them better. In our neighborhoods and our nation, the way to save our democracy is to be part of it,” de Blasio wrote in a tweet linking to the website. “Join us.” Then-Democratic presidential candidate, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addresses a crowd at The Galivants Ferry Stump in South Carolina on September 16, 2019. De Blasio left City Hall on Jan. 1 with a complicated legacy developed over his eight years in charge. As mayor, de Blasio frequently drew criticism from both the left and the right on a slew of issues, including public safety. His mayoral tenure was also marked by a number of high-profile scandals, including a federal investigation into his fundraising practices that produced indictments against several people, though de Blasio was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. Having supported Mayor Adams’ campaign to succeed him last year, de Blasio is likely hoping to court support for his congressional bid from him. But when asked Friday morning if he has plans to back de Blasio’s campaign, Adams was non-committal. “It’s important to see the entire field of who’s running. He has not told me he’s running,” Adams said of his predecessor. “The voters are going to decide.” Originally Published: May 20, 2022 at 6:38 PM EDT Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular NYC private equity lawyer drugged, attacked women with cattle prods, shock collars: prosecutors NYC private equity lawyer drugged, attacked women with cattle prods, shock collars: prosecutors PHOTOS: New Jersey wildfire continues to burn PHOTOS: New Jersey wildfire continues to burn BMW driver charged with murder of Queens motorcyclist in road rage crash: NYPD BMW driver charged with murder of Queens motorcyclist in road rage crash: NYPD Fatal stabbing at City Hall subway station started when suspect stepped on victim’s shoes: NYPD Fatal stabbing at City Hall subway station started when suspect stepped on victim's shoes: NYPD New Jersey 19-year-old accused of sparking massive wildfire in Ocean County New Jersey 19-year-old accused of sparking massive wildfire in Ocean County Wounded gunman charged with attempted murder in stray bullet shooting of Harlem grandmother Wounded gunman charged with attempted murder in stray bullet shooting of Harlem grandmother Daughter of longtime Massachusetts Rep.

To help to translate it into simple English - see the Simple English GFDL page. See also GNU Free Documentation License for what the GFDL is. Do not edit this page Version 1.2, November 2002 0. PREAMBLE   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements." 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

Perlman  11 December 1882 Greenwich Village , Manhattan 20 September 1947 (aged 64) Bronx , New York City Republican Fiorello Henry La Guardia (sometimes LaGuardia) (pronounced / fiəˈrɛloʊ ləˈɡwɑrdiə /; born Fiorello Enrico La Guardia ) was Mayor of New York City for three terms from 1934 to 1945. A member of the Republican Party , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] La Guardia is acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Career [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] He was elected to Congress in 1916 and 1918, and again from 1922 through 1930. La Guardia is often touted as one of the greatest mayors in American history. Since he was only five feet tall and his first name was Italian for "Little Flower", he was called "the Little Flower" throughout his life. [ 9 ] He moved to Arizona with his family, where his father had a bandmaster position at Fort Whipple in the U.S. Army. [ ] La Guardia, a Republican who was liked across party lines, was very popular in New York during the Great Depression . As a supporter of the New Deal , he supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt , a Democrat , and in turn Roosevelt heavily funded the city and cut off patronage from many politicians and establishments who did not support La Guardia. Many people felt that La Guardia improved New York City economically and socially and restored public faith in City Hall . During his terms, he unified the transit system, directed the building of low-cost public housing, public playgrounds, and parks, constructed airports, reorganized the police force, defeated the powerful political machine Tammany Hall , and improved employment rates in New York City, even during the depression. In the mid-1940s, there was a newspaper strike in New York City. La Guardia responded to the public clamor by sitting at a radio microphone and describing and reading the Sunday comics to the children of the city. He described the cartoons and portrayed the dialects and accents of the characters. This endeared La Guardia to the electorate and the children of New York and gave him a larger national image. Personal life [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] La Guardia’s father was a Roman Catholic -turned-atheist, and his mother was Jewish , albeit a non practising one. [ 10 ] La Guardia himself was Episcopalian . [ 11 ] [ ] [ ] La Guardia was a Freemason . [ 12 ] [ ] References [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] ↑ Elliott, Lawrence 1983.

She is married to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio . McCray was described as the "closest advisor" for de Blasio. [ 2 ] McCray is the chairwoman for the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and leads ThriveNYC. [ 3 ] She has also published poetry . McCray worked in politics as a speechwriter. [ ] [ ] [ ] Involvement in the de Blasio administration [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] When de Blasio became mayor, he hired the publicist Rachel Noerdlinger as McCray's chief of staff . [ 4 ] Noerdlinger, however, later resigned her post due to several controversies with her behavior and the behaviors of certain people around her. [ 5 ] [ ] [ ] During his second month in office, de Blasio named McCray the chair of the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City. [ 6 ] Beginning from then, the group was focused on immigration , mental health and youth workforce projects. [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] In November 2015, McCray led the launch of ThriveNYC, a plan for overhauling the city's mental health and substance abuse services. [ 8 ] ThriveNYC promotes a change from the more traditionally more reactive model. That model can strain police , hospitals , prisons and schools , [ 9 ] into an integrated public health approach on being aware and being identified early. [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] ThriveNYC drew harsh criticism over accusations of not being properly managed and accusations that the group failed to produce any records with the proper results. As of March 2019, almost $850 million in funding in McCray's program was unaccounted for. Also, the program was on track to spend just over $1 billion over almost five years. A Bronx Councilman criticized ThriveNYC. He said there was no evidence that the program was working.

Credit Credit... Damon Winter/The New York Times By Michael Barbaro and David W. Chen Nov. 5, 2013 Bill de Blasio, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of New York’s disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city’s 109th mayor on Tuesday. His landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central Brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast Queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at City Hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation’s largest metropolis. Mr. de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, defeated Joseph J. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, by a margin of about 49 percentage points, with 99 percent of the vote counted. It was the most sweeping victory in a mayor’s race since 1985, when Edward I. Koch won by 68 points, and it gave Mr. de Blasio what he said was an unmistakable mandate to pursue his liberal agenda. “My fellow New Yorkers, today, you spoke out loudly and clearly for a new direction for our city,” Mr. de Blasio, a 52-year-old Democrat, said at a raucous party in Park Slope, Brooklyn, at which his teenage children danced onstage and the candidate greeted the crowd in English, Spanish and even a few words of Italian. “Make no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it, together.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

News & Opinion When Bill de Blasio's Wife Was a Lesbian When Bill de Blasio's Wife Was a Lesbian Now an advocate for equality, Chirlane McCray identified as a lesbian before meeting her lawmaker husband and New York City mayoral hopeful. Andrew Belonsky September 03 2013 2:36 PM EST February 05 2015 9:27 PM EST When Bill de Blasio's Wife Was a Lesbian When Bill de Blasio's Wife Was a Lesbian When Bill de Blasio's Wife Was a Lesbian Now an advocate for equality, Chirlane McCray identified as a lesbian before meeting her lawmaker husband and New York City mayoral hopeful. September 03 2013 2:36 PM EST February 05 2015 9:27 PM EST Maureen Dowd was forced to apologize last week for misquoting Chirlane McCray, wife of Democratic New York City mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio. The quote Dowd used in her New York Times column went something like this, "[Fellow Mayoral candidate Christine Quinn is] not the kind of person I feel I can go up to and talk to about issues like taking care of children at a young age and paid sick leave," when in fact McCray said, "Well, I am a woman, and she is not speaking to the issues I care about and I think a lot of women feel the same way. I don't see her speaking to the concerns of women who have to take care of children at a young age or send them to school and after school, paid sick days, workplace, she is not speaking to any of those issues." Explaining her misquote, Dowd told Politico , "The substance is the same, but the quote should be exact." And it was that substance, the idea that Quinn is unapproachable, that rubbed many people the wrong way. Many, including myself, read it as a jibe against Quinn's homosexuality. Apparently that's not what McCray meant, but the incident reminded me of a small scandal from last December when The New York Observer exhumed a 1979 Essence article in which McCray, at that point a member of the black lesbian feminist group called The Combahee River Collective, wrote about how she renounced her lesbian lifestyle after meeting her husband. "I survived the tears, the isolation and the feeling that something was terribly wrong with me for loving another woman. Coming to terms with my life as a lesbian has been easier for me than it has been for many. Since I don't look or dress like the typical bulldagger, I have a choice as to whether my sexual preference is known." McCray also wrote, "I have also been fortunate because I discovered my preference for women early, before getting locked into a traditional marriage and having children." That article came with a tagline that read, "BEYOND FEAR--Lesbian Speaks!" Asked about the article last year, McCray, who along with her progressive husband has advocated for marriage equality, responded: "In the 1970's, I identified as a lesbian and wrote about it. In 1991, I met the love of my life, married him."

[ 1 ] [ ] Most democratic countries hold elections for their national legislature every few years. The elections select representatives for the local areas. These are called Members of Parliament in the British parliamentary system . Parliamentary systems may have a head of government and a head of state , but sometimes the two posts are held by the same person. They may be directly elected or elected by  national legislature . The legislature chooses the government, usually by majority vote in the legislature. Some democracies elect a president , who then selects the government. Most democratic countries also have regional , provincial or state elections and local elections . There are different ways to organize an election. Voters might vote for an individual, or they might vote for a political party . This is because different countries use different voting systems . As a foundation of democracy , voting in elections happens in most countries around the world. Whilst the process of electing an individual as a representative in a government can be simple, many election candidates spend large amounts of money on their campaigns.  Higher household incomes, inflation and population growth have contributed to this trend of higher election spend. [ 2 ] [ ] Every country around the world has different rules and regulations for voting in elections. The biggest differences amongst most major countries is the age in which an individual may vote and whether voting in an election is compulsory or not.  People who are not citizens may not be allowed to vote. Argentina , Brazil and Austria are among the few countries where the legal voting age is 16. Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections. This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative (like a mayor ). Also many countries call themselves democracies, but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of government . Vatican City is a theocracy : The pope (and a few high-ranking clerics ) run the state . When the pope dies, or steps down, the cardinals select a new pope, through an election. When they are done, they will announce the result in a speech, called Habemus Papam (Latin: We have a pope) Elections keep a democratic country functioning, as they give people the right to select their own government. However, there are ways a government can "fix" elections. Opposition candidates are permitted in former USSR countries, but they may be prevented from using broadcasting , social media , or the newspaper s. This means that the ruling president is not challenged. Elections which are fixed are sometimes called sham elections or show elections. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Countries where the candidates are elected with a very high approval rating usually use elections to hide a more autocratic form of government. When Saddam Hussein was elected president of Iraq in 1995, he got 99.96% approval. There were about 8.4 million valid votes,  3,052 people voted against him. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 99.47% of all people allowed to vote did so (this is called voting turnout ). [ 11 ] Another example: Kim Jong-un was elected the leader of North Korea , in 2014, with 100% of the vote.

Membre du Parti démocrate , il est maire de New York de 2014 à 2021. Biographie [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Famille et vie personnelle [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Origines familiales [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Il est d'origine allemande par son père et italienne par sa mère [ 1 ] . Il parle italien [ 2 ] . Il est aisément reconnaissable à sa grande taille, 1,98 m. [ ] [ ] Son père Warren Wilhelm est un héros de la Seconde Guerre mondiale qui a perdu partiellement sa jambe gauche durant la guerre du Pacifique contre les Japonais. Diplômé de Harvard après la guerre mais suspecté de sympathies communistes pendant le maccarthysme , il est privé de fait de tout avancement dans son travail d'analyste au département du Commerce . Il se met à boire, il divorce puis il se suicide après avoir appris qu'il était atteint d'un cancer. La mère de Bill de Blasio, Maria de Blasio, syndicaliste et écrivaine, assure en grande partie son éducation et l'oriente vers le militantisme politique [ 3 ] . Pour se démarquer de l'encombrant passé de son père, Bill de Blasio accole le nom de jeune fille de sa mère (de Blasio) à celui de son père (Wilhelm) pour se faire appeler, en 1983, « Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm ». Finalement, en 2001, son état civil est officiellement changé en « Bill de Blasio » par un juge de Brooklyn [ 4 ] . [ ] [ ] Mariage [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] En 1983, Bill de Blasio achève ses études supérieures à l' université Columbia . En 1994, il se marie à la poétesse afro-américaine Chirlane McCray , qu'il avait rencontrée en 1989 lorsqu'il était en poste au service des affaires communautaires de la Ville de New York . Elle travaillait alors au service de presse et écrivait des discours pour le maire de l'époque, David Dinkins [ 3 ] . Elle, qui se présentait auparavant comme lesbienne , parle de sa rencontre avec Bill de Blasio comme de celle de « l'amour de [sa] vie » [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . Ils se marient devant un couple de prêtres homosexuels [ 3 ] et n'hésitent pas à se rendre à Cuba pour leur lune de miel à une époque où le pays est interdit aux citoyens américains [ 6 ] . Ils ont deux enfants, Dante et Chiara. [ ] « l'amour de [sa] vie » [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Carrière politique  [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Militant humanitaire [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] En 1988, il participe à une mission humanitaire organisée par le Quixote Center du Maryland à Masaya au Nicaragua . Il est impressionné par les réalisations de la révolution sandiniste (condamnée par les États-Unis) et, à son retour, il milite dans des organisations de soutien à ce régime tout en se montrant critique envers la répression menée contre les dissidents [ 6 ] . Il s'investit également dans des organisations pacifistes, antinucléaires et antiapartheid [ 4 ] . [ ] [ ] Début en politique  [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] En 1989 , il est volontaire au sein de l'équipe de campagne du démocrate David Dinkins , candidat victorieux à la mairie de New York. En 1992 , il rejoint celle de Bill Clinton , candidat à la présidence des États-Unis. En 2000 , il est dans l'équipe dirigeante de la campagne sénatoriale d' Hillary Clinton dans l'État de New York ; elle est élue [ 7 ] , [ 4 ] . [ ] [ ] Conseiller municipal représentant la 39 e circonscription de New York de 2002 à 2009, il occupe à partir du 1 er janvier 2010 la fonction de médiateur de la Ville ( New York City Public Advocate ). En 2008, il s'oppose à la demande du maire, Michael Bloomberg , de changer la règlementation électorale afin d'effectuer un troisième mandat ; ses adversaires soulignent qu'en 2005, il défendait la position inverse [ 4 ] . New York City Public Advocate [ ] En 2011, il soutient le mouvement Occupy Wall Street [ 3 ] qui proclame : « La chose que nous avons tous en commun est que nous sommes les 99 % qui ne tolèreront plus la rapacité et la corruption du 1 % restant » [ 8 ] . [ ] [ ] Maire de New York [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Élection  [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Lors de la campagne pour l'élection municipale new-yorkaise de 2013, la primaire démocrate, d'abord dominée par Christine Quinn , lui est finalement favorable ; il axe sa campagne sur la défense des « petites gens ». Il est accusé par le maire sortant, Michael Bloomberg (qui ne peut prétendre à un quatrième mandat), de « racisme » : il mettrait, selon ce dernier, trop en avant son épouse et ses enfants afro-américains afin de s'attirer les voix de la communauté noire [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . Il promet plus de logements sociaux et d'écoles maternelles, une police plus à l'écoute des minorités et une augmentation des impôts pour les plus riches [ 4 ] . [ ] [ ] [ ] Le 5 novembre 2013, il est opposé au républicain Joe Lhota lors de l'élection. Il la remporte avec plus de 73 % des voix, devenant le premier maire démocrate de New York depuis David Dinkins , élu en 1989 [ 11 ] . [ ] Il prête serment le 1 er janvier 2014, après les douze coups de minuit, sur une Bible ayant appartenu au président Franklin Delano Roosevelt ; Hillary et Bill Clinton sont présents lors de la cérémonie [ 7 ] , ainsi que des représentants de diverses catégories de la population, notamment un imam, Askia Muhammad, qui prononce une brève allocution [ 12 ] . [ ] [ ] Peu de temps après ce serment sur la Bible, une rumeur se répand selon laquelle il est athée . Il dément cette « accusation » et déclare qu'il n'est attaché à aucune religion en particulier mais qu'il a une vie spirituelle [ 13 ] . [ ] Gestion de la ville [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] Bill de Blasio se considère comme social-libéral [ 14 ] ( liberal en anglais) et progressiste [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . C'est aussi un homme politique réaliste et habile Interprétation abusive ? auquel il arrive de ne pas respecter à la lettre ses promesses électorales. Par exemple, dans le domaine clé de la sécurité, pour mettre en place sa police plus à l'écoute des minorités, il nomme William Bratton . Ce dernier avait déjà été à la tête de la police new-yorkaise entre 1994 et 1996, sous l'administration Giuliani ; il avait appliqué une politique réputée efficace, de « tolérance zéro », contre la criminalité. Mais ce choix ne s'avère pas payant pour de Blasio, il doit révoquer Bratton au bout de trois ans, à la suite de plusieurs accusations d'actes racistes perpétrés par ses hommes [ 17 ] . [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Parmi ses promesses de campagne, on trouve aussi la suppression des calèches pour les touristes à Central Park ; finalement, il décide de réduire le nombre des chevaux et d'encadrer leurs horaires de travail [ 18 ] . [ ] Il est soupçonné de corruption pour le financement de sa campagne électorale de 2013 [ 19 ] . La procédure à son encontre est abandonnée en mars 2017. Un rapport final dénonce toutefois certaines pratiques de son équipe de campagne [ 20 ] . [ ] [ ] Il est décrit comme étant peu apprécié des milieux d'affaires [ 21 ] . [ ] Réélection  [ modifier | modifier le code ] [ modifier | modifier le code ] En 2017, il est candidat à sa réélection , contre la républicaine Nicole Malliotakis . Le 7 novembre, il remporte le scrutin avec 66,5 % des voix contre 27,8 % pour sa rivale [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . [ ] [ ] En mai 2019, de Blasio annonce sa candidature à l' investiture démocrate pour l' élection présidentielle de 2020 [ 24 ] , mais, quatre mois plus tard, le 20 septembre, il fait savoir qu'il renonce à ses ambitions nationales [ 25 ] . En février 2020, il annonce qu'il soutient Bernie Sanders [ 26 ] . [ ] [ ] [ ] Le 20 avril 2020, alors que New York est durement touchée par la pandémie de Covid-19 , il exhorte le président Trump , ancien New-Yorkais, à « sauver sa ville » en agissant pour que la majorité républicaine au Sénat augmente les aides financières fédérales aux villes et aux États du pays qui font face à la pandémie [ 27 ] . [ ] Il quitte ses fonctions le 31 décembre 2021, à l'issue de son second mandat.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Usually, it refers to a person far in the past, rather than the parents or grandparents in the close family . [ 3 ] A very similar word is forebear . A female ancestor may be called an ancestress . [ 4 ] The line of ancestors from which an organism descends is referred to as its ancestry . [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] A second meaning relates to evolution . There, it is used of a species or group of species of animals or plants from which others have evolved . [ 3 ] [ 5 ] In a similar way, the word ancestor can be used for an early prototype or forerunner of a later device. [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In law an ancestor can mean the person from whom an estate is lawfully obtained. [ 6 ] No blood relationship is necessarily implied . [ 6 ] More commonly, however, it is the person from whom an estate is obtained based on law and blood. [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Two people have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other, or if they share a common ancestor. Each of someone's ancestors will have contributed to their DNA . [ 7 ] In evolution , species that have evolved from the same ancestor are said to be of common descent . However, this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer . DNA testing is used in determining ancestry. This can be for paternity testing, to determine the parents of a child for legal purposes. [ 8 ] DNA is also used to better understand the ancestry and history of all humans over the last 50,000 years. [ 9 ] This was one of the benefits of the Human genome project . [ 10 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In some cultures ancestors may have relatively little importance. Many today have no knowledge of their own great-great-grandparents. [ 11 ] China is an example of a culture that in general has a deep respect for ancestors. [ 12 ] Korea is an example of a culture that engages in ancestor worship where ancestors are revered . [ 13 ] But genealogy (the study of one's ancestors) is growing in popularity and includes both amateur and professional genealogists.

Bill de Blasio , eredeti nevén Warren Wilhelm, Jr. ( New York , 1961 . május 8. –) New York 109. polgármestere , hivatalát 2014. január 1. óta tölti be. Személyében 20 év óta először tölti be demokrata párti politikus a tisztséget. A polgármester-választást 2013. november 5-én tartották, ahol de Blasio a szavazatok 73%-át kapta meg annak ellenére, hogy korábban esélytelennek tartották a cím elnyerésére. Kampányában a cégeket érintő adókedvezmények megnyirbálását és a leggazdagabbak megadóztatását ígérte. Jegyzetek [ szerkesztés ] [ szerkesztés ] ↑ Encyclopædia Britannica (angol nyelven).

Trước cuộc bầu cử đầu tiên vào vị trí Thị trưởng, ông đã từng là người ủng hộ công chúng của Thành phố New York từ năm 2010 đến 2013. /dɪˈblɑːzioʊ/ Sinh ra ở Manhattan , ông tốt nghiệp Đại học New York và Đại học Columbia trước khi có một thời gian ngắn làm người quản lý chiến dịch cho Charles Rangel và Hillary Clinton . Ông bắt đầu sự nghiệp với tư cách là một quan chức được bầu bằng cách phục vụ trong Hội đồng thành phố New York đại diện cho quận 39 ở Brooklyn từ năm 2002 đến 2009. Nhiệm kỳ của ông với tư cách là người ủng hộ công chúng đã thấy một sự cải cách của các chính sách giáo dục, nhà ở và chiến dịch. Ông được bầu làm Thị trưởng Thành phố New York trong cuộc bầu cử chiến thắng vang dội năm 2013 và tái đắc cử chức vụ này vào năm 2017, một cuộc bầu cử chiến thắng vang dội khác. Ông đã khởi xướng chương trình huấn luyện giảm leo thang mới cho các sĩ quan, giảm các vụ truy tố về sở hữu cần sa, thực hiện việc sử dụng máy ảnh của cảnh sát và chấm dứt chương trình giám sát sau ngày 9/11 của cư dân Hồi giáo. Sáng kiến ​​chữ ký của ông với tư cách là thị trưởng là việc thực hiện Pre-K phổ quát miễn phí trong thành phố. Nỗ lực của ông để bắt đầu một triệu phú thuế đã bị từ chối bởi thống đốc New York Andrew Cuomo . De Blasio đã cố gắng cài đặt một căn hộ đóng băng chưa từng có trên toàn thành phố cho các căn hộ ổn định tiền thuê trong năm 2015. De Blasio đã kêu gọi sự chú ý đến những gì ông nói đến như một mức độ bất bình đẳng kinh tế nghiêm trọng ở thành phố New York, nơi ông mô tả là một "câu chuyện về hai thành phố" trong chiến dịch đầu tiên của mình. Ông đã công khai ủng hộ một diễn ngôn tự do xã hội và tiến bộ về kinh tế thành phố, quy hoạch đô thị, giáo dục công cộng, quan hệ cảnh sát và tư nhân hóa. De Blasio đã duy trì tỷ lệ tán thành hỗn hợp trong suốt nhiệm kỳ của mình. [ nb 1 ] Vào ngày 16 tháng 5 năm 2019, de Blasio tuyên bố ứng cử vào các cuộc bầu cử sơ bộ của Đảng Dân chủ cho cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Hoa Kỳ 2020 .

Controversial content about living persons that does not have any sources or is poorly sourced must be removed straight away from the article and its talk page, especially if it harms their reputation . If such content is repeatedly added to the page or if there are other concerns related to this rule, report it on the Administrators' noticeboard .   This article contains a translation of Bill de Blasio from en.wikipedia . Is this the only entry on de Blasio? Sooo much more to say    [ change source ] [ change source ] I looked around for other links to him. Perhaps I am missing the obvious. But there is so much more to say about his mayoralty:  First, his wife, Chirlane McCray, was in charge of a $1B city program on mental health that couldn't account for expenditures and lacked any real evidence of positive outcomes. [Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/nyregion/thrivenyc-mental-health-.html Cf the wikipedia article on Chirlane.] Second, his negative impact on homelessness is historic: [Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/de-blasio-report-card-inequity.html#:~:text=65%20percent%20increase%20in%20single%20adults%20living%20in%20shelters&text=But%20on%20homelessness%2C%20what%20has,11%20percent%20during%20his%20tenure. ] Third, as Mayor, he presided over homeless people being moved from shelters to lower-level and even mid-level hotels, many on Manhattan's Upper West Side, to minimize the spread of COVID. The plan was to isolate those who might infect others. The effect is that the homeless people just enjoyed themselves on the street -- defecating, harrassing, and having sex in stairwells -- often around families with small children. [source: https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/05/19/de-blasio-pushes-hard-against-moving-all-homeless-to-hotels-1284548 ] There is more, of course. And there were a few positive things, certainly. His mayoralty was one of the worst things NYC has experienced in generations, and the Wikipedia entry is unbelievably scant and only positive/neutral. Nothing critical. I'm frankly shocked.

Share full article 147 147 Bill de Blasio, the former New York City mayor, said it was clear that “people are looking for another option.” Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times By Nicholas Fandos July 19, 2022 Bill de Blasio, the former mayor of New York City, abruptly ended a campaign for Congress on Tuesday, saying that voters were clearly “looking for another option” and that his time in electoral politics was over. Mr. de Blasio had gleefully jumped into the race for the open, safely Democratic seat in late May, hoping to revive his career after eight years as mayor and several months in the political wilderness. There was no better path, he reasoned, than the newly drawn House seat, which covers parts of Lower Manhattan and the section of brownstone Brooklyn that constitutes his political home. But as he crisscrossed the district — touting his universal prekindergarten program and sometimes campaigning in gym shorts — Mr. de Blasio struggled to overcome low approval numbers from his days as mayor. Polls, including one commissioned by his campaign, showed him performing poorly in a crowded field of a dozen other Democrats , and he watched as one-time allies and donors gave their support to younger rivals. In an unusually candid video posted to his Twitter account Tuesday afternoon announcing his decision, Mr. de Blasio, 61, grappled openly with his unpopularity and unspecified “mistakes.” “I’ve listened really carefully to people,” he said. “And it’s clear to me when it comes to this congressional district, people are looking for another option, and I respect that.” Mr. de Blasio, who ran a disastrous campaign for president in 2020 and waffled over whether to run for governor this year, said that he would take time to recalibrate his approach after the reception he got on the campaign trail — but added, with an air of finality, that it was “time for me to leave electoral politics.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

[ ] De Blasio è nato a Manhattan e cresciuto principalmente a Cambridge , nel Massachusetts . Si è laureato all' Università di New York e alla Columbia University prima di un breve periodo come responsabile della campagna per Charles Rangel e Hillary Clinton . De Blasio ha iniziato la sua carriera come funzionario eletto nel New York City Council, rappresentando il 39º distretto di Brooklyn dal 2002 al 2009. Dopo aver servito un mandato come avvocato pubblico, è stato eletto sindaco di New York nel 2013 e rieletto nel 2017. Le iniziative politiche di De Blasio hanno incluso una nuova formazione per la riduzione dell'escalation per gli agenti di polizia, la riduzione dei processi per il possesso di cannabis , l'implementazione delle telecamere del corpo della polizia e la fine del programma di sorveglianza post 11 settembre dei residenti musulmani. De Blasio ha richiamato l'attenzione su quella che definisce una forte disuguaglianza economica a New York , che ha descritto come una "storia di due città" durante la sua prima campagna. Ha sostenuto le politiche progressiste in materia di economia della città, pianificazione urbana, istruzione pubblica , rapporti di polizia e privatizzazione . De Blasio ha corso alle primarie democratiche in vista delle elezioni presidenziali del 2020 . Dopo aver registrato numeri bassi nei sondaggi e non essere riuscito a qualificarsi per il terzo round dei dibattiti primari, ha sospeso la sua campagna il 20 settembre 2019 e ha sostenuto Bernie Sanders cinque mesi dopo. Biografia [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Nasce a Manhattan , distretto della città di New York , da Warren Wilhelm e Maria de Blasio. Il padre, militare dislocato nell' Oceano Pacifico , aveva ascendenze tedesche mentre i nonni materni, Giovanni De Blasio e Anna Briganti, erano italiani: il primo era originario di Sant'Agata de' Goti ( provincia di Benevento , dove il cognome è diffuso con la "D" maiuscola), mentre la nonna era nativa di Grassano , in provincia di Matera . [ 2 ] Bill è cresciuto a Cambridge , nel Massachusetts , e ha studiato la lingua italiana a Brooklyn . [ ] De Blasio aveva sette anni quando suo padre, alcolizzato e fumatore accanito, andò via di casa creando i presupposti per il successivo divorzio [ 3 ] ottenuto circa un anno dopo. Il genitore finì per suicidarsi nel 1979 con un colpo d'arma da fuoco, gesto motivato anche dalle sofferenze causate da un enfisema e dalle metastasi di un tumore ai polmoni . [ 4 ] [ ] [ ] Nel 1983 cambiò legalmente il suo nome in Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm; dal 1990 in poi si fece chiamare Bill de Blasio, adottando legalmente tale nome nel 2002. [ 1 ] Ottiene il titolo accademico di bachelor of Arts in studi metropolitani [ 5 ] all' Università di New York [ 6 ] e in seguito consegue un master in Affari internazionali alla Columbia University . [ 7 ] Nel 1981 viene premiato con una borsa di studio intitolata al 33º presidente degli Stati Uniti d'America , l' Harry S. Truman Scholarship . [ 8 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Carriera [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Socialista fin da giovane, De Blasio, tra la fine degli anni ottanta e l'inizio del decennio successivo fu un simpatizzante della lotta dei sandinisti in Nicaragua , combattuti dall'allora presidente statunitense Ronald Reagan . [ 9 ] [ ] È stato consigliere nel 1997 del presidente statunitense Bill Clinton e dirigente della campagna elettorale del 2000 di Hillary Clinton per il Senato degli Stati Uniti , risultata vincente. [ 10 ] Esponente dell'ala sinistra del Partito Democratico , De Blasio si definisce liberal e progressista e manifesta apertamente la sua ammirazione per il socialismo democratico , al punto da essersi descritto come un " socialdemocratico di tipo europeo" durante un viaggio in Italia [ 11 ] . [ ] [ ] Già public advocate di New York , nel 2013 si candida come sindaco di New York impostando la sua campagna elettorale sull'aumento delle tasse per i residenti ricchi in modo da finanziare gli asili nido e il salario minimo . Il 6 novembre viene eletto sindaco , battendo il candidato repubblicano Joseph Lhota con oltre il 73% delle preferenze, vent'anni dopo l'ultimo sindaco democratico della " Grande Mela ", David Dinkins . [ 12 ] È il quarto sindaco di New York italoamericano dopo Fiorello La Guardia (1934–45), Vincent Impellitteri (1950–53) e Rudolph Giuliani (1994–2001). [ 13 ] Con la sua statura di 1,96 m è il più alto sindaco della storia di New York. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Si ricandida come sindaco per le elezioni del 2017 e viene rieletto per un secondo mandato con il 66,5% dei voti battendo la repubblicana Nicole Malliotakis ferma al 27,8%. In vista dell'estate 2021, per rilanciare il turismo nella sua città, ha proposto di offrire il vaccino anti- COVID-19 gratis a tutti i turisti nelle più famose attrazioni di New York [ 16 ] . [ ] Come i suoi due immediati predecessori Rudolph Giuliani e Michael Bloomberg , anche De Blasio ha fatto della lotta alla criminalità uno dei suoi punti di forza: a partire dal 2017 il tasso di criminalità riguardante i reati di violenza e di furti è ulteriormente sceso [ 17 ] ; in particolar modo gli omicidi, calati, secondo il New York Police Department , fino a scendere, al di sotto dei 300 nello stesso 2017 e nel 2018. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Tuttavia, negli ultimi 2 anni del suo mandato, che coincisero con un periodo di pandemia, si registrò un nuovo aumento degli omicidi, superando i 460 nel 2020, e superando i 480 nel 2021. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Candidatura alle primarie democratiche per le Presidenziali 2020 [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Il 16 maggio 2019 annuncia con un video di tre minuti la sua candidatura alle primarie democratiche per le elezioni presidenziali del 2020. [ 22 ] Tuttavia annuncia il ritiro il 20 settembre 2019, dichiarando: "Non è il mio tempo". [ 23 ] Pochi mesi dopo annuncia il suo sostegno alla candidatura del senatore Bernie Sanders , poi ritiratosi dalla corsa presidenziale lasciando campo libero a Joe Biden , quest'ultimo poi eletto presidente nel novembre 2020. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Vita privata [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] È sposato dal 1994 con Chirlane McCray, afroamericana, poetessa ed attivista per i diritti della comunità LGBT , che era dichiaratamente omosessuale nel precedente periodo di nubilato. La coppia ha svolto il viaggio di nozze a Cuba nonostante l' embargo imposto al paese. De Blasio e la McCray si sono incontrati mentre lavoravano per l'amministrazione del sindaco Dinkins. Dopo aver vissuto a Park Slope, a Brooklyn , si sono trasferiti a Gracie Mansion , residenza tradizionale dei sindaci di New York. Hanno due figli: Dante, diplomato alla Brooklyn Technical High School e studente all' Università Yale , e Chiara, studentessa all'università Santa Clara in California . Ama trascorrere le vacanze in Italia e conosce parzialmente l' italiano , lingua che utilizza a volte in interviste, conferenze stampa e discorsi. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] È inoltre un tifoso del Napoli .

History [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The capital of Italy is Rome . Rome was founded in 753 BC. It was a separate state well known as Roman Kingdom firstly, Roman Republic and Roman Empire later. It conquered various neighbors including the Etruscan civilization in the north and the states in the south known as Magna Graecia . Before 1861, Italy was not a state . The area included a group of separate states that were ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain). In the 1850s, the Earl of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour was the head of government of the "State of Sardinia". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state. Kingdom of Italy [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. [ 15 ] Victor Emmanuel II was made the king. In 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire . [ ] Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria. Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification . Italy participated in World War I . It was an ally of Great Britain , France , and Russia against the Central Powers . Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern border , near Austria. After the "Caporetto defeat", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered . Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria. Fascist Italy [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] In 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini , the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator , calling himself "Il Duce" (which means " leader " in Italian ). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler . Germany , Japan , and Italy entered the Axis Powers . In 1940, they entered World War II together against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union . During the war, Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea . On July 25, 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism. On September 8, 1943, Badoglio said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know whom to shoot. In Northern Italy, a movement called Resistenza started to fight against the German invaders . On April 25, 1945, much of Italy became free, while Mussolini tried to make a small Northern Italian fascist state called the Republic of Salò . The fascist state failed and Mussolini tried to flee to Switzerland and escape to Francoist Spain , but he was captured by Italian partisans . On 28 April 1945 Mussolini was executed by a partisan. After World War Two [ change | change source ] [ change | change source ] The state became a republic on June 2, 1946. For the first time, women were able to vote. The Italian people ended the Savoia dynasty and adopted a republican form of government. In February of 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies . They lost all the colonies and some territorial areas ( Istria and parts of Dalmatia ). Since then Italy has joined NATO and the European Community (as a founding member). It is one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.

After nearly half a year of hemming and hawing, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday entered the 2020 presidential race, becoming the 24th Democrat to join the jam-packed field. The termed-out politician, known for his habitual tardiness, finally decided to run after five months of toying with a White House bid. “I’m Bill de Blasio and I’m running for president because it’s time we put working people first,” the mayor said in a three-minute YouTube video announcing his candidacy. The opening shots include de Blasio zipping around the city in the back of an SUV — his gas-guzzling choice of transportation for the 11-mile jaunt from Gracie Mansion to the gym in Park Slope. “Good thing about New Yorkers is they look the same whether they’re really pissed off at you or they like you,” the mayor quips. He details his “Working People First” slogan by touting his policy initiatives including pre-K for all, paid sick leave and boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour. First lady Chirlane McCray also makes an appearance to briefly plug her mental health agenda . “Everything begins with being healthy and there is no health without mental health,” she says. Then, as the White House flashes on the screen to dramatic music, de Blasio pivots to a national message. “Don’t back down in the face of the bully — take him on,” he says. “As president, I will take on the wealthy, I will take on the big corporations, I will not rest until this government serves working people.” He also vows to fight President Trump head-on. “Donald Trump must be stopped. I’ve beaten him before and I’ll do it again,” de Blasio says. Insiders initially thought de Blasio would announce his national campaign the week of his 58th birthday on May 8, but he delayed. “So you’re still deciding?” NY1’s Errol Louis asked the mayor on May 6. “Yes indeed,” the dithering mayor said. Local political experts can’t fathom what prompted the mayor to take the plunge. “It’s really hard to understand what lane de Blasio plans to ride to the nomination,” said David Birdsell, dean of the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at CUNY’s Baruch College. What’s more, people just don’t like him, polls show. De Blasio has the dubious distinction of being the only candidate or potential candidate out of 23 contenders to earn a negative rating among national Democrats in a March Monmouth University survey. A total of 24 percent gave him a thumbs down while just 18 percent had a favorable view of him. At home, the numbers are even worse. A staggering 76 percent of Big Apple voters don’t think he should run , according to an April Quinnipiac University Poll. See Also New York thinks de Blasio's got no shot at 2020 presidential election Since de Blasio was elected the 109th mayor in 2013 on a “Tale of Two Cities” platform, he’s disappointed many of the liberals who put him in office. The city’s long-struggling Housing Authority collapsed under the weight of a lead-poisoning scandal, culminating in a federal lawsuit alleging a massive cover-up of toxic living conditions and a repair bill that hit an eye-watering $32 billion in 2018. De Blasio was forced to accept federal oversight of NYCHA to settle a lawsuit brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors and has embraced the partial privatization — once an anathema — as one way to pay for renovations at many of its 325 projects. While NYCHA rotted, the city’s homelessness crisis ballooned. Roughly 60,000 New Yorkers are now living on the streets, while the administration struggles to battle back neighborhood opposition to new homeless shelters. Continuing probes alleged pay-to-play schemes have dogged de Blasio’s mayoralty. The state Joint Commission on Public Ethics is still investigating his shuttered Campaign For One New York, a nonprofit that folded in 2016 after taking in $4.3 million to promote his pet projects, including pre-K expansion. De Blasio ducked federal and state charges in 2017 after he was accused of handing out favors in exchange for donations to his political group. But the city Department of Investigation concluded in 2018 that the mayor hit up individuals and companies with matters pending before city agencies to fill the coffers of the Campaign For One New York. And the corruption claims linger. City Comptroller Scott Stringer has subpoenaed the mayor for information about a $173 million real estate deal with developers Stuart and Jay Podolsky, who are represented by politically connected Brooklyn attorney Frank Carone. The city paid the Podolskys $30 million above the appraised price for 21 buildings in the Bronx and Brooklyn to create more affordable housing. Carone donated $5,000 to de Blasio’s Fairness PAC last fall. The mayor has defended the price tag, saying it was cheaper than taking the properties by eminent domain. He’s also said there was nothing wrong with accepting Carone’s cash because it was cleared by his lawyers. The scandal will likely follow de Blasio on the campaign trail, where he’d rather talk up his progressive message of free pre-K and paid sick leave. They’re the two shining examples from his time at City Hall. Before he took office in 2013, there were under 20,000 city kids in public pre-kindergarten. Now 70,000 4-year-olds are enrolled in the free program. In March 2014, he signed a bill requiring city employers to give up to five paid sick days to their workers each year. De Blasio has laid some groundwork for the campaign — talking to small crowds in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. He spoke to 20 people in Concord, New Hampshire, in March and just nine in Pahrump, Nevada, in April. He heads to Iowa and South Carolina again this weekend. He doesn’t have much time to convince would-be voters why he’s the one to take on Trump. The first Democratic debate is in Miami on June 26 and 27. De Blasio may not even qualify for the debate because his poll numbers don’t meet the 1 percent threshold. History is also not on de Blasio’s side. “There are reasons why mayors of New York City haven’t done well in national politics and that’s because people don’t associate with their problems with those problems,” said Birdsell, the CUNY dean. The checkered past goes back to 1812, when New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton lost to incumbent James Madison. John Lindsay’s 1972 White House bid petered out during the primaries, and Rudy Giuliani came up short in 2008. The mayor must spend time bulking up his campaign team. His Fairness PAC, which has organized his recent out-of-state visits, currently has a largely volunteer, skeleton staff. It’s led by Jon Paul Lupo, who took a leave from his city position as director of intergovernmental affairs and is using vacation days to work on the PAC. Deputy press secretary Olivia Lapeyrolerie and deputy director of executive operations Alexandra Kopel are also using leave and their time off to boost the mayor’s 2020 bid. Former top aide Mike Casca, who’d worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ previous presidential run, first left City Hall for the PAC, then cut ties with de Blasio altogether earlier this month. Finally, the mayor’s longtime press secretary, Eric Phillips, decamped for the private sector in April.

Ուորեն անունը և Վիլհելմ կրտսեր ազգանունը։ Հայրը՝ Ուորեն Ուիլհելմը գերմանական ծագմամբ ամերիկացի է, մայրը` Մարիան, Բենևենտո քաղաքից իտալացի ներգաղթյալներ Ջովանիի և Աննա Դե Բլասիոյի դուստրն է [ 5 ] [ 6 ] ։ Շուտով Վիլհելմի ընտանիքը տեղափոխվում է Քեմբրիջ ( Մասաչուսեթս ) [ 7 ] ։ 1968 թվականին Ուորենի հայրը լքում է ընտանիքը և մեկ տարի անց ծնողները բաժանվում են [ 8 ] ։ 2012 թվականի ապրիլին տված հարցազրույցում Դե Բլասիոն ասել է, որ հայրը ԱՄՆ բանակի սպա է և Երկրորդ աշխարհամարտի տարիներին պատերազմել է Խաղաղ օվկիանոսում , մասնավորապես մասնակցել է Օկինավայի ճակատամարտում, որը խաղաղօվկիանոսյան ճակատում տեղի ունեցած բոլոր ժամանակների ամենաարյունահեղ մարտերից մեկն էր։ Ըստ Բիլի սա բացասաբար է անդրադարձել Ուորեն սրբի հոգեկան և բարոյական վիճակի վրա և հետագայում հանգեցրել է նրա հոր ալկոհոլիզմին և ամուսնալուծությանը [ 9 ] ։ Ծնողների բաժանումից հետո Ուորեն կրտսերը մեծացել է մոր ընտանիքում։ 2013 թվականի սեպտեմբերին Դե Բլասիոն ասել է, որ հայրը թոքերի քաղցկեղ ուներ, իսկ 1979 թվականին ինքնասպանություն է գործել [ 10 ] ։ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 1983 թվականին 22-ամյա Ուորեն Ուիլհելմ կրտսերը պաշտոնապես փոխել է ազգանունը Դե Բլասիո-Վիլհելմի։ 1990 թվականին հայտնվել է հասարակական բեմում, օգտագործել է Բիլ Դե Բլասիո անունը, քանի որ իր անձնական կյանքում սովորաբար անվանում էին «Բիլ» կամ «Բիլի» [ 9 ] ։ Իրավականորեն Ուորեն անունը Բիլ Դե Բլասիոյի փոխվել է 2002 թվականին, երբ ընտրությունների ժամանակ նկատվել է անհամապատասխանություն [ 11 ] ։ [ ] [ ] 1981 թվականին Դե Բլասիոն ստացել է Հարի Թրումենի դրամաշնորհ [ 12 ] ։ Նյու Յորքի համալսարանից ստացել է  բակալավրի կոչում, ինչպես նաև Կոլումբիայի համալսարանի Միջազգային հարաբերությունների դպրոցից միջազգային հարաբերությունների մագիստրոսի կոչում [ 13 ] ։ 1983 թվականին որպես Նյու Յորքի համալսարանի ուսանող ճանապարհորդել է ԽՍՀՄ -ով։ [ ] [ ] Կարիերայի սկիզբ  [ խմբագրել | խմբագրել կոդը ] [ խմբագրել | խմբագրել կոդը ] Իր կարիերան սկսել է 1984 թվականից՝ դառնալով Նյու Յորքի անչափահասների կրթաթոշակային ծրագրի բաժնի աշխատակից։ 1987 թվականին Կոլումբիայի համալսարանում ավարտական դասընթացներն ավարտելուց անմիջապես հետո դարձում է Մերիլենդ նահանգի Quixote Center համայնքային իրավաբանական ֆիրմայի քաղաքական կազմակերպիչը, որն ակտիվորեն աջակցում էր 1980-ականներին Նիկարագուայում գտնվող սանդիստների կառավարությանը [ 14 ] [ 15 ] ։ 1988 թվականին Բիլը որպես Quixote Center-ի ներկայացուցիչ 10 օր անցկացրել է Նիկարագուայում՝ օգնելով բաժանել սնունդ և դեղամիջոցներ։ Այդ ժամանակ Դե Բլասիոն սանդիստների կողմնակիցն էր, որոնք դեմ էին նախագահ Ռեյգանի վարչակազմին։ [ ] [ ] Նիկարագուայից վերադառնալուց հետո Բիլը տեղափոխվել է Նյու Յորք, որտեղ աշխատել է Կենտրոնական Ամերիկայի առողջապահության բարելավմանն ուղված ոչ առևտրային կազմակերպությունում [ 15 ] ։ Ազատ ժամանակ շարունակել է աջակցել սանդինիստներին՝ միանալով Մեծ Նյու Յորքի Նիկարագուայի համերաշխության ցանցին, Նիկարագուայի Համերաշխության ցանցի խմբին, որն անցկացնում էր հանդիպումներ և միջոցներ էր հավաքում սանդինիստների համար [ 15 ] ։ Դե Բլասիոն 1989-ին՝ դարձել է Նյու Յորքի Դեյվիդ Դինկինսի ընտրարշավի կամավոր համակարգող [ 15 ] ։ Իր թեկնածուի հաղթանակից հետո Բիլը քաղաքապետարանում աշխատում էր որպես օգնական [ 16 ] [ 17 ] ։ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Նյու Յորքի քաղաքային խորհուրդ  [ խմբագրել | խմբագրել կոդը ]

դատախազի թեկնածությունն առաջադրելու համար պայքարելու մտադրության մասին։ Նրա թեկնածությանը աջակցել են New York Times-ը [ 25 ] , Բեթսի Գոթբաումը, 2-րդ հասարակական դատախազը, Նյու Յորքի նախկին քաղաքապետ Էդ Կոչը, Նյու Յորքի նահանգի նախկին նահանգապետ Մարիո Կուոմոն և սուրբ Էլ Շարփթոնը (ամերիկյան բապտիստական եկեղեցու քահանա, ակտիվիստ-իրավապաշտպան և հեռուստառադիոհաղորդավար) [ 26 ] ։ [ ] [ ] 2009 թվականի սեպտեմբերի 15-ին Դե Բլասիոն Ժողովրդավարական կուսակցության փրայմերիզի առաջին փուլում զբաղեցրել է առաջին տեղը՝ ստանալով ձայների 33%-ը։ Նույն թվականի սեպտեմբերի 29-ին հաղթել է առաջնային ընտրությունների երկրորդ փուլը՝ հավաքելով 145.413 ձայն (62,35%) և պարտության մատնել Նյու Յորքի առաջին հանրային դատախազ Մարկ Գրինին, որը որոշել էր վերադառնալ այդ պաշտոնին [ 27 ] ։ 2009 թվականի նոյեմբերի 3-ին Դե Բլասիոն ստացել է 724,629 ձայն (77,56%)՝ հաղթելով հինգ մրցակիցների, այդ թվում՝ հանրապետական Ալեքս Զաբլոցկուն։ 2010 թվականի հունվարի 1-ին Բիլը ստանձնել է Նյու Յորքի երրորդ դատախազի պաշտոնը [ 28 ] ։ Իր երդմնակալության խոսքում նա քննադատել է քաղաքապետ Մայքլ Բլումբերգի վարչակազմին՝ իր կրթական քաղաքականության և անօթևանների կարիքների նկատմամբ ցուցաբերած վերաբերմունքի համար [ 29 ] ։ [ ] [ ] [ ] Որպես հասարակական իրավաբան Դե Բլասիոն բազմիցս կտրուկ քննադատում էր քաղաքապետ Բլումբերգի կրթական քաղաքականությունը։ Նա քաջալերել է Քեթի Բլեքին (այն ժամանակ Նյու Յորքի դպրոցների կանցլեր), մասնակցելու հանրային ֆորումների և քննադատել է նրան, որ Քեթին երեխաներին չի ուղարկել հանրակրթական դպրոցներ։ 2010 թվականի մարտին Դե Բլասիոն դեմ է արտահայտվել Մետրոպոլիտենի տրանսպորտային մարմնի առաջարկությանը` չեղարկելով

նշելով, որ հանրային դպրոցները պետք է լինեն ուշադրության կենտրոնում [ 34 ] ։ Նա առաջարկել է վերջ տալ քաղաքի 183 կանոնադրական դպրոցների համար քաղաքային տարածքների անվճար վարձակալության քաղաքականությանը և հատարարել մորատորիում`մեկ շենքում կանոնադրական և հանրակրթական դպրոցների համատեղ տեղակայման վերաբերյալ։ 2013 թվականի հոկտեմբերին երթ էր անցկացվել՝ ի պաշտպանություն կանոնադրական դպրոցների, որին

[ 1 ] ​ Desde 2010 hasta 2013 ocupó el cargo de Defensor Público de la ciudad de Nueva York . [ ] El 5 de noviembre de 2013, ganó las elecciones para alcalde, con casi el 73  % de los votos del Partido Demócrata, sustituyendo al también demócrata Michael Bloomberg . Infancia y educación  [ editar ] [ editar ] Es hijo de Maria y Warren Wilhelm. Bautizado como Warren Wilhelm Junior, nació en Manhattan y se crio en Cambridge (Massachusetts). [ 2 ] ​ Tiene dos hermanos mayores: Steven y Donald. [ 3 ] ​ Habla italiano y fue bautizado como católico, pero no es practicante. [ 3 ] ​ Su padre era de origen alemán y sus abuelos maternos, Giovanni y Ana, inmigrantes italianos [ 4 ] ​ [ 5 ] ​ de Sant'Agata de' Goti , provincia de Benevento . [ 6 ] ​ Su madre se graduó del Smith College en 1938 y tenía 44 años cuando él nació. Su abuelo, Donald Wilhelm, es autor graduado de la Universidad de Harvard . [ 3 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Sobre su padre, De Blasio ha declarado que se fue de casa cuando tenía siete años y que, poco después, sus padres se divorciaron. [ 7 ] ​ En 2012 habló de su infancia en una entrevista: [ ] “[Mi papá] era oficial del ejército en la Guerra del Pacífico [y luchó] en muchas batallas muy difíciles, horribles, incluida la de Okinawa … La verdad, yo creo, por lo que se sabe de los veteranos que regresaron, que sufrió mucho física y mentalmente… Era alcohólico, y como mis padres se separaron muy rápido después de que él volviera a casa, me crié con la familia de mi madre”. [ 8 ] ​ En septiembre de 2013, contó que su padre se suicidó en 1979, debido a que sufría un cáncer de pulmón incurable. [ 9 ] ​ [ ] [ ] En 1983, se cambió el nombre a Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm, decisión que explicó en abril de 2012: “Comencé poniendo el nombre en mi diploma, y luego lo escribí con guion legalmente cuando terminé en la Universidad de Nueva York . Luego, pasé a hacerlo cada vez más, hasta que se convirtió en la identidad correcta”. Cuando apareció en la etapa pública en 1990, usaba el nombre Bill de Blasio, ya que en su vida personal lo llamaban "Bill" o “Billy". No se cambió legalmente de nombre hasta 2002, cuando la discrepancia se notó durante una campaña. De Blasio [ 10 ] ​ tiene un Master en Asuntos Internacionales por la Escuela Pública de Asuntos Internacionales de la Universidad de Columbia , uno de los programas de estudio más prestigiosos, donde recibió la calificación B.A. por parte de la Universidad de Nueva York . [ 11 ] ​ En 1981 recibió una beca en Harry S. Truman . [ ] [ ] Temprana carrera política  [ editar ] [ editar ] Su primer trabajo después de la universidad fue en el Programa Urban Fellow para el departamento de Justicia de menores de la ciudad de Nueva York en 1984. [ 12 ] ​ [ 13 ] ​ [ ] [ ] En 1987, poco después de completar la carrera en la Universidad de Columbia, se ofreció voluntario para trabajar como organizador político en el Quixote Center de Maryland. En 1988, viajó con el Quixote Center a Nicaragua durante 10 días para ayudar a distribuir comida y medicina durante la Revolución Sandinista . De Blasio era un férreo defensor del gobierno sandinista, al que la administración Reagan se oponía. Después de volver de Nicaragua, de Blasio se trasladó a la ciudad de Nueva York, donde trabajó para una organización sin ánimo de lucro que se encargaba de proporcionar asistencia médica en Centroamérica. De Blasio siguió apoyando a los sandinistas en su tiempo libre. De hecho, en Nueva York hasta se afilió a un grupo llamado Red de Gran Solidaridad de Nicaragua que mantuvo reuniones y organizaba recogidas de fondos para el partido político sandinista. Bill de Blasio entró en la vida política de Nueva York en 1989, de la mano de David Dinkins , en la campaña para alcalde, para la cual era un coordinador voluntario. [ 14 ] ​ Después de la campaña, de Blasio fue ayudante en el Ayuntamiento de Nueva York . [ 15 ] ​ [ ] [ ] Uno de los miembros de la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos , Charles B. Rangel , seleccionó a de Blasio como gestor de la exitosa campaña de reelección del año 1994. [ 16 ] ​ En 1997, le nombraron Director Regional del Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de los Estados Unidos (HUD) en Nueva York y Nueva Jersey, bajo la administración del presidente Bill Clinton . Como el funcionario con más rango en los tres estados de la HUD, de Blasio dirigió a un pequeño personal ejecutivo y tomó parte para elevar los estándares a los residentes de viviendas de calidad inferior. [ 17 ] ​ [ 18 ] ​ En 1999, fue elegido miembro del Consejo de la escuela pública para el distrito 15 en Brooklyn. [ 19 ] ​ Y en el año 2000 dirigió la acertada campaña para elegir como miembro del Senado de los Estados Unidos a Hillary Rodham Clinton . [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Consejo municipal de Nueva York (2001-2009)  [ editar ] [ editar ] Elecciones [ editar ] [ editar ] En 2001, de Blasio decidió dirigir el distrito 39 del Consejo municipal de Nueva York , que incluye de Brooklyn, el parque Borough, Carroll Gardens (Brooklyn) , la colina Cobble, Kensington, el parque Slope y Windsor Terrace (Brooklyn) . Ganó las elecciones primarias con el 32 % del voto. [ 20 ] ​ En las elecciones generales, derrotó al republicano Robert A. Bell con el 71 %, frente al 17 % de su opositor. [ 21 ] ​ En 2003, ganó la reelección a un segundo mandato con el 72 % de los votos. [ 22 ] ​ Y en el año 2005, ganó la reelección a un tercer mandato con el 83 % de los votos. [ 23 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Mandato [ editar ] [ editar ] En el ayuntamiento, aprobó la legislación para prevenir la discriminación del propietario contra arrendatarios que vivan con SIDA, con subvenciones federales al alojamiento y ayudas al alquilar bajo la Ley de Servicios Sociales, mejorando el servicio de alojamiento para los neoyorquinos de bajos ingresos que viven con SIDA. [ 24 ] ​ [ 25 ] ​ Como jefe del Comité General de Bienestar del Ayuntamiento, ayudó a aprobar la Ley de protección contra la discriminación por género para proteger a los neoyorquinos transgénero e instauró la Ley de reconocimiento de la sociedad doméstica para asegurar que en la ciudad de Nueva York las parejas homosexuales pudieran gozar de las mismas ventajas legales que las heterosexuales en la ciudad de Nueva York.

[ 31 ] ​ [ ] Defensor del Pueblo de la ciudad de Nueva York (2010–2013)  [ editar ] [ editar ] Elecciones [ editar ] [ editar ] En noviembre de 2008, anunció su candidatura a defensor del pueblo, entrando en un terreno lleno de candidatos que compiten por el nombramiento demócrata, incluyendo a Mark J. Green, antiguo Defensor del Pueblo. El New York Times apoyó a de Blasio en un editorial publicado durante las primarias y elogió sus esfuerzos por mejorar lo público: “Ayuda mucho menos a neoyorquinos ricos, con vales de comida, alojamiento y la salud de niños". El editorial continuó diciendo de Bill de Blasio, que era el mejor candidato al puesto "porque había demostrado que puede trabajar bien con el Alcalde Bloomberg cuando tiene sentido hacerlo, y oponerse a él elocuentemente y con vehemencia cuando está justificado”. [ 32 ] ​ [ ] Su candidatura recibió el apoyo del Defensor del Pueblo, Betsy Gotbaum ; el antiguo Alcalde Ed Koch ; el antiguo Gobernador, Mario Cuomo ; y Al Sharpton . [ 33 ] ​ [ ] El 15 de septiembre de 2009, ganó las primarias con el 33 % de los votos demócratas. [ 34 ] ​ Ganó también la segunda vuelta de las primarias el 29 de septiembre de 2009, derrotando a Mark Green con el 62 % frente al 38 %. [ 35 ] ​ El 3 de noviembre de 2009, derrotó al republicano Alex Zablocki con un 78 % frente a un 18 %. [ 36 ] ​ [ 37 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Fue nombrado tercer Defensor del Pueblo de la ciudad de Nueva York el 1 de enero de 2010. En su discurso inaugural, desafió a la administración del Alcalde Michael Bloomberg , criticando la falta de hogares para los indigentes y sus políticas de educación. [ 38 ] ​ [ ] Educación  [ editar ] [ editar ] Como Defensor del Pueblo, criticó repetidamente la política educativa del Alcalde Bloomberg. Llamó a Cathie Black, candidata de la Ciudad de Nueva York para Canciller de colegios del Alcalde Bloomberg, para participar en foros públicos y la criticó por no llevar a sus propios niños a colegios públicos. [ 39 ] ​ [ 40 ] ​ En marzo de 2010, habló en contra de una oferta de la Autoridad Metropolitana del Transporte de Nueva York de eliminar la gratuidad de MetroCards para estudiantes, sosteniendo que la medida aumentaría el precio de la asistencia escolar. [ 41 ] ​ Tres meses más tarde, se opuso al presupuesto presentado por el alcalde, que contenía más de 34 millones de dólares para reducir los servicios de cuidado de los niños. [ 42 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] En junio de 2011, elaboró un plan para mejorar el proceso de coubicación escolar, por lo que múltiples colegios pasaron a alojarse en un solo edificio. Su estudio determinó que el Departamento Educativo del alcalde a menudo ignoraba la entrada de la comunidad y echaba abajo las decisiones tomadas sobre su impacto negativo sin sopesar suficientemente las decisiones. Propuso ocho soluciones para mejorar el proceso e incorporó la opinión de la comunidad constituida en el proceso de toma de decisiones. [ 43 ] ​ El mismo mes, también criticó una propuesta de la administración de Bloomberg para despedir a más de 4.600 profesores para equilibrar el presupuesto de la ciudad, organizando a padres y comunidades contra las propuestas de reducción, y organizó a última hora una call-a-thon. Bloomberg restauró la financiación, buscando dinero en otra partida del presupuesto. [ 44 ] ​ [ ] [ ] Durante su campaña para Alcalde, elaboró un plan para restaurar impuestos a aquellos residentes que ganan más de 500.000 dólares al año, para pagar programas universales de preescolar y ampliar programas después de los estudios secundarios. [ 45 ] ​ [ 46 ] ​ También planeaba invertir 150 millones de dólares anuales en la Universidad de la Ciudad de Nueva York para bajar el precio de la matrícula y mejorar los programas de titulación. [ ] [ ] En septiembre de 2013, se opuso a los colegios subvencionados, alegando que su financiación debilita los recursos de clases después del colegio, como el arte y la educación física. Diseñó un plan de discontinuar la política de ofrecer el espacio sin alquileres a los 183 colegios subvencionados de la ciudad y colocar una moratoria en la ubicación de colegios subvencionados en edificios de la escuela pública. "No favoreceré los colegios subvencionados", declaró de Blasio. "Nuestro objetivo son los colegios públicos tradicionales”. [ 47 ] ​ En octubre de 2013, casi 20.000 manifestantes marcharon a través de Brooklyn Bridge para protestar por la oferta de Bill de Blasio de eliminar las ayudas a los colegios subvencionados. [ 48 ] ​ [ ] [ ] Vivienda [ editar ] [ editar ] En junio de 2010, se opuso a una decisión de la Autoridad de la Vivienda de la Ciudad de Nueva York de recortar el número de vales de la Sección 8 para los neoyorquinos con bajos ingresos. La reducción se anunció después de que el NYCHA descubriese que no podía pagar los aproximadamente 2.600 vales que ya se habían publicado. La Autoridad de la Vivienda de la Ciudad de Nueva York se retractó de su decisión un mes más tarde. [ 49 ] ​ [ ] Dos meses después, expuso a los peores propietarios de la "ciudad de Nueva York en una lista llamada Watchlist" para rastrear a aquellos que no reparaban las viviendas y, por tanto, arriesgaban la vida de otros. La lista dibujó la cobertura informativa extendida y destacó a cientos de propietarios a través de la ciudad. "Queremos que vean que se les observa", declaró de Blasio al Daily News. "Tenemos que sacar sus acciones a la luz pública para avergonzarlos”. [ 50 ] ​ [ ] Fondo de campaña  [ editar ] [ editar ] De Blasio se ha opuesto al Caso Ciudadanos Unidos contra Comisión de Elecciones Federales , sentencia emitida por la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos en enero de 2010 a favor del litigante, la organización conservadora Citizens United , que derribó parte de la reforma parlamentaria de la campaña bipartidista McCain-Feingold de 2002. Alegó que "no se debería permitir a las corporaciones influenciar las elecciones" y algunos funcionarios electos lanzaron una campaña nacional para invertir los efectos del fallo judicial. [ 51 ] ​ [ ] Alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York [ editar ] [ editar ] Elecciones 2013 [ editar ] [ editar ] El 27 de enero de 2013, anunció su candidatura para Alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York en las elecciones de otoño. [ 52 ] ​ [ 53 ] ​ [ ] [ ] A la carrera de las primarias demócratas se incluyeron nueve candidatos, entre ellos Christine Quinn, portavoz del Ayuntamiento; Anthony Weiner, antiguo Representante de la Cámara Baja de los Estados Unidos y antiguo interventor de la ciudad de Nueva York; Bill Thompson, candidato a las elecciones para alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York en 2009. [ 54 ] ​ [ 55 ] ​ Después de que Weiner se afiliase a la carrera de las primarias en abril, las encuestas tempranas mostraron a de Blasio en el cuarto o quinto lugar. [ 56 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] A pesar de esta pobre posición inicial, de Blasio era capaz de ganar la aprobación de los principales clubes demócrata, como Barack Obama , el Club Demócrata de Manhattan Superior, así como, el sindicato más grande de la ciudad de Nueva York, Unión Internacional de empleados del servicio en el local 1199. Los famosos como Alec Baldwin , Sarah Jessica Parker y políticos notables como el ex- Gobernador de Vermont Howard Dean y la Miembro del Congreso estadounidense Yvette Clarke, también dieron su aprobación. [ 57 ] ​ [ 58 ] ​ [ 59 ] ​ En agosto, Harry Belafonte y Susan Sarandon respaldaron a de Blasio. [ 60 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio recibió la atención de los medios de comunicación cuando, durante su campaña, él y una docena de otros políticos, entre ellos Stephen Levin, concejal neoyorquino, se vieron arrestados al protestar contra el cierre del Hospital Universitario de Long Island. [ 61 ] ​ Anthony Weiner, aspirante a alcalde demócrata de la ciudad, y John Liu, interventor de la ciudad, también estaban en la protesta, pero no fueron detenidos. De Blasio y Levin fueron puestos en libertad unas horas más tarde con citaciones judiciales por alteración del orden público. [ 62 ] ​ [ ] [ ] Con el tiempo, de Blasio subió en las encuestas y, a mediados de agosto, por primera vez, una encuesta le mostró tomando la iniciativa demócrata. [ 63 ] ​ Alcanzó el 43 por ciento en una encuesta de Quinnipiac del 3 de septiembre. [ ] Los resultados preliminares mostraron a de Blasio como ganador en las elecciones primarias del 10 de septiembre con el 40.12 % de los votos, ligeramente más del 40 % que tenía que obtener para evitar el desempate. [ 64 ] ​ El 16 de septiembre, el golpe ganador se lo concedió el segundo en las encuestas Bill Thompson, citando la improbabilidad de ganar en el desempate, aun sin contar su ausencia y las votaciones de los militantes empujaran a de Blasio debajo del 40 % necesario. La retirada de Thompson allanó la victoria a de Blasio para hacerse con la candidatura demócrata contra el republicano Joseph J. Lhota en las elecciones generales. [ 65 ] ​ Tras las primarias demócratas, de Blasio se anunció como el candidato en la línea del Partido de Familias Trabajadoras . [ 66 ] ​ [ ] [ ] [ ] En las elecciones generales, de Blasio derrotó a Lhota en una victoria aplastante, ganando con el 72.2 % frente al 24 %. [ 67 ] ​ La asistencia de votantes para las elecciones de 2013 puso un nuevo récord mínimo de votantes certificados sólo un 24 por ciento, que los expertos atribuyeron a la expectativa de la victoria aplastante. [ 68 ] ​ Durante su gobierno, el crimen en Nueva York se redujo a niveles históricamente bajos durante sus cuatro años de gobierno. Además, logró reducir el número de arrestos preventivos que tenían lugar comparado con su predecesor Michael Bloomberg. Las relaciones entre la policía y la comunidad también mejoraron.

( New York , 8 mei 1961 ), is een Amerikaans politicus van de Democratische Partij . Van 1 januari 2014 tot en met 31 december 2021 was hij de burgemeester van New York . Hij was de eerste Democratische burgemeester van de stad sinds 1993. Voordien was hij de Public Advocate van de stad, de ombudsman tussen het kiespubliek en het stadsbestuur. Biografie [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] De Blasio werd geboren als Warren Wilhelm junior, als zoon van Maria de Blasio en Warren Wilhelm, een legerofficier. Zijn vader had Duitse voorouders en zijn moeder was de dochter van Italiaanse immigranten uit Sant'Agata de' Goti (waar de naam 'De Blasio' met een hoofdletter gespeld wordt). Bill de Blasio werd in Manhattan geboren maar groeide op in Cambridge (Massachusetts) . Toen hij acht was, scheidden zijn ouders. Sindsdien groeide hij op bij zijn moeder en haar familie. In 1983 veranderde hij zijn naam officieel naar 'Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm'. Enkele jaren later zou hij de kortere naam 'Bill de Blasio' beginnen te hanteren. Pas in 2002 werd dat ook zijn officiële naam. De Blasio studeerde aan de New York University , waar hij een bachelordiploma haalde, en aan Columbia , waar hij een master in internationale betrekkingen haalde. In 1981 ontving hij een prestigieus Harry S. Truman Scholarship . Begin van zijn carrière  [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] Zijn eerste baan was bij het Urban Fellows Program van het New York City Department of Juvenile Justice in 1984. In 1987, kort na zijn opleiding aan Columbia voltooid te hebben, ging hij aan de slag als politiek organisator voor het Quixote Center in Maryland . In 1988 reisde hij met die organisatie naar Nicaragua om er gedurende tien dagen voedsel en geneesmiddelen uit te delen tijdens de Nicaraguaanse revolutie . De Blasio stond destijds achter de socialistische Sandinisten , terwijl de toenmalige Amerikaanse regering onder leiding van Ronald Reagan hun tegenstanders, de Contra's , steunde. De Blasio verhuisde naar New York, waar hij voor een nonprofit werkte die streefde naar betere gezondheidszorg in Midden-Amerika. Hij zette zijn eerste stappen in de Amerikaanse politiek toen hij zich als vrijwillig coördinator aanmeldde bij het campagneteam van David Dinkins tijdens de burgemeestersverkiezing van 1989. Na de verkiezing kreeg De Blasio een baan in het stadhuis. Daar leerde hij zijn echtgenote, activiste en dichteres Chirlane McCray , kennen. Het stel heeft twee kinderen, Dante en Chiara, en woont in Park Slope ( Brooklyn ). In 1997, tijdens Bill Clintons presidentschap, werd hij aangesteld als regionaal directeur van het ministerie van Volkshuisvesting en Stedelijke Ontwikkeling voor New York en New Jersey . In 1999 werd hij verkozen tot lid van Community School Board 15 . In 2000 was Bill de Blasio Hillary Clintons campagnemanager voor een succesvolle senaatsverkiezing. Gemeenteraadslid [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] In 2001 besloot hij zich kandidaat te stellen namens het 39e district voor de New York City Council . Hij won na een felle strijd de voorverkiezing met 32% van de stemmen en versloeg vervolgens zijn Republikeinse tegenstander met 71% van het stemmentotaal. In 2003 werd hij gemakkelijk herverkozen en in 2005 haalde hij zelfs 83% van de stemmen. Als gemeenteraadslid stelde hij wetgeving op om discriminatie van verhuurders tegen inwoners met federale woonsubsidies tegen te gaan. Hij zette zich ook in voor een wet die New Yorkers met een laag inkomen en met hiv of aids betere woonmogelijkheden biedt. Als hoofd van de commissie algemeen welzijn schaarde hij zich achter een wet tegen de discriminatie van transgenders en wist hij een wet goed te keuren die wettelijk samenwonende homoseksuele stellen dezelfde wettelijke voordelen geeft als heteroseksuele stellen. De commissie keurde tijdens De Blasio's termijn ook een wet goed die de toegang tot overheidsdiensten moet vergemakkelijken voor niet-Engelstalige New Yorkers. Public Advocate [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] Op 3 november 2009 werd hij verkozen tot Public Advocate van de stad New York. Deze functie oefende hij uit van 1 januari 2010 tot 31 december 2013. Dit ambt dient als rechtstreekse link tussen het kiespubliek (de inwoners) en het stadsbestuur. Gedurende zijn ambtstermijn bekritiseerde De Blasio vooral het onderwijs- en huisvestingsbeleid van toenmalig burgemeester Michael Bloomberg . Burgemeester [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] [ bewerken | brontekst bewerken ] Bill de Blasio werd bij de burgemeestersverkiezingen van 2013 verkozen tot burgemeester van New York als opvolger van Michael Bloomberg. Hij won in de voorverkiezingen van onder anderen Bill Thompson, Christine Quinn, John Liu en Anthony Weiner en nam het in de eigenlijke verkiezing op tegen de Republikein Joe Lhota . De Blasio behaalde ruim 73% van het stemmentotaal. Hij werd op 1 januari 2014 even na middernacht beëdigd als 109e burgemeester van New York. Daarmee kreeg de stad voor het eerst in twintig jaar weer een Democraat als burgemeester. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Bij de burgemeestersverkiezingen van 2017 nam De Blasio het op tegen de Republikeinse kandidaat Nicole Malliotakis en werd hij met ruim 66% van de stemmen herkozen. Zijn tweede termijn liep tot en met 31 december 2021. Hij werd opgevolgd door Eric Adams .

On Wikipedia, a stub is a short article . When writers begin a new article, they use the word stub to mean that it is still very short and that people can add a lot more useful information to it. Generally, articles with less than 1500 characters of text are called stubs here. If a stub has little verifiable information , or if its subject has no apparent notability , it may be deleted or be merged into another relevant article. Stub alert!    If you make or find a stub, here is what you should do. You can make the article better, or if you think that someone else would do a better job, add the {{ stub }} template to ask other users to make the article longer. The template will show this message on the page: {{ }}  adding to it See Wikipedia:Template messages for more information. However, stubs should not have {{ stub }} on them for a long time. They should be categorized (put into) into stub categories. See Wikipedia:Simple Stub Project for more information. {{ }} Finding stubs   The MediaWiki software can make finding stubs easy for you.  To make it do this, set the Threshold for stub display higher than 0. This makes it easy to find or fix (make into a longer article) a stub. See Special:Preferences to set your threshold, or Help:User preferences for more help on this and other settings. To find a stub, use the following link to see what links to this page; Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stub (for older stubs) Special:ShortPages (sometimes, the article has not been marked a stub) You can also check Category:Stubs and the subcategories there to find articles that have been marked as stubs. Making stubs better   Most stubs are only one paragraph or sometimes they are only a few lines. Stubs do not fully describe the subject of the article. Make a "This is a stub" message by adding {{ stub }} (see Wikipedia:Template messages for more). This will tell people who read the article that more work needs to be done. Some people watch the New Changes page, but adding the message will tell more people. {{ }} Write in Simple English. Use complete sentences. If you can easily read English that is not simple (for example, if English is your first language), you may want to look at the article on the main English Wikipedia and make a simple version of that article on this Wikipedia. Give a good definition or description of your topic. For biographies and articles about non-concepts (e.g., about countries and cities), definitions are impossible, so begin with a clear, helpful, informative description of the subject. For articles or stubs about a person, tell what they are famous for. For a place, tell where it is and what it is known for. For an event, tell what it was and when it happened. A good definition or description may encourage contributors by suggesting the limits of the article, indirectly summarizing what needs to be done. For example, Salvador Allende was the President of Chile from 1970 until 1973 would be a good description. Try to give more than just a definition — at least a little more. It does not hurt to be provocative, as long as you attempt to have a neutral point of view and be reasonably accurate. What is interesting and important about the subject? If your introduction would make someone want to read more, then it will probably encourage someone to write more. As little as one extra sentence can turn a good description into a great stub, e.g. Salvador Allende was the President of Chile from 1970 until 1973. The CIA might have been involved in the military revolt that put him out of government. You do not have to know any more yourself; many people will be very eager to fill in the details. Make sure any relevant linkable words have been linked, but be careful about which words you link; see Wikipedia:Naming conventions . e.g. Salvador Allende was the President of Chile from 1970 until 1973.  The CIA might have been involved in the  military revolt that put him out of government. Save the article with a change summary that will attract the attention of others to your stub. Be responsible for your stub article. If nobody contributes to your stub for a few weeks, try to make it better yourself. Take the fact that nobody has contributed as a hint that your stub might not have been that great, and if nothing else, try to make it a better stub.

University ( MIA )    Bill de Blasio ( / d ɪ ˈ b l ɑː z i oʊ / ; born Warren Wilhelm Jr. , May 8, 1961; later Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm ) is an American politician who was the 109th mayor of New York City from 2014 to 2021. A member of the Democratic Party , he held the office of New York City Public Advocate from 2010 to 2013. / d ɪ ˈ b l ɑː z i oʊ / / d ɪ ˈ b l ɑː z i oʊ / d ɪ ˈ b l ɑː z i oʊ d ɪ ˈ b l ɑː z i oʊ De Blasio was born in Manhattan and raised primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts . [ 1 ] He graduated from New York University and Columbia University before brief stints working as a campaign manager for Charles Rangel and Hillary Clinton . De Blasio started his career as an elected official on the New York City Council , representing the 39th district in Brooklyn from 2002 to 2009. After one term as public advocate, he was elected mayor of New York City in 2013 and reelected in 2017 . [ ] De Blasio's policy initiatives included new de-escalation training for police officers, reduced prosecutions for cannabis possession , implementation of police body cameras , and ending the post- 9/11 surveillance program of Muslim residents. In his first term as mayor, he implemented a free universal pre-kindergarten program in the city. De Blasio called attention to what he calls stark economic inequality in New York City, which he described as a " tale of two cities " during his first campaign. He supported socially liberal and progressive policies in regard to the city's economy , urban planning, public education, police relations, and privatization . De Blasio ran in the Democratic primaries for the 2020 presidential election . After registering low poll numbers and failing to qualify for the third round of primary debates, he suspended his campaign on September 20, 2019, and endorsed Bernie Sanders five months later. De Blasio was term-limited and ineligible to seek a third term in the 2021 New York City mayoral election . He was succeeded by Eric Adams on January 1, 2022. On May 20, 2022, he announced he was running in the 2022 U.S. House election in the newly redrawn 10th congressional district . [ 2 ] He withdrew from the race on July 19, saying he was done with "electoral politics". [ 3 ] [ ] [ ] Early life, family and education  Bill de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. on May 8, 1961. While he did not grow up in New York City, his parents drove from their home in Norwalk, Connecticut , to Manhattan 's Doctors Hospital for his birth. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] He is the third son of Maria Angela ( née de Blasio ; 1917–2007) and Warren Wilhelm (1917–1979). [ 5 ] He changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm in 1983 and to Bill de Blasio in 2001 to honor his maternal family and to reflect his alienation from his father. [ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] De Blasio has two older brothers, Steven and Donald. [ 4 ] His mother was of Italian heritage, and his father was of German, English, French, and Scots-Irish ancestry. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] His paternal grandparents were Donald Wilhelm, of Ohio, and Nina (née Warren), of Iowa . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] His maternal grandfather, Giovanni, was from Sant'Agata de' Goti , Benevento , and his grandmother, Anna (née Briganti), was from Grassano , Matera . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] His paternal uncle, Donald George Wilhelm Jr., worked for the Central Intelligence Agency in Iran and ghostwrote the memoir of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the last shah of Iran. [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] née de Blasio [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] His mother, Maria de Blasio, attended Smith College , served in the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II and authored The Other Italy: The Italian Resistance in World War II (1988). [ 9 ] [ 15 ] His father, a Yale University graduate, worked as a contributing editor at Time magazine. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. During the 82-day Battle of Okinawa , a grenade detonated below his left foot, and his leg was later amputated below the knee. After receiving a Purple Heart , he married Maria in 1945, and became a budget analyst for the federal government. During the 1950s, at the height of the Red Scare , both Maria and Warren were accused of having a "sympathetic interest in Communism ". The family moved to Connecticut; Warren was chief international economist for Texaco and Maria worked in public relations at the Italian consulate. [ 1 ] [ 16 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In 1966, the family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts , when Warren was offered a job at Arthur D. Little, [ 1 ] and de Blasio began kindergarten. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Bill and his brother Donald were then raised by Maria and her extended family. Of his early childhood, de Blasio said, "my mother and father broke up very early on in the time I came along, and I was brought up by my mother's family—that's the bottom line—the de Blasio family." [ 7 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] When de Blasio was 18, his father committed suicide while suffering from incurable lung cancer . [ 19 ] In 1979, de Blasio graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School , where he was in student government and was known to peers as "Senator Provolone". [ a ] [ 17 ] He received a Bachelor of Arts from New York University in metropolitan studies, a program in urban studies , and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University 's School of International and Public Affairs . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] He is a 1981 Harry S. Truman Scholar . [ 23 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early career In 1984, de Blasio worked for the Urban Fellows Program at the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice . [ 24 ] In 1987, shortly after completing graduate school at Columbia, de Blasio was hired to work as a political organizer by the Quixote Center in Maryland . In 1988, he traveled with the Quixote Center to Nicaragua for 10 days to help distribute food and medicine during the Nicaraguan Revolution . De Blasio was an ardent supporter of the ruling socialist government, the Sandinista National Liberation Front , which was opposed by the Reagan administration at the time. [ 24 ] After returning from Nicaragua, de Blasio moved to New York City, where he worked for a nonprofit organization focused on improving health care in Central America. [ 24 ] He continued to support the Sandinistas in his spare time and joined a group called the Nicaragua Solidarity Network of Greater New York, which held meetings and fundraisers for the Sandinista political party. [ 24 ] De Blasio's introduction to city politics came in 1989, when he worked as a volunteer coordinator for David Dinkins ' mayoral campaign . [ 25 ] Following the campaign, de Blasio was an aide in City Hall . [ 26 ] [ 25 ] In 1990, he described himself as an advocate for democratic socialism when asked about his goals for society. [ 24 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] U.S. Representative Charles Rangel tapped de Blasio to be his campaign manager for his successful 1994 reelection bid. [ 27 ] In 1997, he was appointed to be the regional director for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for New York and New Jersey under the administration of President Bill Clinton . As the tri-state region's highest-ranking HUD official, de Blasio led a small executive staff and took part in outreach to residents of substandard housing. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 1999, he was elected to be a school board member for Brooklyn School District 15. [ 30 ] In 2000, he was campaign manager for Hillary Clinton 's successful United States Senate bid . [ 30 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] New York City Council (2002–2009)  Elections In 2001, de Blasio ran for the New York City Council 's 39th district, which includes the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park , Carroll Gardens , Cobble Hill , Gowanus , Kensington , Park Slope , and Windsor Terrace . He won the crowded primary election with 32% of the vote. [ 31 ] In the general election, he defeated Republican Robert A. Bell, 71% to 17%. [ 32 ] He was reelected with 72% of the vote in 2003 [ 33 ] and with 83% of the vote in 2005. [ 34 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Tenure On the City Council, de Blasio passed legislation to prevent landlord discrimination against tenants who hold federal housing subsidy vouchers, and helped pass the HIV/AIDS Housing Services Law, improving housing services for low-income New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] As head of the city council's General Welfare Committee, de Blasio helped pass the Gender-Based Discrimination Protection Law to protect transgender New Yorkers, and passed the Domestic Partnership Recognition Law to ensure that same-sex couples in a legal partnership could enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual couples in New York City. [ 37 ] During his tenure, the General Welfare Committee also passed the Benefits Translation for Immigrants Law, which helped non-English speakers receive free language-assistance services when accessing government programs. [ 38 ] He was on the education, environmental protection , finance, and technology committees and chaired the general welfare committee. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] New York City Public Advocate (2010–2013)  2009 election   In November 2008, de Blasio announced his candidacy for New York City Public Advocate , entering a crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic nomination that included former Public Advocate Mark Green . The New York Times endorsed de Blasio, praising his efforts to improve public schools and "[help] many less-fortunate New Yorkers with food stamps, housing, and children's health" as a councilmember. The paper declared de Blasio the best candidate for the job "because he has shown that he can work well with Mayor Bloomberg when it makes sense to do so while vehemently and eloquently opposing him when justified." [ 44 ] His candidacy was endorsed by then Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum , former Mayor Ed Koch , former Governor Mario Cuomo , and Reverend Al Sharpton . [ 45 ] [ ] [ ] On September 15, 2009, de Blasio finished first in the Democratic primary, garnering 33% of the vote. [ 46 ] He won the runoff primary election on September 29, defeating Green, 62% to 38%. [ 47 ] In the November 3 general election, de Blasio defeated Republican Alex Zablocki , 78% to 18%. [ 48 ] De Blasio was inaugurated as New York City's third Public Advocate on January 1, 2010. In his inauguration speech he criticized the Bloomberg administration, especially its homelessness and education policies. [ 49 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Tenure Affordable housing In June 2010, de Blasio opposed a New York City Housing Authority decision to cut the number of Section 8 vouchers issued to low-income New Yorkers. The cut was announced after the NYCHA discovered it could not pay for approximately 2,600 vouchers that had already been issued. [ 50 ] Two months later, he launched an online "NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist" to track landlords who failed to repair dangerous living conditions. The list drew widespread media coverage and highlighted hundreds of landlords across the city. "We want these landlords to feel like they're being watched", de Blasio told the New York Daily News . "We need to shine a light on these folks to shame them into action." [ 51 ] [ ] [ ] Campaign finance De Blasio has criticized Citizens United , the January 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned parts of the 2002 McCain–Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act . He argued that "corporations should not be allowed to buy elections" and launched a national campaign by elected officials to reverse the decision's effects. [ 52 ] [ ] Education As public advocate, de Blasio repeatedly criticized Bloomberg's education policies. He called for Cathie Black , Bloomberg's nominee for New York City Schools Chancellor , to take part in public forums and criticized her for sending her own children to private schools. [ 53 ] In March 2010, he spoke against an MTA proposal to eliminate free MetroCards for students, arguing the measure would take a significant toll on school attendance. [ 54 ] Three months later, he voiced opposition to the mayor's proposed budget containing more than $34 million in cuts to childcare services. [ 55 ] In June 2011, de Blasio outlined a plan to improve the process of school co-location, by which multiple schools are housed in one building. His study found community input was often ignored by the city's Department of Education, resulting in top-down decisions made without sufficient regard for negative impacts. He outlined eight solutions to improve the process and incorporate community opinion into the decision-making process. [ 56 ] The same month, he also criticized a Bloomberg administration proposal to lay off more than 4,600 teachers to balance the city's budget; de Blasio organized parents and communities against the proposed cuts and staged a last-minute call-a-thon. Bloomberg restored the funding, agreeing to find savings elsewhere in the budget. [ 57 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Mayor of New York City (2014–2021)  2013 election On January 27, 2013, de Blasio announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City in the fall election . [ 58 ] The Democratic primary race included nine candidates, among them Council Speaker Christine Quinn , former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner , and former New York City Comptroller and 2009 mayoral nominee Bill Thompson . [ 59 ] After Weiner joined the race in April, early polls showed de Blasio in fourth or fifth place. [ 60 ] Despite his poor starting position, de Blasio gained the endorsements of major Democratic clubs, such as the Barack Obama Democratic Club of Upper Manhattan , and New York City's largest trade union , SEIU Local 1199 . Celebrities such as Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker endorsed him, as did prominent politicians such as former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and U.S. Congresswoman Yvette Clarke . [ 61 ] By August, singer Harry Belafonte and actress Susan Sarandon had also endorsed de Blasio. [ 62 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio gained media attention during the campaign when he and a dozen others, including city councillor Stephen Levin , were arrested while protesting the closing of Long Island College Hospital . [ 63 ] De Blasio and Levin were released a few hours later with disorderly conduct summonses. Fellow Democratic mayoral hopefuls Weiner and City Comptroller John Liu were also at the protest but were not arrested. [ 64 ] [ ] [ ] During his mayoral campaign, de Blasio outlined a plan to raise taxes on residents earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal pre-kindergarten programs and to expand after-school programs at middle schools . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] He also pledged to invest $150 million annually into the City University of New York to lower tuition and improve degree programs. [ 66 ] In September 2013, de Blasio voiced his opposition to charter schools , maintaining that their funding saps resources from classes like art, physical education and after-school programs. He outlined a plan to discontinue the policy of offering rent-free space to the city's 183 charter schools and to place a moratorium on the co-location of charter schools in public school buildings. [ 67 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In August 2013, the de Blasio campaign released a television advertisement featuring de Blasio's then-15-year-old son, Dante, talking about his father's plans to "'really break from the Bloomberg years.'" [ 68 ] Time called it "The Ad That Won the New York Mayor's Race", noting that after it ran, "de Blasio built a steady lead that he never relinquished." [ 68 ] [ ] [ ] Quinn was attacked by a number of groups including NYCLASS with their "Anybody But Quinn" campaign, allowing de Blasio to move up in the polls. By mid-August, he emerged as the new leader among the Democrats. [ 69 ] He reached 43% in a Quinnipiac poll released a week before the primary. [ 70 ] [ ] [ ] Preliminary results of the September 11 primary showed de Blasio with 40.1% of the votes, slightly more than the 40% needed to avoid a runoff. [ 71 ] On September 16, second-place finisher Bill Thompson conceded the race, citing the unlikelihood of winning a runoff even if uncounted absentee and military ballots pushed de Blasio below the 40% threshold. Thompson's withdrawal made de Blasio the Democratic mayoral nominee. [ 72 ] Exit polls showed that the issue that most aided de Blasio's primary victory was his unequivocal opposition to "stop and frisk." [ 73 ] After the primary, de Blasio was announced as the nominee of the Working Families Party . [ 74 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In the general election, de Blasio faced Republican candidate Joe Lhota . [ 72 ] On Election Day, de Blasio defeated Lhota in a landslide, receiving 72.2% of the vote. [ 75 ] Voter turnout for the election set a new record low of only 24% of registered voters, which The New York Times attributed to the expectation of a landslide in the heavily Democratic city. [ 76 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The finance activities of the 2013 de Blasio campaign became the subject of a federal corruption investigation led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara , including whether campaign donors received preferential treatment from City Hall. [ 77 ] The investigation ended in March 2017 with no charges being filed. [ citation needed ] [ ] citation needed 2017 election In 2017, de Blasio won reelection to a second term, defeating Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis , 65.2%-27.2%. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ ] [ ] Tenure De Blasio was sworn into office on January 1, 2014, by former President Bill Clinton . In his inaugural address, he reiterated his campaign pledge to address "economic and social inequalities" within the city. [ 80 ] The New York Times noted that "The elevation of an assertive, tax-the-rich liberal to the nation's most prominent municipal office has fanned hopes that hot-button causes like universal prekindergarten and low-wage worker benefits... could be aided by the imprimatur of being proved workable in New York." [ 81 ] [ ] [ ] In the first weeks of de Blasio's mayoralty, New York City was struck by a series of snowstorms. [ 82 ] De Blasio was criticized by Upper East Side residents who said efforts to clear the snow seemed to be lagging in their neighborhood. [ 83 ] De Blasio apologized the next day, saying that "more could have been done to serve the Upper East Side." [ 83 ] On February 13, heavy snowstorms hit the East Coast again. Under instructions from De Blasio and School Chancellor Carmen Fariña , the city's public schools were kept open. This decision was criticized by teacher unions, parents and the media as 9.5 inches of snow fell that day. [ 84 ] By the middle of February, the city had added $35 million to the Sanitation Department 's budget for snow removal. [ 82 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In July 2014, de Blasio signed a bill authorizing the creation of municipal identification cards for all residents regardless of immigration status, to help secure access to city services. [ 85 ] Homeless New Yorkers were also eligible to obtain the IDNYC cards if they registered a "care of" address. The IDNYC card program was launched on January 1, 2015. [ 86 ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio had mixed approval ratings during his mayoralty. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 9/11 attacks  In 2016, de Blasio expressed support for the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act that would allow relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for its government's alleged role in the attacks . [ 90 ] [ ] Affordable housing A key focus of de Blasio's mayoral tenure was to build more affordable housing, with a goal of 200,000 units. [ 91 ] His plan passed the City Council, [ 92 ] but was controversial. Groups such as the New York Communities for Change came out against the plan, arguing that it promoted gentrification . [ 93 ] In April 2017, the state government renewed the 421-a tax abatement program after unions and developers made a deal on wages in qualifying construction projects. [ 94 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Atlantic Avenue , in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn , which has been scarred by decades of poverty and crime, was the first test and focus of de Blasio's strategy on affordable housing, one of the policy initiatives central to his platform of reducing inequality. Since 2012, city planners had been working to bring residents to forums to consult on the process. The plan was to "invite developers to build up local streets in exchange for more units of affordable housing." [ 95 ] [ ] In January 2019, de Blasio and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson reached an agreement to change the operations of the New York City Housing Authority. The agreement created "specific requirements and milestones to address the serious health and safety hazards at NYCHA properties, including lead-based paint, mold, heat, vermin, among others". [ 96 ] [ ] Alicia Glen was de Blasio's deputy mayor for economic development and housing. [ 97 ] [ ] COVID-19 response On January 28, 2020, de Blasio said, "this virus was underestimated by the Chinese government . It was actually beginning to spread and was not recognized sufficiently and talked about openly." [ 98 ] [ 99 ] On February 13, in an interview with NBC News , he said, "this is something we can handle, but you got to follow some basic rules." [ 98 ] On March 2, de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers in a tweet "to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus". [ 100 ] [ 101 ] On March 9, he said that the "vast majority of New Yorkers, being folks under 50 and healthy, are not in particular danger, and if they were to get it, would experience something like a common cold or flu." [ 102 ] On March 11, he was "telling people to not avoid restaurants, not avoid normal things that people do. ... If you're not sick, you should be going about your life." [ 98 ] [ 103 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] On March 16, The New York Times reported that during the previous week, de Blasio's "top aides were furiously trying to change the mayor's approach to the coronavirus outbreak. There had been arguments and shouting matches between the mayor and some of his advisers; some top health officials had even threatened to resign if he refused to accept the need to close schools and businesses." 
De Blasio followed their advice. [ 104 ] [ ] De Blasio was criticized for singling out Jewish residents of the city, following tweets directed at "the Jewish community", who described de Blasio's actions as scapegoating . [ 105 ] In early June 2020, he was criticized for enforcing restrictions on religious gatherings to no more than 25% of capacity whereas all other groups were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. [ 106 ] Catholic priests and Jewish synagogue worshipers then sued both De Blasio and Governor Cuomo for being more than twice as restrictive of worship than protest events. [ 107 ] In late June, a federal judge overruled the religious worship restrictions and others that limited New York outdoor gatherings. [ 108 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] When Brian Lehrer asked De Blasio in a July 2020 radio interview about his approach to helping businesses recover from the pandemic, de Blasio said that his "focus has not been on the business community and the elite", and, quoting Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto , that "the state is the executive committee of the bourgeoisie." He quoted Ché Guevara , another communist figure, at a rally in Miami a year earlier, upsetting that city's Latino community. [ 109 ] [ ] Charter schools In 2014, De Blasio's decision to deny public space to several New York City charter schools provoked controversy among advocates of school vouchers . [ 110 ] The decision overturned a Bloomberg administration arrangement that allowed for "co-locations", where charter schools were housed in public school buildings. [ 111 ] De Blasio also revoked $200 million of capital funding earmarked for charter schools. [ 112 ] The New York Times emphasized that de Blasio approved 14 charter school co-locations and only denied three, suggesting that he was being unfairly cast as being opposed to charter schools. [ 113 ] Two months after the initial decision, the mayor's office announced that it had found space for the three schools. The city would lease, renovate, and maintain three buildings, which were previously used for Catholic schools, from the Archdiocese of New York . The three charter schools are run by Success Academy Charter Schools . [ 114 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Environmental issues In April 2019, De Blasio announced his support for the Green New Deal and for legislation to ban the construction of glass and steel skyscrapers in New York City, citing environmental concerns and feeling they contribute to global warming. [ 115 ] He also criticized the development at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. [ 116 ] [ ] [ ] George Floyd riots and protests On May 31, 2020, de Blasio issued a statement blaming protesters for being in the way of two police cruisers that pushed a barricade into them. [ 117 ] On June 7, 2020, he announced: "We will be moving funding from the NYPD to youth initiatives and social services." [ 118 ] De Blasio blamed "anarchist" protesters for inciting and organizing violent riots. [ 119 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] On June 21, 2020, the American Museum of Natural History announced that it was asking city officials to remove the Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt with a Native American man and an African man standing next to the horse. De Blasio endorsed the decision. [ 120 ] [ ] Israel On February 14, 2019, while addressing a rally in New York City about combating antisemitism , De Blasio said: "Maybe some people don't realize it, but when they support the BDS movement, they are affronting the right of Israel to exist and that is unacceptable." [ 121 ] De Blasio condemned Representative Ilhan Omar 's remarks about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists as "absolutely unacceptable" and "illogical". [ 122 ] [ ] [ ] Marijuana legalization In December 2018, De Blasio announced his support for marijuana legalization in New York City, calling it a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to get a historic issue right for future New Yorkers." [ 123 ] He worked with a marijuana task force to produce a report on licensing and regulation, which was released along with a letter of endorsement. [ 124 ] [ ] [ ] Mohel disclosure rule In 2015, de Blasio repealed a public health requirement that mohels inform parents of the risks of metzitzah b'peh , an oral circumcision ritual that was linked to 17 cases of infant herpes, brain damage, and two deaths since 2000. [ 125 ] In 2012, the rule was passed by the city's Board of Health, which required parents to sign a consent form. [ 126 ] Some ultra- Orthodox Jewish leaders called the requirement an infringement on religious freedom, sued the city in federal court, [ 125 ] and pressed their followers not to comply. [ 127 ] After de Blasio installed allies and donors on New York City's Board of Health, a new policy was instated that mohels could be banned for life if they tested positive for herpes and the DNA strain matched the infant's, but only after a child was infected. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] It was soon revealed that the city was not disclosing new infections as required by the new policy, [ 130 ] and children continued to become infected after undergoing the ritual. [ 131 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Nepotism laws De Blasio put his wife, Chirlane McCray, in charge of major policy initiatives such as the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and ThriveNYC (a $850 million mental health initiative). This caused criticism since McCray had never been elected to office and was chosen for these positions only because of her relationship with De Blasio. De Blasio accused critics of the arrangement of "sexism" and bemoaned the city's anti- nepotism laws that prevented McCray from receiving a substantial salary. [ 132 ] [ ] NYPD relations During his mayoral tenure, de Blasio's relationship with the New York City Police Department was called "strained", [ 133 ] "combative", [ 134 ] and "frosty". [ 135 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Ending the NYPD's "stop and frisk" policy was a centerpiece of De Blasio's campaign. [ 136 ] The practice had been challenged by civil rights groups in federal court, where it was ruled unconstitutional in 2013 . The federal appeal of this decision filed by the Bloomberg administration was dropped by de Blasio upon taking office. He vowed to settle cases with claimants who had ongoing litigation against the police for stop and frisk arrests. The NYPD union appealed the decision without de Blasio's support, and was rejected. [ 137 ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio selected Bill Bratton for New York City Police Commissioner , a position he had held under Mayor Rudy Giuliani . Bratton, who introduced stop and frisk under Giuliani, promised it would be used "legally, respectfully" and less frequently. [ 138 ] Some de Blasio supporters were disappointed by Bratton's appointment. [ 139 ] [ ] [ ] In February 2014, Pastor Bishop Orlando Findlayter—the founder of the New Hope Christian Fellowship Church, and a friend and supporter of de Blasio—was pulled over for failing to signal before making a left turn. Findlayter was then detained by police on outstanding warrants and driving with a suspended license. [ 140 ] De Blasio is alleged to have called the police on Findlayter's behalf. Findlayter was released shortly thereafter. In a press conference, de Blasio told reporters that while he had called the police to make an inquiry regarding Findlayter's arrest he did not ask the police to release him. [ 141 ] A spokesperson for the mayor said that de Blasio's call occurred after the police already had decided to release Findlayter. [ 140 ] While both the police and City Hall denied that De Blasio requested preferential treatment for Findlayter, City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer said De Blasio's behavior was concerning because "the mayor shouldn't be involved in any way about somebody's arrest." [ 142 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] On December 3, 2014, after a grand jury decided not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner , de Blasio said in a speech that he and his African American wife, Chirlane McCray , had had many conversations with their biracial son about taking "special care in any encounters he has with the police officers who are there to protect him". [ 143 ] De Blasio also "offered qualified support for protesters after the grand jury decision not to charge the officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City". [ 144 ] [ ] [ ] After New York City police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed in an ambush in December 2014, "cops and union leaders publicly rebuked [de Blasio], arguing [that] his earlier remarks had stoked anti-police sentiment." [ 133 ] When de Blasio eulogized the two fallen officers, hundreds of their fellow police officers turned their backs on him. [ 144 ] [ ] [ ] After the murder of New York City police officer Miosotis Familia in July 2017, de Blasio received further criticism for not attending Familia's vigil. Many officers again turned their backs on him when he spoke at a service for Familia. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ ] [ ] In November 2019, de Blasio criticized former mayor Michael Bloomberg's apology for the stop and frisk policy, tweeting, "This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical. With all due respect to my predecessor, we've spent six years undoing the damage he created with this bankrupt policy. We ended stop and frisk AND drove down crime. Actions speak louder than words." [ 147 ] Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch joined the Mayor in criticizing Bloomberg's apology as well. [ 148 ] [ ] [ ] Pizza controversy On 10 January 2014, the mayor received light-hearted criticism after a photoshoot where he ate a pizza with a knife and fork at a Staten Island pizzeria. In defense, de Blasio claimed that it was traditional in Italy to eat pizza in such a manner. Marc Cosentino, the owner of the pizzeria, later auctioned off the notorious fork for $2,500 to raise money for the Tunnel to Towers Foundation . The controversy was variously dubbed "Forkgate", "Pizzagate", and "Pizzaghazi". [ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Technology and innovation When de Blasio appointed Minerva Tantoco as the city's chief technology officer in fall 2014, he said her goal would be to "develop and implement a coordinated strategy for technology and innovation, for how this city as a whole is going to approach the role of technology in our everyday lives, in our economy, in our schools, in our civic participation." [ 153 ] Two years later, Tantoco's efforts were only partially successful. [ 154 ] [ ] [ ] Along with Governor Cuomo, de Blasio supported moving Amazon 's headquarters to Long Island City in the Amazon HQ2 search, and worked with Cuomo to develop a benefits package from New York City and State funds totaling $2.988 billion. [ 155 ] In November 2018, Long Island City in Queens was selected as one of two sites for HQ2, along with Crystal City in Arlington County, Virginia , outside of Washington, D.C. [ 155 ] Long Island City's selection as a site for Amazon's HQ2 was controversial before and after it happened, and was protested by local residents, community organizations, and politicians. After receiving pushback, Amazon withdrew its plans to open HQ2 in Long Island City on February 14, 2019. [ 156 ] De Blasio criticized Amazon's decision. [ 156 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Transportation In 2014, de Blasio released a report dedicated to "better transit for New York City." Some of the ideas brought up in the report were to rebuild Penn Station / Madison Square Garden , create more bus rapid transit routes, [ 157 ] and a "Vision Zero" initiative to reduce traffic-related deaths in the city. [ 158 ] [ ] [ ] The "Vision Zero" initiative, inspired by a successful Swedish plan, saw a gradual decrease in pedestrian fatalities, from 299 in 2013 to 200 in 2018. [ 159 ] But in 2019 there was an increase in cyclist deaths, and de Blasio discussed several proposals to combat cyclist deaths, including a $58.4 million plan [ 160 ] and requiring cyclists to wear helmets and acquire licenses to operate a bicycle. [ 161 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] While the de Blasio administration planned on increasing the rate at which bicycle racks were added in the city, the annual rate instead fell by 42% compared to the Bloomberg administration, reaching a new average of 1,633 new racks per year. [ 162 ] Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said, "Everybody's talking about Citi Bikes and scooters but it's the humble bike rack that needs more attention." [ 162 ] [ ] [ ] Universal pre-kindergarten As mayor, de Blasio's signature initiative was the implementation of Universal Pre-K , i.e. publicly funded pre-kindergarten for all New York City residents. [ 163 ] He sought to fund the program by increasing taxes on New York City residents earning $500,000 or more. [ 164 ] De Blasio's initiative saw an increase in Universal Pre-K enrollment in New York City through 2015, with over 70% of pre-K expansions happening within the ZIP codes of the city's poorest quartile. [ 165 ] In 2017, de Blasio proposed an expansion of the program to "3-K", to include three-year-olds. Preschool for three-year-olds would start in poorer neighborhoods, with the goal of covering the entire city, if the state or federal governments provided funding. [ 166 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 2020 presidential campaign   2020 presidential election ( Democratic Party primaries ) Bill de Blasio Mayor of New York City (2014–2021) Democratic Party Inactive May 16, 2019 September 20, 2019 New York City, New York US$1,417,609.97 [ 167 ] (9/30/2019) US$1,417,609.97 [ 167 ] [ ] Working People First [ 168 ] [ ] billdeblasio.com (archived - August 2, 2019) On May 16, 2019, de Blasio announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president after releasing a YouTube video in which he said, "I'm Bill de Blasio, and I'm running for president because it's time we put working people first." [ 168 ] He was the first incumbent mayor of New York City to run for president since John Lindsay , who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1972 . [ 169 ] [ ] [ ] During his campaign, de Blasio expressed support for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. [ 168 ] On June 19, 2019, he said, "We have to make sure there is a peace settlement in Afghanistan; it obviously has to involve the Taliban . Until that point, I don't think it's sensible to take out our troops." [ 170 ] De Blasio advocated a robot tax and proposed to make large corporations responsible for five years of income tax from jobs that are automated away. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Despite his large margins of victory during his mayoral races, polls found de Blasio to be widely unpopular. The New York Times described his candidacy as a "long shot", citing his low national poll numbers and inconsistent approval ratings in New York City. [ 173 ] An April 2019 poll found his approval rating at 42% in the city, with 44% of voters disapproving. [ 174 ] A May 2019 Quinnipiac University poll of New York City voters found that 76% did not want de Blasio to run for president. [ 175 ] Just before he suspended his campaign, his approval rating had dropped to 33%, with 58% disapproving. [ 176 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] De Blasio attempted to position himself as a progressive in contrast to the at-the-time front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden . He was hoping to challenge U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , both of whom were seen as leaders of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. [ 177 ] [ ] De Blasio's campaign failed to gain traction. He was unable to qualify for Democratic primary debates in September and October, which were seen as necessary events for his campaign to maintain viability. He regularly polled at 0% among Democratic primary voters, including in his home state. [ 178 ] After failing to qualify for the third round of primary debates, [ 179 ] de Blasio announced the suspension of his campaign on September 20, 2019. [ 177 ] [ 180 ] On February 14, 2020, de Blasio endorsed Sanders. [ 181 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In May 2019, de Blasio consulted with New York City's Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB) to ask if he could bill the city for an NYPD security detail while campaigning. The COIB warned de Blasio at the time against billing taxpayers for travel expenses incurred by the security detail. De Blasio ultimately went on 31 out-of-state trips while campaigning, racking up $319,747 in travel costs which he billed to New York City. [ 182 ] In October 2021, the New York City Department of Investigations published a report with findings that "the City has not been reimbursed by the de Blasio Campaign for the travel expenses of the security detail during the Mayor's presidential campaign, totaling over $300,000." [ 183 ] In June 2023, the COIB ordered de Blasio to repay the $319,747 in security travel costs and fined him an additional $155,000, the largest fine it had ever issued. [ 182 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In May 2023, the Federal Election Commission issued a $53,000 fine against de Blasio's campaign for accepting improper contributions. [ 182 ] [ ] Endorsements Electoral history Personal life De Blasio and his wife, activist and poet Chirlane McCray , met while both were working for Mayor David Dinkins ' administration and married in 1994. [ 184 ] The couple honeymooned in Cuba in violation of a US travel ban . [ 185 ] They lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn before they moved to Gracie Mansion , [ 186 ] the traditional residence of New York City mayors. They have two children: Dante, a graduate of Brooklyn Technical High School who graduated from Yale University in 2019, [ 187 ] and Chiara, a student at Santa Clara University in California. [ 58 ] [ 184 ] [ 188 ] Chiara addressed her drug use and depression in late December 2013 in a four-minute video that de Blasio's mayoral transition team released. [ 189 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] In July 2023, de Blasio and McCray announced their separation. The couple added that they intended to start dating other people, but that they would not seek a divorce and would continue to share their Park Slope residence. [ 190 ] Since that time, de Blasio has reportedly dated multiple women. In February 2025, he announced that he was dating journalist Nomiki Konst . [ 191 ] [ ] [ ] At 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), de Blasio is the tallest mayor in New York City's history.

He is a Republican and campaigned to become President of the United States in 2008. Giuliani was mayor of New York City from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2001. Giuliani became more well known during and after the September 11, 2001 attacks [ 1 ] on the World Trade Center . In 2001, Time magazine named him "Person of the Year" and he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2002, and acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history. KBE [ ] Rudy was campaigning in 1993 with the show Seinfeld where he appeared as the NYC Mayor candidate as the "over count" cholesterol man by eating too much yogurt. This "product placement" of Mayor Giuliani is often referred to as an excellent example of electioneering and boosted his popularity accordingly. On January 12, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump named Giuliani his Cyber Security Adviser. [ 2 ] Giuliani was also an important person in the Trump–Ukraine scandal , where he was accused of being one of the people who asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden.

Scott Stringer Launches Campaign for New York City Mayor  Promising to tackle corruption in city government, restore the promise of New York, and deliver results. Vision. Experience. Competence. NEW YORK, NEW YORK – Today, Scott Stringer, a proven reformer, lifelong New Yorker, and Democrat, officially announced his campaign for mayor of New York City. With a focus on ending corruption, restoring trust and competence in government, and delivering results for New Yorkers, Stringer pledged to turn the page on the culture of dysfunction that has plagued City Hall during the Adams administration. “New York City is at a crossroads, but it’s not that we're without solutions—we're without leadership,” said Stringer. “Over three years of disarray and pay-to-play politics at City Hall have left families priced out of their homes, neighborhoods feeling unsafe, and schools failing our children. New Yorkers are frustrated, and the very foundation of our city—its great promise of opportunity and fairness—has been eroded at the hands of corruption.” “But I’m confident it will take just one election to turn this around,” continued Stringer. “I’m running to deliver the vision, competent leadership, and bold reforms our city desperately needs. From ethics reform to public safety to housing to education, we need a mayor who will put people over politics and get things done for New Yorkers. I've spent my career reforming broken institutions and delivering for New Yorkers across the city and state. That's exactly what I'll do as mayor.” As a former New York City Comptroller, Manhattan Borough President, and State Assemblymember, Stringer has spent decades reforming city institutions to ensure they serve all New Yorkers, not just cronies and the well-connected. His successful track record when taking on tough fights—including rooting out corruption, auditing city agencies, and delivering common-sense policies that improve the lives of New York families—shows that he has the ability and skillset to get results as mayor. “I've transformed every office I've held,” Stringer said. “I know where the problems are at City Hall and I know exactly how to start fixing them. This isn't the moment for more empty promises, platitudes, or on-the-job training. New York needs someone ready to restore competent government from day one.” Beyond cleaning up City Hall, Stringer hits the campaign trail with an ambitious agenda focused on New York's most pressing challenges: improving public safety and quality of life, building housing and increasing affordability, cleaning up our streets, bolstering education and support for children, and ensuring the city gets to work for its people. “As a father raising children in this city, I know firsthand the challenges families face, and I’ve watched the basic functioning of our city paralyzed by corruption and mismanagement,” Stringer added. “When schools aren't working, when public spaces feel unsafe, when housing is unaffordable, people leave. New Yorkers simply aren’t getting their end of the bargain—and that is why I cannot stay on the sidelines any longer. I'm running to make sure every family can build a future here and people can proudly call New York home.” The announcement marks Stringer's return to public service after three years out of elected office, giving him the perspective of both an insider who knows how to make government work and an outsider who, like so many other New Yorkers, is fed up with the failures of the current administration. The Reformer New York Needs As a two-time citywide elected official, Scott knows how to build winning coalitions, and he has the practical skills to help New Yorkers struggling with soaring housing costs, streets and subways feeling unsafe, and broken trust in their leaders. Under Adams, City Hall has become a revolving door for scandal and self-interest. As Adams aligns himself with Donald Trump in search of a federal pardon, New Yorkers are left questioning whether their mayor is working for them or prioritizing his personal interests. Stringer offers a stark contrast: a steady hand with over 30 years of proven reform experience. While Adams courts controversy and chaos, Stringer has built his career on rooting out corruption, restoring transparency and competence to government, and putting the needs of everyday New Yorkers first. “This is a moment for real leadership, not backroom deals and drama,” Stringer said. “New Yorkers deserve a mayor who fights for them, not for his political survival and self-interest.” Stringer’s vision for restoring the promise of this great city is built on delivering tangible results, such as affordable housing, well-maintained streets, safe neighborhoods and subways, and a government that works for all. Tackling Corruption and Cleaning Up City Hall The corruption at City Hall isn’t merely a crisis; it’s a betrayal of the people and values that built this city. Federal investigations have investigated illegal foreign donations, bribery schemes, and kickbacks in public contracts—all while the urgent needs of everyday New Yorkers are ignored. That’s why Stringer launched his campaign with a comprehensive Ethics and Anti-Corruption Agenda designed to eliminate pay-to-play practices, increase transparency, and hold city officials accountable. The plan includes banning contributions from lobbyists and contractors, closing loopholes that allow undue influence, and implementing unprecedented levels of public disclosure​. As mayor, Stringer will implement gold-standard ethics rules and be a fearless champion of good government, as he has throughout his 30-year career in public service. As Manhattan Borough President, Stringer replaced patronage with merit and gave communities a real voice—strengthening and reforming community board systems. As New York City Comptroller, he exposed fraud, audited wasteful contracts, and held bad actors accountable. As a New York State Assemblymember, Stringer ended the corrupt practice of empty-seat voting and rooted out the culture of backroom politics in Albany. “When City Hall’s decisions are chaotic and corrupt, families lose their homes, schools remain overcrowded, and subways continue to crumble,” Stringer said. “This isn’t just mismanagement, it’s a collapse of public trust. Every decision and appointment my administration makes will be focused on what’s best for New Yorkers—nothing more, nothing less. That’s the standard, and it’s what I have represented in every public office I have held.” The Ethics Agenda also introduces new measures to strengthen oversight and ensure long-term accountability in city governance. Stringer’s proposals include creating an independent compliance unit to monitor and enforce campaign finance rules, mandating financial disclosures from all candidates for city office, and instituting a permanent ban on contractors who violate campaign finance laws. “Every backroom deal robs our communities of affordable housing and constricts resources from fixing the subways, improving public safety, or upgrading schools,” Stringer said. “The dysfunction and corruption stops with me. It’s time to clean up the mess and put New Yorkers—not the powerful few—back to the center of city government.” Restoring the Promise of New York Stringer’s platform reflects his vision to restore the broken compact between New Yorkers and their government—a compact that ensures affordable housing, safety, high-quality education, and functioning public services like transit. “For generations, New York City was a place where families came to build better lives—a city of opportunity, driven by a compact between the city and its people: work hard, and the city will have your back. But today, that promise is either broken or slipping away through neglect and mismanagement. It's time to restore our compact,” Stringer said. Stringer’s housing plan is the culmination of a lifetime of advocating for affordable housing, notably serving as an organizer to protect and advocate for the rights of Mitchell-Lama residents, an affordable homeownership model that Stringer hopes to emulate when he is mayor. “It is the duty of every mayor to build housing and be bold in the growth of our city, and that’s just not what the current administration has been focused on,” Stringer continued. “New Yorkers deserve leadership that not only prioritizes affordability and access to housing but ensures that our city services, including safe and clean streets and world-class education, are the keystone for thriving communities. This isn’t just about good governance, it’s about the city holding up its end of the bargain for New Yorkers who sacrifice so much just to live here and go above and beyond to make our communities so strong.” Stringer also outlined key priorities for his administration, the full details of which are available here. Highlights include: Housing Affordability: Stringer envisions his plan as Mitchell-Lama 2.0—a bold yet practical strategy that builds on the historic success of the original program to tackle New York City’s housing crisis. With four transformative pillars, this plan reimagines affordable housing to deliver stability, opportunity, and dignity for all New Yorkers. Unlocking Public Land: Transforming underutilized city-owned properties, like DOT garages and vacant lots into affordable housing through fast-tracked audits and development. Robin Hood Housing Plan: Reclaiming neglected properties from irresponsible landlords and converting them into affordable housing. Revolving Loan Fund: Establishing a new $500 million fund to support MWBE and nonprofit developers in creating community-focused housing. Revitalizing Public Housing: Securing $40 billion for critical NYCHA repairs and modernization, ensuring safe, livable homes for over 400,000 residents. “When the options for housing are a $2 million condo or a shelter, something is fundamentally broken,” Stringer said about his housing priorities. “I’ll never forget the single mom in Washington Heights who told me she was terrified of losing her home after her landlord raised the rent overnight. Fighting for families like hers is why I started this journey and why I’m running today.” Public Safety and Quality of Life: Stringer knows that everything else is secondary until we get public safety and quality of life right. He’s committed to ensuring no New York is worried when getting on the subway, sitting in the park, or walking down the street: Rebuilding and Refocusing Police Capacity: Bold recruitment efforts and innovative retention policies to address NYPD staffing shortages, including hiring 3,000 more officers, and “civilianizing” NYPD administrative roles to free up uniformed officers for core policing duties. Leveraging Technology for Smarter Policing: Integrating advanced analytics, expanded monitoring, and transparent oversight to enable the NYPD to move from reactive policing to a proactive, multi-agency approach. A Unified Approach to Public Safety and Quality of Life: Launching QualitySTAT, a performance management tool designed to align resources, streamline decision-making, and strengthen accountability across all key agencies; under a new Deputy Mayor for Quality of Life, this integrated system will address crime, quality-of-life issues, and systemic inefficiencies, creating a safer, more cohesive city. Transit Safety: A dedicated officer on every subway train, ethical data-driven monitoring, and compassionate crisis response by mental-health and other social services professionals. “New Yorkers should be able to send their kids to school, hang out in the park, and walk down the street without ever feeling unsafe," said Stringer about the pressing need for public safety solutions. “New Yorkers deserve both safe streets and accountable policing. This isn't an either/or choice. Public safety isn’t about winning the headlines or using excuses to cover up mistakes. It’s about management and delivering results that people can see and feel in their neighborhoods every day.” Supporting Families Through Affordable Childcare and Education: Stringer is determined to make childcare affordable for and responsive to the needs of all families, ensuring New York City a place where every parent and child has the support they need to thrive. Stringer’s plan includes three transformative solutions: Affordable Childcare for All Families: The Tri-Share Childcare Fund will split childcare costs between the city, employers, and families to ensure no parent is priced out of care. Extended School Hours: Extending school hours to 4:30 PM to provide free or low-cost afterschool programs, better aligning with parents’ work schedules and offering enrichment opportunities for children. Reducing Costs for Families: Scott's plan will reduce childcare costs significantly—by more than 50 percent for many families—expand access to licensed care in underserved neighborhoods, and align school schedules with the realities of today’s families. “I spoke with a mother in Queens who works two jobs just to keep her family afloat. She told me her biggest challenge isn’t the hours she works—it’s finding affordable childcare for her son. She’s not alone,” said Stringer . “Thousands of parents across our city are forced to make impossible choices every day. That’s why I’m running for mayor—to make sure no parent has to choose between their job and their child’s future.” Sanitation: Scott Stringer will start picking up the trash. His comprehensive sanitation plan will transform New York City’s waste management system into a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable operation. His plan will: Reduce Sidewalk Clutter: Prioritize shared on-street containers and innovative waste storage solutions tailored to each neighborhood. Boost Recycling and Composting: Fully integrate recycling and composting into the waste system with clear, color-coded bins and public education campaigns. Improve Efficiency: Modernize waste collection with advanced technologies, upgraded recycling facilities, and local processing plants to reduce landfill dependency. Build for the Future: Mandate waste management infrastructure in new developments, including recycling chutes and compactors, to support long-term sustainability. Scott’s plan prioritizes clean streets, public health, and environmental responsibility, delivering real results for every New Yorker. A Proven Record of Accountability and Results Stringer has spent over 30 years building a record of reform, accountability, and results for New Yorkers. In every role he’s held, Stringer has reformed government to work better for the people it serves. As New York City Comptroller, he exposed billions of dollars in waste and mismanagement across city agencies. Stringer’s reform-minded approach to uncovering corruption ensured that public funds were directed where they were needed most, from repairing NYCHA developments to improving public transit. One of Stringer’s key priorities as Comptroller was ensuring that public funds were spent wisely and transparently. By reforming how city contracts were awarded, he exposed delays, malfeasance, and waste in procurement processes that left critical services in limbo. His leadership saved taxpayers billions while demanding greater efficiency and transparency from city agencies. As Manhattan Borough President, Stringer redefined what the office could achieve. He transformed community boards into engines of local democracy, empowering neighborhoods to have a real voice in shaping their future. Scott championed affordable housing by advocating for the Mitchell-Lama program and securing funding for developments that working families could afford. His forward-thinking urban policy initiatives, from food justice to zoning reform, earned him recognition as a leader who could turn bold ideas into results. Stringer’s career as an elected official began in the New York State Assembly, where he stood up to entrenched interests and ended the corrupt practice of empty-seat voting. He championed tenants’ rights, fought for hardworking families, and laid the foundation for his career-long commitment to making government work for everyday people. At every stage of his career, Stringer has delivered results that matter. From exposing fraud, saving taxpayer dollars, to creating opportunities for New York’s families, Stringer’s record speaks for itself. His proven ability to reform broken systems and deliver for New Yorkers is exactly what the city needs now to rebuild trust, restore competence, and move forward. About Scott Stringer Scott Stringer is a lifelong New Yorker born and raised in Washington Heights. Scott's three decades of public service are defined by his love for New York City and Scott has a proven track record as a reformer who knows how to make government work for people. As a State Assemblymember, he fearlessly took on the political establishment, ended the corrupt practice of empty-seat voting, and championed the rights of tenants and hardworking New York families. As Manhattan Borough President, Scott revolutionized what the office could achieve. He didn't just write reports; he wrote a playbook for urban policy, issuing over 40 groundbreaking studies that tackled everything from affordable housing to food justice. When others saw community boards as relics, Scott saw them as engines of democracy, reforming and empowering them to give neighborhoods a real say in their future. Then, as New York City Comptroller, Scott emerged as New York's fiercest watchdog. He fearlessly exposed waste and corruption while protecting billions in taxpayer dollars. His innovative Boardroom Accountability Project became a national model for corporate reform, proving that good government and fiscal responsibility go hand in hand. But for Scott, this isn't just politics; it's personal. He and his wife Elyse are raising their two sons, Max and Miles, in the city they love. Like countless New Yorkers, he feels the weight of a city that’s not meeting the needs of its people: rising costs, failing services, and a city government that too often forgets who it's supposed to serve. Every subway ride to school and every walk through their neighborhood reinforces the urgency to fix what’s broken. That's why Scott has returned to the political arena with a bold vision to restore competent leadership to City Hall. Drawing on his unparalleled experience and unwavering values, he's ready to rebuild the compact between New York and its people: work hard, and the city will have your back. In Scott's 30 years of public service, he's never lost faith in the promise of New York. Now, at this crucial moment, he's offering not just his experience but his heart—the heart of a true New Yorker who knows that our city's greatest chapters are still to be written.

Meet Scott Scott Stringer has spent three decades fighting for New Yorkers. Born and raised in New York, Scott
                    is a proven reformer who has always put people over politics and stood up for this city. Scott has a
                    consistent track record of winning for New Yorkers: protecting Mitchell-Lama residents as a
                    community organizer, ending corrupt practices in the State Assembly, championing affordable housing
                    and accountable government as Manhattan Borough President, and exposing waste and saving taxpayers
                    billions as Comptroller. “I've transformed every office I've held. I know where the problems are at City
                    Hall, and I know exactly how to start fixing them. This isn't the moment for more empty promises,
                    platitudes,
                    or on-the-job training. New York needs someone ready to restore competent government from day one.” Now, as New York faces unprecedented challenges, Scott is ready to clean up City Hall and restore
                    competent leadership from the moment he takes office. But for Scott, this isn't just politics, it's personal. He and his wife Elyse are raising their
                    sons,
                    Max and Miles, in the city they love. Like countless New Yorkers, he feels the weight of a city
                    that’s
                    not meeting the needs of its people. Every subway ride to school and every walk through their
                    neighborhood reinforces the urgency to fix what’s broken. “As a father raising children in this city, I know firsthand the challenges
                    families
                    face, and I’ve watched the basic functioning of our city paralyzed by corruption and mismanagement.
                    When
                    schools aren't working, when public spaces feel unsafe, when housing is unaffordable, people leave.
                    New
                    Yorkers simply aren’t getting their end of the bargain.” New York doesn't need another showman, it needs a mayor who will do—and wants to do—the work our
                    city
                    needs. Someone who knows the city like the back of his hand and is focused on our most pressing
                    issues,
                    from cleaning up the trash on the streets, to restoring safety, to making sure government delivers
                    for
                    the people it’s meant to serve. That’s what Scott is all about. “This is a moment for real leadership, not backroom deals and drama. New Yorkers
                    deserve
                    a mayor who fights for them, not for his political survival and self-interest.”  Scott's Track Record New York City Comptroller (2014–2021) Fiscal Accountability: Grew the city’s pension funds from $147 billion to $240 billion,
                                    achieving a cumulative 9.12% return—exceeding the portfolio benchmark and required
                                    actuarial rate of return (7%). Overhauled the back office of the City’s pension fund system—the
                                    fourth-largest institutional investor in the nation—and instituted new ethics, risk
                                    management, and compliance practices, banned “placement agents,” and aligned fees
                                    paid to investment advisors with their performance. Conducted rigorous audits of city agencies, including NYCHA,

                                    hundreds of millions while ensuring better service delivery. Housing Advocacy: Conducted 17 audits of NYCHA, identifying inefficiencies in lead
                                    paint remediation, boiler repairs, and tenant services, leading to tangible
                                    improvements. Focused on NYC’s affordable housing crisis by identifying over 1,000
                                    vacant, city-owned lots that could be used to boost the City’s affordable housing
                                    stock by more than 50,000 units. Diversity and Transparency: Established the city’s first-ever Chief Diversity Officer,
                                    increasing the Comptroller’s office spending with minority- and women-owned

                                    access to procurement programs, exposing lack of equal access for minority firms and
                                    grading city departments' outreach efforts. Created transparency tools like ClaimStat and Checkbook NYC,
                                    shedding light on the city’s legal claims and contracts. Childcare and Education: Developed the NYC Under 3 initiative, the largest local investment
                                    in childcare proposed in the nation, making affordable childcare accessible to
                                    thousands of families. Published a report advocating for teacher residency programs to
                                    improve teacher retention and student outcomes. Small Business Support: Launched the "Save Main Street" initiative during the COVID-19
                                    pandemic, providing grants and resources to struggling small businesses. Conducted comprehensive engagement with small businesses, creating a
                                    blueprint for ensuring their survival and growth. Streamlined bureaucratic processes, such as permit applications, to
                                    make New York City more business-friendly. Public Safety and Justice: Created the award-winning ClaimStat initiative to track lawsuits
                                    against the city, identifying issues early and cutting claims by tens of millions of
                                    dollars. Added the NYPD to the city’s Checkbook database, providing real-time
                                    transparency of NYPD spending and contracts. Terminated the MOU that allowed the NYPD to shield surveillance and
                                    equipment purchases, increasing transparency around department spending. Climate Leadership: Led the largest divestment from fossil fuels by a public pension
                                    fund, a $4 billion move, and doubled investments in renewable energy to $6 billion. Championed a Green New Deal for New York City, including plans to
                                    phase out fossil fuels, expand renewable energy projects, and create green jobs. Audits and Investigations to Reform Government: Conducted high-impact audits exposing waste and corruption, saving
                                    billions in taxpayer dollars. Led audits of NYCHA, uncovering systemic failures, mismanagement of
                                    $692 million in federal funds, and poor inventory practices, prompting critical
                                    reforms. Identified 1,100 vacant city-owned properties that could create
                                    57,000 affordable housing units. Exposed health and safety hazards in city shelters, leading to major
                                    corrective actions by DHS. Uncovered $31 million in underreported US Open revenue, securing
                                    additional rent payments and lease renegotiations. Highlighted NYC’s early COVID response failures, driving
                                    improvements in crisis management. Manhattan Borough President (2006–2013) Education Initiatives: Launched "School Overcrowding War Rooms," forcing the Department of
                                    Education to invest in new schools and reallocate resources to address overcrowding. Advocated for better public school funding and policies like
                                    universal pre-K to close the achievement gap across Manhattan’s public schools. Partnered with communities to secure $24 million in arts education
                                    funding, ensuring every child has access to creative resources. Facilitated the expansion of major universities, including Columbia,
                                    Fordham, NYU, and Cornell Tech, creating thousands of jobs while balancing community
                                    needs through innovative solutions like the West Harlem Special District. Affordable Housing: Opposed predatory real estate practices and supported community land
                                    trusts to protect tenants from displacement. Established the first-ever Urban Fellows Program, which placed an
                                    urban fellow to work in every community board to help ensure a stronger community

                                    equitable urban planning. Championed responsible rezoning initiatives that included
                                    affordability guarantees and protections for longtime residents. Estimated that New York City renters sunk approximately $507 million
                                    into security deposits alone, leading directly to landmark state legislation that
                                    now limits security deposits to one month’s rent and empowers tenants. Sustainability and Public Space: Led efforts to expand bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, and green
                                    spaces, promoting sustainable urban living. Advocated for energy efficiency and green building standards in

                                    across the borough. Community-Based Planning: Strengthened and reformed community board systems, ensuring greater
                                    public input in land use and zoning decisions. Created the West Harlem Special District, a rezoning of the West
                                    Harlem neighborhood that helped protect its character and allowed tenants to stay in
                                    their homes while also ensuring that Columbia University could expand. New York State Assembly (1993–2005) Ethics and Transparency: An outspoken advocate for democratizing the legislature. Led efforts to pass the first ethics reforms in Albany in a
                                    generation—including the end of “empty seat voting,” the practice that for decades
                                    allowed lawmakers to vote on legislation without even being present in the Capitol. Advocated for increased government accountability and campaign
                                    finance reform to reduce corruption. Tenants' Rights: Bucked party leadership with bold votes against rent regulation
                                    roll-backs, including opposing vacancy decontrol, a pivotal moment in the fight to
                                    preserve affordable housing, ensuring rent-stabilized units remained available to
                                    low- and middle-income families. Went against his party to stop the repeal of the commuter tax to put
                                    New York City’s interests first. Supported legislation under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act to
                                    expand tenant protections and prevent evictions during housing crises. Landmark Legislation: Co-sponsored the state’s first marriage equality legislation and
                                    passed bills protecting survivors of domestic violence, including stronger
                                    restraining order enforcement and safe housing guarantees. Opposed the repeal of the commuter tax, defending NYC’s fiscal
