Louis Flores 2025 Candidate to represent District 3 in the New York City Council Home Home About About Political Philosophy Political Philosophy Platform Platform Contribute Contribute Media Media Contact Contact Twitter Linkedin Political Philosophy The Duopoly of the Democratic and Republican Parties can no longer serve, much less safeguard, democracy. Instead, powerholders in the political parties seek self-enrichment through corruption. An aggressive movement is required to check this corruption. As a result, both Democrats and Republicans breach the social compact that underpins our form of Government, creating poverty that is openly ignored. Although both the Democratic and Republican Parties comprise the Duopoly, in New York, the Governments are controlled by supermajories of Democrats. What we experience in New York is that Democrats exploit the language of progressivism and social reform in order to safely give-up strategic public assets to real estate developers, Wall Street, and other private sector interests. Witness what we've seen in respect of charity hospitals, public schools, public housing, and so on. Job opportunities barely pay enough for people to afford basic needs. Inflation, the rent burden, and exploitation of our labour stop the middle class from growing. When peoples' basic needs of housing, nutrition, and healthcare are met, there's no reason for people to resort to crime to support themselves. If job opportunities can't support peoples' basic needs, then the hand of the Government must intervene in the markets to promote the general welfare. That's what Government programmes, like WIC, SNAP, and Medicaid are for : To give people an equal opportunity to participate in society and to access and exercise their civil liberties and civil rights. Once people feel safe, they can focus on their family, friends, and community. As people follow their dreams, they create the life that gives them meaning and purpose. A healthy society allows everyone to thrive. However, Democrats join with Republicans to leave scores of us in poverty. That's unjust. We can no longer accept this. Creating opportunities leads to a healthy society. The Duopoly have distorted the Government's priorities. The time-honoured way of meeting peoples' basic needs is the simple path that creates opportunities for our lives. As we work together to help more New Yorkers move up into the middle class, we must never forget that the foundation of our society is not giving up on our irreplaceable strategic public assets. The lazy politics of surrender and defeat costed us over a dozen full-service charity hospitals in New York City. They bled public schools to pump-up charter schools. Now, they're deteriorating public housing. Democrats are embracing the same lazy politics of surrender and defeat right now as they prepare to bow before REBNY to give-up public housing in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan to a billionaire developer, who supports Donald Trump. We can't allow it ! We must refuse to compromise with each of the Duopoly, REBNY, and Wall Street. We must resist. In exchange for your support, I shall endeavour to create a new political party that will never surrender to the lazy politics of defeat. It's time to make a clean break with the Duopoly. It's in your best interests. (Image credit : CC BY-SA 4.0 by Androidmarsexpress. This image is presented without alteration.)

Louis Flores 2025 Candidate to represent District 3 in the New York City Council Home Home About About Political Philosophy Political Philosophy Platform Platform Contribute Contribute Media Media Contact Contact Twitter Linkedin Platform A bottom-up paradigm for a new social compact. When people live in poverty, they cannot access their Constitutional and civil rights, much less their civil liberties. The Declaration of Independence, which eventually led to the foundation of the U.S. Government, admitted that all Americans are born with the natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Government can't take back that promise. Since there is a substantive public interest in a representative democracy for the Government to promote citizens' participation in their own governance, the Government began to engage in helping its citizens to access their rights and liberties. After centuries of slavery and other systemic forms of discrimination and oppression, and prompted by revolutionary social movements, the Government finally began passing laws, enacting programmes, and promulgating policies to help Americans access their Constitutional rights, civil rights, and civil liberties. This campaign is premised on holding the Government accountable to fulfilling its promise to help their citizens to thrive : By creating more opportunities for equality. Abraham Maslow was a renowned New York psychologist and college professor. He developed a hierarchy of needs , which informs the values that guides the Louis Flores 2025 campaign. The political platform of this campaign is organised into categories that follow Dr. Maslow's teachings. Basic Needs Housing. The New York City Council can no longer ignore the Government's responsibility to ensure that every New York has ready access to affordable housing. The Government must also stop turning its back to civil rights violations taking place daily in and out of the City's housing court system. Because of the homelessness crisis, the Government must improve the living conditions in all homeless shelters and make it easier for the homeless to move out of the shelter system. The time has come for the Government to admit that gentrification is not a housing plan, but a displacement plan. We can and must do better. The Louis Flores 2025 campaign emerged out of the fight to save public housing from demolition and privatisation, and this campaign's platform will roll-up to ensure that all New Yorkers are housed and live free of landlord harassment in their living spaces. Once more, the Government must embrace its unique role to provide low-cost housing to people living on low- or fixed-incomes. Food. The New York City Council can no longer ignore how the Eric Adams administration deliberately makes it difficult for people living in poverty to apply for SNAP . Government policy must also support cornerstone community institutions, which distribute and provide nutrition to New Yorkers. Finally, the Government must ensure that the nutritional assistance that is reaching New Yorkers is non-GMO or organic, especially for children and senior citizens. Safety. The New York City Council must take the lead to ensure that citizens don't live in fear of police brutality, political oppression, and officer-committed homicide. Strategic, public assets. The New York City Council should take the lead in safeguarding strategic, public assets, like public housing and public charity hospitals, instead of selling them out to private-sector real estate developers. Without shelter, nutrition, and safety, people's lives become destabalised, preventing them from focusing on accessing their rights under the Government. Psychological Needs Healthcare. The New York City Council must take the lead in making sure that New Yorkers can access truly affordable health care. For example, New Yorkers should not be worse-off financially when they get off Medicaid after they get a private-sector job and move to private health insurance. Since the Coronavirus pandemic (" COVID-19 ") is not over, and other pandemics are on the horizon, like the Highly-pathogenic avian influenza (" HPAI "), the New York City Council must step up oversight of and improve transparency around weekly variant surveillance reports. Publishing and implementing the Government responsiveness and readiness plans for responding to these pandemics is critical for keeping New Yorkers safe and healthy. Family planning. The New York City Council must take a lead to provide New Yorkers with the privacy to make all basic decisions about their relationships, including planning for their families. No Government body subject to New York City Council oversight should be allowed to infringe on these natural rights . Civil rights. The New York City Council must take the lead on ensuring that all New Yorkers experience equal civil rights. For example, the mandate and jurisdiction of the Council's Committee on Civil and Human Rights must be enlarged to include oversight of the City's housing courts, the political oppression used by the New York Police Department , and the use of tax revenue taken from New Yorkers by the Federal Government to pay for wars in Europe and the Middle East, the latter which involves funding the génocide of Palestinians . All forms of racism, discrimination, and opporession are not being addressed, and Municipal civil rights oversight bodies, which have failed, must either be rehabilitated or replaced. Self-Fulfillment Needs Education. The New York Council must take the lead to end racial segregration in public schools and to make the City University of New York (" CUNY ") free of charge. Providing New Yorkers with the ability to seek professional, undergraduate, and post-graduate education will be empowering. The Government must also end discrimination within the CUNY system by providing on-campus housing for all of CUNY's component schools. A school like Medgar Evers College must provide its students with a rich residential life experience, and that must involve the option to live in dormitories on-campus. Job training. The New York City Council must take the lead to provide New Yorkers with job training and career change assistance, including in the arts. New York is the Nation's financial center and its largest metropolis. It is also one of two focal points in the Nation's entertainment industry. Regulate the economy. The New York City Council must take the lead to re-regulate the free market economy to end abuses of labour and to end speculation in land and capital. For example, since the Federal and State Governments have abdicated their responsibility to fairly tax the rich, the Municipal Government must take steps to institute a progressive tax regime on the corporations, billionaires, and millionaires operating or living in the five boroughs. Anti-corruption. The real estate industry and Wall Street exercise too much influence over Government. There is a way for the New York City Council to step-up anti-corruption policies. As the next Councilmember, I promise to weed out conflicts of interest in Community Boards, and the first change I will make, with the power of appointment, is to name an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the S.D.N.Y. public corrupton unit as the chair of Manhattan Community Board 4 . There must be a firm stop placed to the casual way that the appearances of each of conflicts of interest, the role of money in politics, and alleged corruption pervert Government, particularly in respect of land use review matters. Municipal investigation into sects and cults. Given the eye-opening trial that exposed the NXIVM cult , the New York City Council must take a leading role to investigate human potential development groups and cult-like sex harems operating in New York City. Helping our labour pool develop new educational, vocational, and occupational skills will improve our educated workforce and drive economic growth. When New Yorkers seek job and occupational opportunities that best interest them, and when they are richly compensated for those jobs and occupations, in return, our citizens will experience fulfilment in their lives. Furthermore, market regulation and anti-corruption measures will permit the Government to focus on helping citizens thrive, instead of being a doormat to the 1 per cent. Taking human trafficking more seriously will also end the coërced or forced bondage of women. A new social compact We live in a society that is a collection of our lived, life experiences. As Mayor David Dinkins (D-New York City) said during his inauguration speech , "I see New York as a gorgeous mosaic of race and religious faith, of national origin and sexual orientation, of individuals whose families arrived yesterday and generations ago, coming through Ellis Island or Kennedy Airport or on buses bound for the Port Authority." We must honour our families, friends, and neighbours . When the Government ensures that we all have opportunities to reach a level of fulfilment in our lives, that is when the Government can deliver on its promise that humans can access their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

After meeting direct action activists, he became involved at the tail end of the fight for marriage equality in New York through his involvement or association with the groups, Connecting Rainbows and Queer Rising. He fought against the luxury condo conversion of St. Vincent's Hospital. Later, as one of a loose collective to vote then Council Speaker Christine Quinn out of office in the 2013 Democratic Party primary, Louis became an anti-corruption activist. When he foresaw Democrats participate in the sell-out of public housing, he co-founded in 2019 the group Fight For NYCHA to stop the privatisation of strategic public assets. Louis provides consulting services through Connaissable . He has also developed a Government transparency and computer-assisted reporting Web application, C'est Vrai .

MENLO PARK Calif., June 9—Dr. Abraham Maslow, pro fessor of psychology at Bran deis University in Waltham, Mass., and founder of what has come to he known as human istic psychology, died here yesterday of a heart attack. He was 62 years old. Dr. Maslow had completed one year of a four‐year writing and research grant awarded by the Laughlin Foundation here. He wrote half a dozen books on psychology. Among them were “Motivation and Person ality” (1956), and “Toward a Psychology of Science” (1966). His humantistic psychology, which has been called the third school of psychology, along with Freudian psychology and behaviorism, was first outlined in articles Dr. Maslow wrote in 1943. A former colleague said that some recent manifestations of Dr. Maslow's school are Syna non, the drug addiction re habilitation center, and the Esalen Institute, one of the best‐known centers practicing the group encounter form of psychotherapy. Dr. Maslow was a former president of the American Psychological Association. He had been an editor and a con tributor to psychology journals. He developed many concepts widely used both by psychol ogists and in industry, among them the theory of the hier archy of needs. Dr. Maslow was born in Brooklyn in 1908. He took all his degrees at the University of Wisconsin: B.A. in 1930, M.A. in 1931, and Ph.D. in 1934. He held an honorary degree from Xavier University in Cincinnati. He taught at Brooklyn Col lege and at Teachers College of Columbia University before joining the Brandeis staff in 1951. At. Brandeis he was Philip Meyers, Professor of Psy chology and, from 1951 to 1961, chairman of the psychology de partment. On his grant here he was investigating the nature of evil in man.

Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography Office Food at a nutrition-related announcement by the mayor’s office in February. New York City’s timely processing of cash and food assistance applications plunged to new lows last fiscal year, continuing a spiral Mayor Eric Adams’ administration has attributed to an ongoing pandemic spike in demand, as well as agency staffing shortages. The Human Resource Administration (HRA) promptly worked through just 28.8 percent of cash assistance applications during the year that ended in June, down from 82.3 percent the year prior and north of 90 percent before that. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly referred to as food stamps, saw a slightly less dismal application processing rate of 39.7 percent, down from 60.1 percent the year prior and well below the city’s 90.6 percent target. Katie Kelleher, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society, bemoaned the collapse of a system that once worked efficiently. “New York City knew how to manage this—knew how to deliver benefits [on time],” she told City Limits. While the COVID-19 pandemic put real strain on the system, the city has had years to adjust to a new reality where more people need to access the social safety net, she added: “This is the new caseload. It’s not going away.” There were about 1.74 million New Yorkers receiving SNAP as of July, up from about 1.5 million in July 2019. The volume of cash assistance recipients was nearly 490,000 in July, according to DSS, up from about 332,900 in 2019. Under federal and state law, all SNAP and cash assistance applications and recertifications must be processed by HRA, part of the Department of Social Services (DSS), within 30 days. Anything pending beyond that threshold is considered delayed. “I have very few clients whose processing is done in the required time frame,” said Deborah Berkman, a supervising attorney with the Public Benefits Unit at New York Legal Assistance Group. “Many of my clients need to interview as part of their application and they cannot because a several-hour wait time is the norm.” This is a major concern for families with children who are facing eviction in housing court, Berkman added, as they must activate cash assistance in order to receive help covering their rent. “Slow processing times lead to evictions,” she said. The latest data, part of the annual Mayor’s Management Report released Friday, comes as the city races to comply with a federal court order to eliminate its backlogs for both SNAP and cash assistance by March 2024. The injunction is part of a class action lawsuit filed in January by the Legal Aid Society and New York Legal Assistance Group, alleging that city officials were leaving New Yorkers without benefits to which they were entitled. While the MMR data pertains to first-time benefit applications only, the lawsuit is aiming to eliminate recertification delays as well, for people seeking to renew their assistance. According to the city, pandemic-related recertification deadline waivers have expired, putting more pressure on the system as a whole. A recertification delay can lead to a lapse in benefits—a dangerous situation for recipients like Diana Ramos, a leader with the Safety Net Project at the Urban Justice Center. Ramos has Type 2 diabetes and has yet to receive her SNAP for September. “I’m not eating properly, and I’m deathly afraid of my sugar bottoming out, and ending up in the hospital,” she told City Limits. Ramos likes to make protein-rich smoothies. But without SNAP, she has turned to powdered lemonade to keep her blood sugar up. Recently, Ramos says she waited on hold with the city for six hours trying to sort out her benefits. “I can’t blame the HRA workers,” she said. “The anger needs to be sent to the people in charge—they need to do better.” Court filings suggest that HRA has recently improved its processing for people who receive SNAP but not cash assistance —a category known as “SNAP-only.” The agency says it has cut its SNAP-only application and recertification delays considerably—with a backlog of fewer than 800 as of the end of July—though Kelleher of Legal Aid said her team is in talks with the city about its methodology. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of low-income New Yorkers who receive cash assistance continue to watch the deadline for timely processing come and go. Most of them also receive SNAP, but see their benefits processed on a separate, less-streamlined track from their “SNAP-only” counterparts. The city has set a gradual timeline for improvement for these cases, according to an August court filing—27,800 overdue by the end of September, up to 29,700 by the end of November, and down to 4,200 by the end of February. HRA is on track so far to meet those benchmarks, Kelleher said. According to the MMR, the timeliness threshold for some cash assistance applications decreased last fall from 45 days to 30 days, making a year-over-year comparison impossible. But Kelleher said the city knew this adjustment was coming and should have been prepared. “The deadline is set by law,” she said. “They’re required to comply with it. It wasn’t a surprise.” The MMR also attributes poor processing rates to an “unprecedented and continuing increase in applications” and “fewer staff due to attrition and retirements.” In a further statement to City Limits, HRA said it saw more cash assistance applications in the last fiscal year than in any other at least since 2008, and noted the larger volume of benefit recipients this year compared to prior to the pandemic. “Despite unprecedented challenges following the lifting of key pandemic-related supports and the highest volume of cash assistance applications since 2008, in [fiscal year 2023], on average NYC DSS-HRA helped more New Yorkers receive these critical benefits than in recent pre-pandemic years,” an agency spokesperson said.* According to the MMR, HRA is also “taking aggressive action to fill critical vacancies, invest in technology and implement process improvements to improve timeliness.” Between March and May, HRA reported hiring 127 people to assist with the SNAP-only program and 299 for its cash assistance track. And in June, the agency reported onboarding another 201 and 130 employees respectively, court documents show. But staffing is still below pre-pandemic levels. As of July 6, just after the turn of the fiscal year, HRA had 10,853 full-time employees, compared to 12,528 in Dec. 2019. And earlier this month, Mayor Adams called for 5 percent spending cuts across agencies in the city’s financial plan, citing the cost of sheltering an influx of asylum seekers. Berkman of New York Legal Assistance Group said austerity budgeting by the Adams Administration is to blame for her clients being left without food and cash assistance. “When you don’t adequately fund the agencies they cannot keep up with the federal mandates,” Berkman said. “That’s it.” To reach the reporter behind this story, contact [email protected] .

It was originally introduced by Kurt Goldstein, a physician specializing in neuroanatomy and psychiatry in the early half of the 20th century. As conceived by Goldstein, self-actualization is the ultimate goal of all organisms. He saw all behaviors and drives as manifestations of this overarching motivation. It was American psychologist Abraham H. Maslow , however, who popularized self-actualization. He defined it more narrowly and diverged from Goldstein in his conception of when and how self-actualization can emerge as a motivator. Similar to Goldstein, Maslow saw self-actualization as the fulfillment of one’s greatest potential. In his discussions of self-actualization, however, he was referring solely to people, rather than all organisms. In addition, his theory asserts that the drive to self-actualize will only emerge as a motivator once a variety of more basic needs are met. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs Self-actualization is at the pinnacle of what Maslow defined as a hierarchy of human needs. In this hierarchy, lower needs (described as "pre-potent" needs) typically must be met before higher needs emerge. Physiological needs are the most primary in this hierarchy. Although Maslow declined to make a list of physiological needs, citing the nearly endless contributors to physical homeostasis , "food" was his prime example. Maslow suggested that if an individual is starving or near starving, he or she is essentially defined by that hunger. In most cases, an individual with extreme hunger will eschew higher needs, such as love and belonging, to fulfill the body’s need for nourishment . Once physiological needs are met, the next level of need—safety—immediately rises to consciousness and begins to drive behavior. Thus, the need for food may be forgotten or suddenly seem trivial compared with the need for physical protection, provided the individual continues to have a steady food supply. This cycle of need, fulfillment, and forgetting occurs at every stage of the hierarchy. More From Britannica motivation: Self-actualization Maslow asserted that average adults in affluent , organized societies have few safety needs under typical conditions. Most have little need to worry about physical attacks or fires, for example. Thus, safety needs in these individuals are expressed in subtle ways, such as the desire for savings accounts and steady jobs. However, Maslow noted that safety needs drive individuals in less stable conditions, such as those living in low socioeconomic conditions or under wartime conditions. He also suggested that certain mental health conditions reflect, in part, safety needs. He argued that individuals with neurotic or compulsive tendencies are psychologically similar to children in their sense of danger. However, although children truly are dependent on others for safety, the neurotic individual only feels as if this is the case. Likewise, just as children seek to avoid unpredictable events because of the danger they might present, people with compulsive behaviors try to make the world orderly and predictable to avoid perceived danger. Love needs are next in Maslow’s hierarchy. These include friendship, family , and sexual love, as well as the desire to be accepted by peer groups and to receive affection. To meet love needs, individuals must be positioned to both give and receive love. Maslow, like many theorists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, suggested that the failure to fulfill love needs is at the root of much of modern psychopathology. Near the top of Maslow’s hierarchy are esteem needs. These needs include the desire for competence, high self-regard, respect, a sense of strength, and general self-worth. Maslow noted that if these needs are not met, an individual either becomes deeply discouraged or develops maladjusted methods for coping with feelings of inferiority and worthlessness. Only after these needs—physiological, safety, love, and esteem—are met can an individual begin to be motivated by the need for self-actualization. Maslow’s concept of self-actualization Maslow argued that, to be truly happy, painters need to paint, writers need to write, musicians need to play. This is self-actualization. However, he also noted that even if all other needs are met, self-actualization does not emerge as a motivator in all cases. When it does, it can take many forms, depending on individual talents and values , for example. Often the urge is creative, as in the case of artists or writers; however, it might also take the form of maximizing the quality of one’s relationships or perfecting the physical form through athletics and good health. Maslow noted that self-actualization is one of the least studied and understood needs, because of its relative rarity. It is the exception rather than the rule, he stated, for an individual’s other needs to be so sufficiently met that self-actualization can emerge as a motivator. Are you a student?

Subscribe However, there are numerous examples of individuals living in states of poverty, loneliness , and low self-esteem who nonetheless seem to self-actualize through their work. Examples include Vincent van Gogh , whose life and suicide suggest a deep well of unmet needs, and Anne Frank , whose universally acclaimed diary was written in, and facilitated by, conditions of extreme danger. Maslow’s theory is not insensible to these obvious exceptions. He noted that in certain people the creative urge is so strong that it outweighs other needs, including those considered to be pre-potent in most individuals. He did not go so far as to say that in some cases self-actualization occurs because of hardship but admitted that it may occur despite unmet needs. Questions remain, then, about individuals who seem to self-actualize in direct response to need-threatening conditions.

What are some criticisms and limitations of the social contract theory in today's society? Show more Show less social contract ,  in political philosophy , an actual or hypothetical compact, or agreement, between the ruled or between the ruled and their rulers, defining the rights and duties of each. In primeval times, according to the theory, individuals were born into an anarchic state of nature , which was happy or unhappy according to the particular version of the theory. They then, by exercising natural reason , formed a society (and a government ) by means of a social contract. Although similar ideas can be traced to the Greek Sophists , social-contract theories had their greatest currency in the 17th and 18th centuries and are associated with the English philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke and the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau . What distinguished these theories of political obligation from other doctrines of the period was their attempt to justify and delimit political authority on the grounds of individual self-interest and rational consent . By comparing the advantages of organized government with the disadvantages of the state of nature, they showed why and under what conditions government is useful and ought therefore to be accepted by all reasonable people as a voluntary obligation. These conclusions were then reduced to the form of a social contract, from which it was supposed that all the essential rights and duties of citizens could be logically deduced. Theories of the social contract differed according to their purpose: some were designed to justify the power of the sovereign , while others were intended to safeguard the individual from oppression by a sovereign who was all too powerful. The social contract in Hobbes According to Hobbes ( Leviathan , 1651), the state of nature was one in which there were no enforceable criteria of right and wrong. People took for themselves all that they could, and human life was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” The state of nature was therefore a state of war , which could be ended only if individuals agreed (in a social contract) to give their liberty into the hands of a sovereign, on the sole condition that their lives were safeguarded by sovereign power. For Hobbes the authority of the sovereign is absolute, in the sense that no authority is above the sovereign, whose will is law . That, however, does not mean that the power of the sovereign is all-encompassing: subjects remain free to act as they please in cases in which the sovereign is silent (in other words, when the law does not address the action concerned). The social contract allows individuals to leave the state of nature and enter civil society , but the former remains a threat and returns as soon as governmental power collapses. Because the power of Leviathan (the political state ) is uncontested, however, its collapse is very unlikely and occurs only when it is no longer able to protect its subjects. The social contract in Locke John Locke The philosopher John Locke, oil on canvas by Herman Verelst, 1689; in the National Portrait Gallery, London. (more) Locke (in the second of the Two Treatises of Government , 1690) differed from Hobbes insofar as he conceived of the state of nature not as a condition of complete license but rather as a state in which humans, though free, equal, and independent, are obliged under the law of nature to respect each other’s rights to life, liberty, and property . Individuals nevertheless agree to form a commonwealth (and thereby to leave the state of nature) in order to institute an impartial power capable of arbitrating disputes and redressing injuries. Accordingly, Locke held that the obligation to obey civil government under the social contract was conditional upon the protection of the natural rights of each person, including the right to private property. Sovereigns who violated these terms could be justifiably overthrown. Locke thus stated one of the fundamental principles of political liberalism : that there can be no subjection to power without consent—though once political society has been founded, citizens are obligated to accept the decisions of a majority of their number. Such decisions are made on behalf of the majority by the legislature , though the ultimate power of choosing the legislature rests with the people; and even the powers of the legislature are not absolute, because the law of nature remains as a permanent standard and as a principle of protection against arbitrary authority.

Who were the key philosophers associated with the social contract theory? How did Thomas Hobbes define the concept of the social contract? What was John Locke's view of the social contract and natural rights? How did Jean-Jacques Rousseau's interpretation of the social contract differ from Hobbes and Locke? Why is the social contract considered important in the development of modern political systems? What role does the social contract play in the relationship between individuals and the state? How does the social contract address the issue of authority and legitimacy in governance? In what way has the social contract theory influenced contemporary political thought and systems? What are some criticisms and limitations of the social contract theory in today's society?   social contract ,  in political philosophy , an actual or hypothetical compact, or agreement, between the ruled or between the ruled and their rulers, defining the rights and duties of each. In primeval times, according to the theory, individuals were born into an anarchic state of nature , which was happy or unhappy according to the particular version of the theory. They then, by exercising natural reason , formed a society (and a government ) by means of a social contract.     Although similar ideas can be traced to the Greek Sophists , social-contract theories had their greatest currency in the 17th and 18th centuries and are associated with the English philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke and the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau . What distinguished these theories of political obligation from other doctrines of the period was their attempt to justify and delimit political authority on the grounds of individual self-interest and rational consent . By comparing the advantages of organized government with the disadvantages of the state of nature, they showed why and under what conditions government is useful and ought therefore to be accepted by all reasonable people as a voluntary obligation. These conclusions were then reduced to the form of a social contract, from which it was supposed that all the essential rights and duties of citizens could be logically deduced.   Theories of the social contract differed according to their purpose: some were designed to justify the power of the sovereign , while others were intended to safeguard the individual from oppression by a sovereign who was all too powerful.   The social contract in Hobbes  According to Hobbes ( Leviathan , 1651), the state of nature was one in which there were no enforceable criteria of right and wrong. People took for themselves all that they could, and human life was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” The state of nature was therefore a state of war , which could be ended only if individuals agreed (in a social contract) to give their liberty into the hands of a sovereign, on the sole condition that their lives were safeguarded by sovereign power.     For Hobbes the authority of the sovereign is absolute, in the sense that no authority is above the sovereign, whose will is law . That, however, does not mean that the power of the sovereign is all-encompassing: subjects remain free to act as they please in cases in which the sovereign is silent (in other words, when the law does not address the action concerned). The social contract allows individuals to leave the state of nature and enter civil society , but the former remains a threat and returns as soon as governmental power collapses. Because the power of Leviathan (the political state ) is uncontested, however, its collapse is very unlikely and occurs only when it is no longer able to protect its subjects.   The social contract in Locke  John Locke The philosopher John Locke, oil on canvas by Herman Verelst, 1689; in the National Portrait Gallery, London. (more) The philosopher John Locke, oil on canvas by Herman Verelst, 1689; in the National Portrait Gallery, London. (more) Locke (in the second of the Two Treatises of Government , 1690) differed from Hobbes insofar as he conceived of the state of nature not as a condition of complete license but rather as a state in which humans, though free, equal, and independent, are obliged under the law of nature to respect each other’s rights to life, liberty, and property . Individuals nevertheless agree to form a commonwealth (and thereby to leave the state of nature) in order to institute an impartial power capable of arbitrating disputes and redressing injuries. Accordingly, Locke held that the obligation to obey civil government under the social contract was conditional upon the protection of the natural rights of each person, including the right to private property. Sovereigns who violated these terms could be justifiably overthrown.     Locke thus stated one of the fundamental principles of political liberalism : that there can be no subjection to power without consent—though once political society has been founded, citizens are obligated to accept the decisions of a majority of their number. Such decisions are made on behalf of the majority by the legislature , though the ultimate power of choosing the legislature rests with the people; and even the powers of the legislature are not absolute, because the law of nature remains as a permanent standard and as a principle of protection against arbitrary authority.

National Security and International Narcotics The National Security and International Narcotics Unit is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of domestic and international criminal conduct that threatens U.S. national security, including counterterrorism, counterintelligence, sanctions evasion, export control, malign foreign influence, transnational repression, and international narcotics and weapons trafficking matters. The Unit works closely with the Office’s federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the New York City Police Department, as well as components across the U.S. Intelligence Community. Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force investigates and prosecutes crimes relating to the operation of the country’s securities and commodities markets and to fraud on both individual and institutional investors, including all varieties of securities fraud, insider trading, market manipulation schemes, accounting and regulatory reporting frauds, and Ponzi schemes and other investor frauds.  The Task Force works in close coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to uncover and prosecute these financial frauds. Complex Frauds and Cybercrime The Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of some of the most sophisticated fraud and cyber cases in the country, many of which are international in scope.  The Unit’s fraud cases involve individual and corporate defendants across a wide range of subject areas, including health care fraud, consumer fraud, tax fraud, investment fraud, government contracting fraud, bankruptcy fraud, COVID-19 pandemic fraud, corporate malfeasance, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations.  The Unit’s cyber cases involve national security investigations targeting nation-state and nation-state-sponsored actors, cryptocurrency hacks and scams, ransomware, darknet markets, and computer intrusions targeting stolen credentials, financial information, and confidential business information and technology.  The Unit works closely with multiple law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Health & Human Services-OIG, and the New York City Department of Investigation, as well in coordination with other U.S. Government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division and Criminal Division. Public Corruption The Public Corruption Unit works, in close partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal, state, and city investigative agencies to maintain and protect the integrity of all levels of government. The Unit oversees the investigation and prosecution of corruption crimes committed by elected and appointed officials, government employees, and individuals and companies doing business with the city, state, and federal government, as well as campaign finance offenses. Corruption crimes investigated by the Unit include bribery, embezzlement, and frauds committed against local, state, and federal government agencies. Illicit Finance and Money Laundering The Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit aggressively pursues criminal actors, networks, and entities that threaten the integrity of the U.S. financial system through exploiting U.S. financial institutions, broadly defined to include traditional banks as well as formal and informal money transmitters, fintech companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and broker-dealers.  In pursuit of this mission, the Unit focuses on three key areas, each of which implicate significant illicit financial threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing the United States financial system: (1) Bank Secrecy Act violations; (2) sanctions enforcement; and (3) large-scale international money laundering networks.  The supervisors and staff assigned to the Unit also oversee the Office’s forfeiture program, including forfeiture actions and allegations filed in cases across the Criminal Division. In that capacity, the Unit has also pioneered the use of federal forfeiture laws to recover and return stolen art and cultural heritage property. Violent and Organized Crime The Violent and Organized Crime Unit investigates and prosecutes violent and sophisticated criminal organizations based in New York City and around the world.  By aggressively using the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, cooperating witnesses, and other investigative techniques, the Unit has successfully prosecuted countless leaders and members of notorious criminal enterprises, including nationwide violent gangs like the Bloods, Crips, and Latin Kings; neighborhood-based crews responsible for, among other things, shootings, robberies, drug trafficking, and fraud; La Cosa Nostra, or the Italian mafia; Eastern European and Eurasian criminal enterprises; and Asian and African organized crime.  The Unit is dedicated to bringing cases that will have a tangible impact on public safety in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, helping dismantle violent gangs and reduce gun violence in residential neighborhoods.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes unsolved or “cold case” murders, illegal firearms trafficking, labor union corruption, and other racketeering offenses committed by criminal enterprises, including alien smuggling and sophisticated frauds. Narcotics The Narcotics Unit is devoted to prosecuting narcotics-related offenses harming our communities locally, nationally, and internationally.  The Unit works closely with a variety of federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Customs and Border Patrol; local law enforcement agencies, including the New York City Police Department and the New York State Police; and local-federal partnerships, including, notably, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Strike Force and New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, to investigate and prosecute narcotics traffickers fueling the opioid crisis through the distribution of fentanyl and its analogues; dealers who traffic in cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other controlled substances; and those involved in the illegal diversion and distribution prescription painkillers.  The Unit maintains a particular focus on the victims of narcotics trafficking, including both the victims of drug poisonings as well as violence perpetrated by drug trafficking organizations.  The work of the Unit has led to significant seizures of controlled substances and proceeds from criminal activity, dismantled drug trafficking organizations from neighborhood gangs to international syndicates, interrupted the flow of money enriching large-scale drug traffickers, and rendered justice for victims of drug poisonings and drug-related murders and violence. Civil Rights The Civil Rights Unit is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of all criminal civil rights offenses.  Established in 2021, the Civil Rights Unit prosecutes deprivations of constitutional rights by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who abuse their authority.  The Unit also investigates and prosecutes human trafficking and sexual abuse offenses, as well as acts of violence or threats of violence that are motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  The work of the Unit also includes investigating and prosecuting the unlawful interference with reproductive health services, environmental crimes, and voting rights cases.  The Civil Rights Unit works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to advance its mission of using the criminal laws to protect civil rights. General Crimes All entry-level Assistant U.S. Attorneys (“AUSAs”) in the Criminal Division are first assigned to the General Crimes Unit, where they learn the various aspects of federal criminal prosecution and handle cases covering a range of subject matter, including violence and fraud.  In the Unit, AUSAs learn how to investigate, bring to trial, and handle appeals for criminal cases.  AUSAs in the Unit also handle the daily intake of cases referred to the Office by virtually every law enforcement agency within the District.  AUSAs are assigned to the various subject-specific senior units within the Office after their time in General Crimes. Appeals The Criminal Appeals Unit provides support to the Office by ensuring that submissions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are of the highest quality.  The Unit assists with writing briefs and motions and preparing Criminal Division AUSAs for oral arguments before the Second Circuit.  The Unit also provides guidance on legal issues arising in all phases of criminal prosecutions, advises the Office of developments in criminal law, and assists in the formulation of Office policies that address enforcement of that law.

psychologist Abraham Maslow . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] According to Maslow’s original formulation, there are five sets of basic needs that are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength). Typically, the hierarchy is depicted in the form of a pyramid although Maslow was not himself responsible for the iconic diagram. [ 4 ] The pyramid begins at the bottom with physiological needs (the most prepotent of all) and culminates at the top with self-actualization needs. In his later writings, Maslow added a sixth level of 'meta-needs' and metamotivation . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The hierarchy of needs developed by Maslow is one of his most enduring contributions to psychology . [ 7 ] The hierarchy of needs remains a popular framework and tool in higher education , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] business and management training, [ 10 ] sociology research, healthcare , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] counselling [ 13 ] and social work . [ 14 ] Although widely used and researched, the hierarchy of needs has been criticized for its lack of conclusive supporting evidence and its validity remains contested. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Historical development [ edit ] [ edit ] Maslow proposed his hierarchy of needs in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in the journal Psychological Review . [ 2 ] The theory is a classification system intended to reflect the universal needs of society as its base, then proceeding to more acquired emotions. [ 19 ] The hierarchy is split between deficiency needs and growth needs, with two key themes involved within the theory being individualism and the prioritization of needs. [ ] [ ] According to Maslow’s original formulation, there are five sets of basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem and self-actualization. These needs are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength) beginning with the physiological needs that are the most prepotent of all. If the physiological needs are fulfilled, a new set of safety needs emerges. If both the physiological and safety needs are fairly well gratified, the prepotent (‘higher’) need of love (both its giving and receiving) then emerges. The next need is esteem, and finally self-actualization . Maslow also coined the term " metamotivation " to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of basic needs and strive for constant betterment. [ 6 ] [ ] The hierarchy suggests a rigid separation of needs, but Maslow stressed that a need does not require being satisfied 100% before the next need emerges. Instead, “a more realistic description of the hierarchy would be in terms of decreasing percentages of satisfaction as we go up the hierarchy of prepotency”. [ 20 ] [ ] Pyramid [ edit ] [ edit ] Maslow's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid, with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom, and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top. However, Maslow himself never created a pyramid to represent the hierarchy of needs. [ 21 ] [ 4 ] [ 22 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] The most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called "deficiency needs" or "d-needs": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these "deficiency needs" are not met – except for the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Deprivation is what causes deficiency, so when one has unmet needs, this motivates them to fulfill what they are being denied. [ 23 ] [ ] The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as "relative", "general", and "primarily". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need "dominates" the human organism. [ 3 ] Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met. [ 24 ] In addition to his anthropological studies, Maslow drew on animal data that "studied and observed monkeys [...] noticing their unusual pattern of behavior that addressed priorities based on individual needs". [ 14 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Alternative illustrations of hierarchy [ edit ] [ edit ] In contrast to the well-known pyramid, a number of alternative schematic illustrations of the hierarchy of needs have been developed. One of the earliest, in 1962, shows a more dynamic hierarchy in terms of 'waves' of different needs overlapping at the same time. [ 25 ] As illustrated, the peak of an earlier main set of needs must be passed before the next 'higher' need can begin to assume a dominant role. [ ] Other schematic illustrations of the hierarchy use overlapping triangles to depict the interaction of the different needs. One such updated hierarchy proposes that self-actualization is removed from its privileged place atop the pyramid because it is largely subsumed within status (esteem) and mating-related motives in the new framework. [ 26 ] [ ] Needs [ edit ] [ edit ] Physiological needs [ edit ] [ edit ] Physiological needs are the base of the hierarchy. These needs are the biological component for human survival. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, physiological needs are factored into internal motivation. According to Maslow's theory, humans are compelled to satisfy physiological needs first to pursue higher levels of intrinsic satisfaction. [ 2 ] To advance higher-level needs in Maslow's hierarchy, physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a person is struggling to meet their physiological needs, they are unwilling to seek safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization on their own. [ ] Physiological needs include: Air , Water , Food , Heat , Clothes , Reproduction , Shelter [ 23 ] and Sleep . Many of these physiological needs must be met for the human body to remain in homeostasis . Air, for example, is a physiological need; a human being requires air more urgently than higher-level needs, such as a sense of social belonging. Physiological needs are critical to "meet the very basic essentials of life". [ 14 ] This allows for cravings such as hunger and thirst to be satisfied and not disrupt the regulation of the body. [ ] [ ] Safety needs [ edit ] [ edit ] Once a person's physiological needs are satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, family violence , childhood abuse , etc. and/or in the absence of economic safety – (due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities) these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security , grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe –  especially children who have disabilities. [ 27 ] Adults are also impacted by this, typically in economic matters; "adults are not immune to the need of safety". [ 14 ] It includes shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek safety before attempting to meet any higher level of survival. This is why the "goal of consistently meeting the need for safety is to have stability in one's life", [ 14 ] stability brings back the concept of homeostasis for humans which our bodies need. [ ] [ ] [ ] Safety needs include: Health Personal security Emotional security Financial security Love and social needs [ edit ] [ edit ] After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of belongingness . According to Maslow, humans possess an effective need for a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless of whether these groups are large or small ; being a part of a group is crucial, regardless if it is work, sports, friends or family. [ 23 ] The sense of belongingness is "being comfortable with and connection to others that results from receiving acceptance, respect, and love." [ 27 ] For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs or online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others according to Maslow. [ 2 ] Many people become susceptible to loneliness , social anxiety , and clinical depression in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies due to hospitalism , neglect , shunning , ostracism , etc. can adversely affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general. 
Mental health can be a huge factor when it comes to an individual's needs and development. When an individual's needs are not met, it can cause depression during adolescence. When an individual grows up in a higher-income family, it is much more likely that they will have a lower rate of depression. This is because all of their basic needs are met. Studies have shown that when a family goes through financial stress for a prolonged time, depression rates are higher, not only because their basic needs are not being met, but because this stress strains the parent-child relationship. The parent(s) is stressed about providing for their children, and they are also likely to spend less time at home because they are working more to make more money and provide for their family. [ 28 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Social belonging needs include: Family Friendship Intimacy Trust Acceptance Receiving and giving love and affection In certain situations, the need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure. In contrast, for some individuals, the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for belonging; and for others, the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs. [ 26 ] [ ] Esteem needs [ edit ] [ edit ] Esteem is the respect, and admiration of a person, but also "self-respect and respect from others". [ 27 ] Most people need stable esteem, meaning that which is soundly based on real capacity or achievement. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs. The "lower" version of esteem is the need for respect from others and may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The "higher" version of esteem is the need for self-respect, and can include a need for strength, competence, [ 19 ] mastery, self-confidence , independence, and freedom. This "higher" version takes guidelines, the "hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated". [ 3 ] This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related. [ ] [ ] [ ] Esteem comes from day-to-day experiences which provide a learning opportunity that allows us to discover ourselves. This is incredibly important for children, which is why giving them "the opportunity to discover they are competent and capable learners" [ 27 ] is crucial. To boost this, adults must provide opportunities for children to have successful and positive experiences to give children a greater "sense of self". [ 27 ] Adults, especially parents and educators must create and ensure an environment for children that is supportive and provides them with opportunities that "helps children see themselves as respectable, capable individuals". It can also be found that "Maslow indicated that the need for respect or reputation is most important for children ... and precedes real self-esteem or dignity", [ 23 ] which reflects the two aspects of esteem: for oneself and others. [ ] [ ] [ ] Cognitive needs [ edit ] [ edit ] It has been suggested that Maslow's hierarchy of needs can be extended after esteem needs into two more categories: cognitive needs and aesthetic needs. [ 3 ] [ page needed ] Cognitive needs crave meaning, information, comprehension and curiosity – this creates a will to learn and attain knowledge. [ 23 ] From an educational viewpoint, Maslow wanted humans to have intrinsic motivation to become educated people. People have cognitive needs such as creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. Individuals who enjoy activities that require deliberation and brainstorming have a greater need for cognition. Individuals who are unmotivated to participate in the activity, on the other hand, have a low demand for cognitive abilities. [ 29 ] [ ] page needed [ ] [ ] Aesthetic needs [ edit ] [ edit ] After reaching one's cognitive needs, it would progress to aesthetic needs to beautify one's life. This would consist of having the ability to appreciate the beauty within the world around one's self, on a day-to-day basis. [ 23 ] According to Maslow's theories, to progress toward Self-Actualization, humans require beautiful imagery or novel and aesthetically pleasing experiences. Humans must immerse themselves in nature's splendor while paying close attention to their surroundings and observing them in order to extract the world's beauty. One would accomplish this by making their environment pleasant to look at or be around. They might discover personal style choices that they feel represent them and make their environment a place that they fit well into. This higher level of need to connect with nature results in a sense of intimacy with nature and all that is endearing. [ 23 ] Aesthetic needs also relate to beautifying oneself. This would consist of improving one's physical appearance to ensure its beauty to balance the rest of the body. [ 23 ] This is done by making and finding ways one wants to dress and express oneself through personal beauty and grooming standards and ideas. [ ] [ ] [ ] Self-actualization [ edit ] [ edit ] "What a man can be, he must be.” [ 30 ] This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to the realization of one's full potential. Maslow describes this as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be. [ 31 ] People may have a strong, particular desire to become an ideal parent, succeed athletically, or create paintings, pictures, or inventions. [ 32 ] To understand this level of need, a person must not only succeed in the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation.  Self-actualization is understood as the goal or explicit motive, and the previous stages in Maslow's hierarchy fall in line to become the step-by-step process by which self-actualization is achievable; an explicit motive is the objective of a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically drive the completion of certain values or goals. [ 19 ] Individuals who are motivated to pursue this goal seek and understand how their needs, relationships, and sense of self are expressed through their behavior. Self-actualization needs include: [ 19 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Partner acquisition Parenting Utilizing and developing talents and abilities Pursuing goals Transcendence needs [ edit ] [ edit ] Maslow later subdivided the triangle's top to include self-transcendence, also known as spiritual needs. Spiritual needs differ from other types of needs in that they can be met on multiple levels. When this need is met, it produces feelings of integrity and raises things to a higher plane of existence. [ 33 ] In his later years, Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] Maslow tells us that by transcending you have a set of roots in your current culture but you are able to look over it as well and see other viewpoints and ideas. [ 36 ] By these later ideas, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself—for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite. [ 37 ] "Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos ." [ 38 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Criticism [ edit ] [ edit ] Blackfoot influence [ edit ] [ edit ] Maslow's early (1938) anthropological research included a fieldtrip to the Blackfoot people ( Siksika Nation ) in southern Alberta, Canada. Based on his observations of their peaceful and cooperative way of life (in contrast to American society), Maslow concluded that human destructiveness and aggression is largely culturally determined and “most probably a secondary, reactive consequence of thwarting of or threat to the basic human needs”. [ 3 ] However, claims have been made that Maslow had failed to acknowledge the influence of the Blackfoot philosophy in developing the hierarchy of needs. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] According to Kaufman , while acknowledging that Maslow learned much from the Blackfoot people, “there is nothing in these writings to suggest he borrowed or stole ideas for his hierarchy of needs”. [ 4 ] Without wishing to discredit Maslow, Blackfoot elders and scholars have argued that Maslow did not really understand the Blackfoot philosophy. "It is not that Maslow got the hierarchy wrong or upside down, it is rather that he did not understand the circular nature in which all beings in Siksika society are interconnected and integrated. They surround each other and needs are met through these connections". [ 42 ] [ ] [ ] Self-actualizing people [ edit ] [ edit ] Maslow studied people such as Albert Einstein , Jane Addams , Eleanor Roosevelt , and Baruch Spinoza , rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that "the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy". [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ ] [ ] Ranking [ edit ] [ edit ] Global ranking [ edit ] [ edit ] In a 1976 review of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, little evidence was found for the specific ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all. [ 45 ] This refutation was claimed to be supported by the majority of longitudinal data and cross-sectional studies at the time, with the limited support for Maslow's hierarchy criticized due to poor measurement criteria and selection of control groups . [ 45 ] [ ] [ ] In 1984, the order in which the hierarchy is arranged was criticized as being ethnocentric by Geert Hofstede . [ 46 ] In turn, Hofstede's work was criticized by others. [ 47 ] Maslow's hierarchy of needs was argued as failing to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on the improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality. [ 48 ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Criticisms towards the theory have also been expressed on the lack of consideration towards individualism and collectivism in the context of spirituality. [ 49 ] [ ] Sex ranking [ edit ] [ edit ] The position and value of sex within Maslow's hierarchy have been a source of criticism. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category, alongside food and breathing.  Some critics argue that this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this critique could apply to all of the basic needs. However, Maslow himself acknowledged that the satisfaction of sexual desire was likely linked to other social motives as well. Furthermore, it is recognized that physiological needs such as sex and hunger can be related to higher-order motivations. [ 26 ] [ ] Cultural and individual variations [ edit ] [ edit ] Although recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, as well as shared ordering of the way in which people seek and satisfy needs, the exact hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The most common criticism is the expectation that different individuals, with similar backgrounds and at similar junctures in their respective lives, when faced with the same situation, would end up taking the same decision. Instead of that, a common observation is that humans are driven by a unique set of motivations, and their behavior cannot be reliably predicted based on the Maslowian principles. [ ] [ ] The classification of the higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country. In a 1997 study, [ 50 ] exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen-item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War, and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of US citizens. [ ] Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs, since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs, while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ ] [ ] A study of the ordering of needs in Asia found differences between the ordering of lower and higher order needs. For instance, community (related to belongingness and considered a lower order need in Maslow's hierarchy) was found to be the highest order need across Asia, followed closely by self-acceptance and growth. [ 53 ] [ ] A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups. [ 54 ] A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age. [ ] The hierarchy of needs has been criticized from an Islamic point of view. The authors conclude that integrating the model into Islamic contexts requires a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the centrality of spirituality in human needs. They also say that the Islamic approach emphasizes balancing material and spiritual needs in all life situations, challenging Maslow's hierarchy for oversimplifying their interaction.

By Adam Edelman UPDATED: January 10, 2019 at 9:26 AM EST So much for “Better safe than sorry.” Carrying condoms has resulted in arrest for a growing number of women in New York, Vice magazine reported Tuesday. Experts say the issue may be contributing to a public health crisis in which sex workers are beginning to use condoms less frequently. In the incident cited by Vice, a New York woman was arrested and charged with “loitering for the purpose of prostitution” after an officer found a condom in her purse. The unnamed woman was wearing jean shorts and a “tight” shirt and had been standing outdoors for about 30 minutes. After she had a conversation with a “passing man,” an officer searched her bag, where he found a condom and $1.25 and arrested her, according to Vice. While condoms themselves are not illegal, police in many cities are allegedly using them as the basis for evidence of prostitution and arrest, a trend that public health experts say is happening more often as police continue to crack down on the time-old trade. “Despite the fact that most prostitution cases do not go to trial, condoms are frequently vouchered and cited in criminal court complaints and supporting depositions as arrest evidence in prostitution-related cases,” the authors of a prominent 2012 study conducted by sex worker advocate the PROS Network wrote. The study , “Public Health Crisis: the Impact of Using Condoms as Evidence of Prostitution in New York City,” goes on to say that “these policies and practices may have a dangerous impact on safer sex practices in general.” Nearly half the participants in the study who were involved in the sex trade said they had not carried condoms “out of fear that it may get them in trouble with the police or lead to their arrest,” PROS sociologists wrote. “For all too many people in the sex trade, the importance of safe sex is outweighed by the importance of avoiding police harassment, humiliation, sexual and physical abuse, and arrest, as well as the potential indirect consequences of arrest,” the study stated. New York City itself hands out more than 30 million condoms each year at clinics, health fairs and other centers through the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. But the distribution is nothing short of ironic, given that some key communities are now afraid to carry them. “Unfortunately, I can only carry one condom,” a New York sex worker told Human Rights Watch as part of the group’s 2012 study “Sex Workers at Risk.” “I can’t carry more, because if I have bad luck and the police catch me, they could put me in jail because police can use them as proof.” According to New York penal code, a person may be charged with prostitution if he or she “engages or agrees or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee.” Consequently, an arresting officer usually has to witness the person make an offer. But for a handful of other less-serious prostitution-related offenses, including “loitering for the purposes of engaging in a prostitution offense,” the evidence required for an arrest or charge is more circumstantial. State lawmakers have long fought to end the presence of condoms as evidence in criminal prostitution trials. Bills to curb use of contraception as evidence were introduced in New York state as early as 1999. But the bill has never passed the state legislature. It was most recently voted down in 2012.

There are "reasonable grounds" to believe that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said on Tuesday.   Francesca Albanese was speaking at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, where she presented her latest r eport , entitled ‘Anatomy of a Genocide’, during an interactive dialogue with Member States. “Following nearly six months of unrelenting Israeli assault on occupied Gaza, it is my solemn duty to report on the worst of what humanity is capable of, and to present my findings,” she said. “There are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide…has been met .” Three acts committed Citing international law, Ms. Albanese explained that genocide is defined as a specific set of acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. “Specifically, Israel has committed three acts of genocide with the requisite intent: causing seriously serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, and imposing measures intended to prevent birth within the group,” she said. Furthermore, “the genocide in Gaza is the most extreme stage of a long-standing settler colonial process of erasure of the native Palestinians,” she continued. ‘A tragedy foretold’ “For over 76 years, this process has oppressed the Palestinians as a people in every way imaginable, crushing their inalienable right to self-determination demographically, economically, territorially, culturally and politically.” She said the “ colonial amnesia of the West has condoned Israel's colonial settler project ”, adding that “the world now sees the bitter fruit of the impunity afforded to Israel. This was a tragedy foretold.” Ms. Albanese said denial of the reality and the continuation of Israel's impunity and exceptionalism is no longer viable, especially in light of the binding UN Security Council resolution , adopted on Monday, which called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Arms embargo and sanctions against Israel “I implore Member States to abide by their obligations which start with imposing an arms embargo and sanctions on Israel , and so ensure that the future does not continue to repeat itself,” she concluded. Special Rapporteurs and independent experts like Ms. Albanese receive their mandates from the UN Human Rights Council. They are not UN staff and do not receive payment for their work. Israel ‘utterly rejects’ report Israel did not participate in the dialogue but issued a press release stating that it “utterly rejects” Ms. Albanese’s report, calling it “an obscene inversion of reality”. “The very attempt to level the charge of genocide against Israel is an outrageous distortion of the Genocide Convention. It is an attempt to empty the word genocide of its unique force and special meaning ; and turn the Convention itself into a tool of terrorists, who have total disdain for life and for the law, against those trying to defend against them,” the release said. Israel said its war is against Hamas, not Palestinian civilians. “This is a matter of explicit government policy, military directives and procedures. It is no less an expression of Israel’s core values. As stated, our commitment to uphold the law, including our obligations under international humanitarian law, is unwavering .” ‘Barbaric aggression continues’: Palestine Ambassador The Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine to the UN in Geneva, Ibrahim Khraishi, noted that the report provides the historic context of genocide against the Palestinian people. He said Israel “continues its barbaric aggression” and refuses to abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ), issued in January, to take provisional measures in order to prevent the crime of genocide . Israel has also refused to abide by UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, including the one adopted on Monday, he added. “And this means that all recommendations in the report of the Special Rapporteur shall be implemented, and practical measures should be taken to prevent the export of weapons, to boycott Israel commercially and politically, and to implement mechanisms of accountability,” he said. Israeli settlement expansion Separately, the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Nada Al-Nashif, presented a report on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory during the period from 1 November 2022 to 31 October 2023. “The reporting period has seen a drastic acceleration , particularly after 7 October 2023, of long-standing trends of discrimination, oppression and violence against Palestinians that accompany Israeli occupation and settlement expansion bringing the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe,” she said. There are now around 700,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem, who live in 300 settlements and outposts, all of which are illegal under international humanitarian law. Expansion of existing settlements The size of existing Israeli settlements has also expanded markedly, according to the report by the UN human rights office, OHCHR . Approximately 24,300 housing units within existing Israeli settlements in the West Bank in Area C were advanced or approved during the reporting period - the highest on record since monitoring began in 2017. The report observed that policies of the current Israeli Government “appear aligned, to an unprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate this occupied territory into the State of Israel,” Ms. Al-Nashif said. Transfer of power During the reporting period, Israel took steps to transfer administrative powers relating to settlements and land administration from the military authorities to Israeli government offices, whose primary focus is to provide services within the State of Israel. “The report therefore raises serious concerns that a series of measures, including this transfer of powers to the Israeli civilian officials, could facilitate the annexation of the West Bank in violation of international law , including the Charter of the United Nations,” she said. ‘Dramatic increase’ in violence There was also a dramatic increase in the intensity, severity and regularity of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, accelerating their displacement from their land, in circumstances that may amount to forcible transfer. The UN recorded 835 incidents of settler violence in the first nine months of 2023, the highest on record. Between 7 and 31 October 2023, the UN recorded 203 settler attacks against Palestinians and monitored the killing of eight Palestinians by settlers, all by firearms. Of the 203 settler attacks, more than a third involved threats with firearms, including shooting. Furthermore, almost half of all incidents between 7 and 31 October involved Israeli forces escorting or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out attacks. Blurred lines Ms. Al-Nashif said the line between settler violence and State violence has further blurred, including violence with the declared intent to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their land .  She reported that in cases monitored by OHCHR, settlers arrived masked, armed, and sometimes wearing the uniforms of Israeli security forces. “They destroyed Palestinians’ tents, solar panels, water pipes and tanks, hurling insults and threatening that, if Palestinians did not leave within 24 hours, they would be killed,” she said. By the end of the reporting period, Israeli security forces had reportedly handed out some 8,000 weapons to so-called “settlement defence squads” and “regional defence battalions” in the West Bank, she continued. “After 7 October, the United Nations human rights office documented cases of settlers wearing full or partial Israeli army uniforms and carrying army rifles, harassing and attacking Palestinians, including shooting at them at point-blank range.” Evictions and demolitions Israeli authorities also continued to implement eviction and demolition orders against Palestinians based on discriminatory planning policies, laws and practices, including on the grounds that properties lacked building permits. Ms. Al-Nashif said Israel demolished 917 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank, including 210 in East Jerusalem , again one of the fastest rates on record.  As a result, more than 1,000 Palestinians were displaced. “It is noteworthy that out of the 210 demolitions in East Jerusalem, 89 were self-demolitions by their owners to avoid paying fines from the Israeli authorities. This epitomizes the coercive environment that the Palestinians live in,” she said. The human rights report also documented Israel’s ongoing plan to double the settler population in the Syrian Golan by 2027, which is currently distributed among 35 different settlements. Beside settlement expansion, commercial activity has been approved, which she said may continue to limit the access of the Syrian population to land and water.
