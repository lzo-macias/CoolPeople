When Black New Yorkers thrive, all New Yorkers thrive. This means a guarantee of safety, housing, access to a quality education and good jobs, and the ability to raise families without the constant surveillance of law enforcement or the child welfare system. However, all too often our inability to zero in on the specific issues impacting Black New Yorkers means that our solutions to structural and blatant racism are deeply insufficient. I am unapologetically pro-Black, pro-queer, pro-justice. As the next Council Member representing the historically Black neighborhoods of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, and Bedford-Stuyvesant, A Black Agenda for New York City charges the next iteration of leadership in New York City to center the needs of Black New Yorkers in governing—because I cannot do it alone. This agenda provides comprehensive recommendations for New York City leaders to tangibly improve the lives of Black residents across the five boroughs in the areas of Health & Wellbeing, A Green City, A World-Class Education, Housing for All, Dismantling the Carceral System & Ending Violence in Our Communities, and Economic Opportunity & Building Generational Wealth. The following priorities reflect the most urgent recommendations for Black New Yorkers that speak to the gravity of this moment: Put money directly in the hands of Black New Yorkers with baby bonds and a guaranteed paycheck; Put money directly in the hands of Black New Yorkers with baby bonds and a guaranteed paycheck; Create a pipeline for non-law enforcement union jobs for Black New Yorkers; Create a pipeline for non-law enforcement union jobs for Black New Yorkers; Pilot a basic income program in zip codes with the highest rates of gun violence; Pilot a basic income program in zip codes with the highest rates of gun violence; Launch a citywide truth and reconciliation process focused on race and reparations; Launch a citywide truth and reconciliation process focused on race and reparations; Build Black generational wealth and prevent displacement through community home ownership; and Build Black generational wealth and prevent displacement through community home ownership; and Create a city racial equity commission to evaluate every new policy and piece of legislation. Create a city racial equity commission to evaluate every new policy and piece of legislation. While this agenda is by no means all-encompassing, it seeks to offer a robust view towards transformation for the incredibly diverse Black community in New York City. In doing so, I provide city leadership with a roadmap for change that is unapologetically undoing generations of neglect, while lifting up centuries of our resilience. Yours, Crystal Our Current Moment In the midst of a pandemic that is killing Black people at more than twice the rate of other Americans [2] , a multiracial movement unapologetically defending Black lives, and one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime that has ignited white supremacists in full force, our political leadership in New York City must stand up and advance an Agenda for Black New Yorkers. As a Black queer woman and candidate for New York City Council, I look to represent a district that has had to bear the pain of gentrification and displacement of Black residents, the overwhelming burden of rapid development that was never intended for us, the destruction of a healthcare infrastructure, and the erosion of businesses who can no longer afford to stay in our community. When Black New Yorkers thrive, all New Yorkers thrive. This means a guarantee of safety, housing, access to quality jobs, and the ability to raise families without the constant surveillance of law enforcement or the child welfare system. However, all too often our inability to zero in on the specific issues impacting Black New Yorkers means that our solutions to structural and blatant racism are deeply insufficient. And yet, like always, still we rise. The 35th District is home to so much of what makes Black New York remarkable - Soul Summit in Fort Greene Park, Black-owned retail and restaurants along Fulton Street, Dance Africa at BAM, Afropunk at Commodore Barry Park, the Caribbean diaspora in full display on Utica Avenue, the West Indian Day Parade along Eastern Parkway, and so much more. The Agenda that our campaign lays out uplifts the needs unique to the 35th District, while focusing attention on what is essential to ensure Black New Yorkers can thrive across all five boroughs. In June 2020, in the midst of the raging pandemic and outpouring of solidarity with the movement for Black lives in the face of the deaths of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many other Black Americans who were killed by law enforcement and militia groups, our very own New York City Commission on Human Rights (NYCCHR) quietly released a report called Black New Yorkers on Their Experiences with Anti-Black Racism. In it, the Commission outlines the “inescapability” that Black New Yorkers feel when it comes to their experiences with anti-Black racism. Documenting the lived experiences of thousands of Black New Yorkers through interviews and focus groups, some of the recommendations of the Commission were as follows: Develop and advance legislation and other policy measures that will protect Black New Yorkers and other groups targeted for discrimination; Develop and advance legislation and other policy measures that will protect Black New Yorkers and other groups targeted for discrimination; Deepen and expand relationships with organizations serving Black New Yorkers and develop hyper-local programming in Black communities across the city in order to build awareness of the Commission, City Human Rights Law protections related to race and color discrimination and available remedies; Deepen and expand relationships with organizations serving Black New Yorkers and develop hyper-local programming in Black communities across the city in order to build awareness of the Commission, City Human Rights Law protections related to race and color discrimination and available remedies; Develop new strategies for addressing race-based discrimination and harassment in places of public accommodation across the city; and Develop new strategies for addressing race-based discrimination and harassment in places of public accommodation across the city; and Create programming for implementation in gentrifying neighborhoods to build understanding of how anti-Black racism operates in modern-day New York City. [3] Create programming for implementation in gentrifying neighborhoods to build understanding of how anti-Black racism operates in modern-day New York City. [3] Building from some of these recommendations, this Agenda represents the start of a forward-thinking, explicitly anti-racist and pro-Black vision for the empowerment and upliftment of Black New Yorkers. Now that two simultaneous pandemics our community has been experiencing are in plain sight—a global pandemic that is killing us and a lethal form of racism at the hands of law enforcement—there is no going back. Our city—and our District—must move forward by rectifying the inequities that got us here. As the next City Council Member for the 35th District, I will work with community leaders, organizations on the ground, and my colleagues in government to ensure A Black Agenda for New York City leads and informs the way we recover, rebuild, and reimagine a New York City that truly works for all of us. Definitions and Framework for This Agenda We unapologetically lead with race as the dominating experience that dictates the disparate outcomes that New Yorkers face. When we disaggregate experiences of inequity by race, Black folks fare the worst.

We center the experiences of those who are most marginalized in the Black community—poor Black people, gender non-conforming Black people, trans Black people, Black women and femmes, Black people with disabilities, Black sex workers, Black immigrants, undocumented Black immigrants, and Black people who are survivors of trauma and violence, to name a few. Each of these communities have different and unique needs. Yet as divergent as our experiences may be, the shared experience of race and racial injustice defines many of our lived experiences. “Black New Yorkers” are not a monolith.

Reparations, defined as “a system of redress for egregious injustices,” [4] guide our principles. Our solutions are focused on putting more resources in the hands of more Black people. Knowing that Black folks have been systematically left out and denied access to credit, capital, housing, material wealth, and services that they not only desire but also require for survival, we center this agenda on the redress for these deliberate policies of our past and present.

Centering Racial Equity: The Necessary Approach to Governing Government has long struggled to center racial equity as the primary lens through which policymaking and agenda setting take place. As a result, our solutions rarely result in measurably different outcomes in well-being for people of color, especially Black residents. In fact, in many cities, racial disparities are even more significant today than they were in the 1960s, and government has done little to intervene. [5] In 1963, the average wealth gap between white families and non-white families was $121,000, and by 2016 that gap had grown to over $700,000. [6] In the same timeframe, the earnings gap between whites and Blacks has remained stagnant; the homeownership gap between white and Black families has increased; and segregation continues to drive fundamentally different opportunities to education, employment, and opportunity. All too often, government policies (or lack thereof) that yield racially biased results are attributed to personal choices or chance—rather than to the clear and intentional actions of government actors. Perhaps no one describes this better than scholar Richard Rothstein who, in his book The Color of Law, describes with exacting precision that in city after city, racial segregation in housing is not “ de facto segregation”—or a result of private action—but rather the consequence far more insidious but no less destructive “ de jure segregation”—or explicit government activities undertaken with the intent to subjugate Black lives. [7] Right here in New York City, our own Mayor ascertained that New York City had the most racially segregated school system because of individual housing decisions that yielded racially homogenous neighborhoods. [8] The fact is that 87% of people stopped, questioned, and frisked were Black or Latinx at the height of a practice once deemed the cornerstone of an allegedly race-blind broken windows policing policy. [9] And the fact that the vast majority—57%—of heads of households living in shelters are Black is cited as individual flaws in the inability to attain a family-sustaining job. [10] The truth, however, is that government policy is the architect of these grave disparities, but governments consistently ignore their culpability or blame a perfect storm of individual choices as the root cause, rather than anti-Black racism—plain and simple. Governing from a lens of racial equity means that we do the difficult work of centering those at the margins, who have been most harmed by explicit government choices, and make explicit interventions to repair the ills of our past. For the purpose of this Agenda, that means that we unapologetically center Black New Yorkers. New leadership in New York City on the heels of a surge of energy in solidarity with the movement for Black lives opens up the possibility that New York can finally center racial equity in governing. Six Bold Recommendations for Black New Yorkers This agenda goes into policy recommendations in great detail in the areas of Health & Wellbeing, A Green City, A World-Class Education, Housing for All, Dismantling the Carceral System & Ending Violence in Our Communities, and Economic Opportunity & Building Generational Wealth. The following priorities reflect the most urgent of these recommendations that speak to the gravity of this moment: Put money directly in Black New Yorkers’ hands with baby bonds and a guaranteed paycheck. In 2016, Black households with children had one cent for every dollar held by white households with children. [11] Further, household wealth is an indicator of education, employment, and other opportunities throughout our lifespan. For too long, Black people have been shut out and left behind by racist policies and practices across all levels of government. As a result, “it will take 228 years for the average Black family to catch up to the wealth of an average white family today, and that’s only if conditions improve immediately.” [12] Putting cash in the hands of Black New Yorkers will only make a dent in the damage caused, but it’s a good start. With baby bonds for all children born into families with household incomes of 0 percent to 30 percent Area Median Income (AMI), and a paycheck guarantee—both upheld by public banks and Community Development Financial Institutions (CFDIs), our city can set Black families up for success in the long-term, while repairing the ills of the past.

Economic Opportunity & Generational Wealth Building Create a pipeline for non-law enforcement union jobs for Black New Yorkers. Unionized public sector employment has been a reliable pathway to the middle class and wealth-building for so many Black Americans. In New York City, New York State, and across the United States, Black people are the most highly unionized group than any other racial or ethnic demographic. [13] And yet, as evidenced by the fight to defund the NYPD this summer, the fact that many Black New Yorkers currently serve in law enforcement has been used as the primary scapegoat as to why we cannot defund punitive city agencies because doing so would harm Black communities. New York must create a new pipeline for sustainable, unionized employment within city government for Black New Yorkers who are currently in law enforcement roles, and Black New Yorkers who have been shut out of sustainable employment—Black trans women, Black folks who have been incarcerated, and other Black New Yorkers facing the greatest barriers to employment.

Economic Opportunity & Generational Wealth Building Pilot a basic income program in zip codes with the highest rates of gun violence. Taking a public health approach to gun violence means recognizing that many of its root causes are inherently linked to wealth and the well-being of individuals—including poverty, income inequality, lack of opportunity and under-resourced services. [14] The injury, pain and trauma of violence impacts the physical and mental well-being of communities, intergenerationally concentrating poverty among Black New Yorkers facing the greatest burdens, while impacting healthy habits and increasing rates of premature death, high medical costs and decreased productivity. Likewise, many communities plagued by gun violence have faced generations of economic disinvestment, including decreased job opportunities and business investment. [15] Globally and nationally, basic income programs have been proven to work: cash transfers are spent judiciously and frequently lead to significantly higher economic gains compared to money invested. [16] A basic income program in communities whose fabrics have been frayed by gun violence would provide an additional opportunity for families to secure housing, put food on the table and reduce the anxiety associated with being unable to afford daily necessities that so frequently leads to violence and cycles of trauma. [17] This program, coupled with a targeted block-by-block gun removal initiative, will usher an end to gun violence.

As attorney, Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, Founder of The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and MacArthur “Genius Grant” Recipient Bryan Stevenson says, “We have committed ourselves in this country to silence about our history, to ignorance about our history, to denying our history. And that’s the first part of this relationship that has to be repaired. We’ve got to be willing now to talk honestly about who we are and how we got here.” [18] Since the 1970s, governments around the world have established truth and reconciliation commissions to address the harm they have caused to their own citizens, like Reconciliation Australia, which was established as the national body for reconciliation in Australia. [19] While we hope for a national truth and reconciliation process as a country to heal from the enduring nationwide legacy of genocide and slavery [20] , we can start this process as a city. From the ills of the racist and misguided War on Drugs to widely practiced policies like ‘Stop, Question and Frisk’ to the surveillance and removal of Black children from Black parents and families, our city’s own government has committed undue harm to Black New Yorkers. Other states and cities have taken this approach, with North Carolina establishing a commission in 2000 to create a record of and assess the impact of the 1898 massacre and successful coup d’etat by white supremacists in Wilmington, NC and Oklahoma creating a commission to assess and create a historical account of the 1921 Tulsa massacre. [21] The time to illuminate the ills of our shared past is now so that we can acknowledge the generational pain and center the experiences of those who have had to bear the most harm.

Build Black generational wealth and prevent displacement through community home ownership. Countless Black homeowners across the five boroughs are struggling to maintain their homes due to systemic barriers, predatory practices, and rising costs. For seniors on a fixed income, the prospect of keeping one’s home is even more elusive. All the while, many Black New Yorkers would love the opportunity to purchase homes in historically Black neighborhoods, but cannot--the inaccessibility of mortgage loans being just one reason. [22] Despite the threat of deed theft running rampant in Black communities [23] , there are still homeowners looking to sell to a legitimate buyer. New York City must pilot a program that allows Black homeowners who are interested in passing their homes onto prospective Black buyers - who, more often than not, may be longtime local residents - into a rent-to-buy program. Prospective owners would have the opportunity to rent from the homeowner through the duration of the mortgage, without facing discriminatory lending practices; the seller would no longer have the burden of costly payments to maintain their home; and Black-owned assets remain in Black hands, curbing displacement and keeping communities whole.

See more recommendations on Housing for All . Housing for All Create a city racial equity commission to evaluate every new policy and piece of legislation. Past New York City mayors and City Councils have made varying—and at best, clunky—attempts at centering racial equity as core to their agenda-setting strategies. Efforts like the New York City Young Men’s Initiative were an important first start, but much more must be done to ensure real accountability for the government to set policy and advance legislation through a racial equity lens. Currently, our City Council passes legislation and city agencies enact rules without a uniform, evidence-guided discussion of the possible racial impact of changes to city law. And while a consensus is forming that supports reviewing the racial impact of land use decisions, all laws passed in any government have the potential to be written or enforced in a manner that slights one or more racial groups—something Black New Yorkers know all too well. As such, we must fully fund and create a racially diverse commission of social science experts that can collect germane data and evaluate every new rule change and bill, and specifically detail both the new policy’s potential impact on various racial groups and how to ensure equitable enforcement. This commission should be part of the legislative and rulemaking review process and must submit a racial equity statement before a bill receives a committee vote or a rule change is enacted. The commission should also consult experts from germane disciplines and community organizations during the racial equity statement drafting process to ensure expert understanding of how enforcement currently works and how it might hamper any attempts at anti-racist policymaking. Once the commission is established and has a clear process to evaluate new policies, it should also begin reviewing the city charter and city law, in tandem with the Law Department, to identify potentially racist laws already on the books; conduct a rigorous analysis to determine whether each law has been enforced in a racist manner; and suggest legislative fixes that will ensure each law is implemented in an anti-racist manner.

Health and Well-Being Black New Yorkers deserve to benefit from our city’s world-class health infrastructure and yet health outcomes for Black New Yorkers are oftentimes the worst. Because of systemic neglect, poor housing conditions, proximity to air pollution, lack of access to green spaces, and the shuttering of hospitals in communities of color, chronic illnesses like breast cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke mortality are not only disproportionately higher for many Black people but also often diagnosed at a later age than their white counterparts. [24] In light of the burden that Black New Yorkers had to bear throughout the Covid-19 pandemic,  our approach to health and well-being for our communities must focus on a systems-level approach. COVID-19 Response Increase COVID-19 testing sites, and access to vaccination and pandemic-related care in predominantly Black communities through community-based responses. Our response to Covid must continue to center the communities impacted the most—Black New Yorkers who have continued to experience the ills of social determinants of health. In addition to a racially equitable approach to ensuring access to testing and vaccines, we must provide culturally competent education to increase awareness of testing and vaccine availability. The onus must be on the leadership of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Health and Hospitals (H+H) and state officials to ensure fair and equitable inoculation, counseling, outreach for and distribution of vaccines in Black neighborhoods. Our city’s existing healthcare institutions, leadership and overall public health strategy must center racial equity as its core strategy to put an end to the pandemic. Engage in direct outreach with trusted messengers to build trust in the vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy in communities of color, and in particular in Black communities, has been well-documented. [25] After hundreds of years of medical experimentation, false public health information knowingly distributed to Black communities and outright racism from healthcare institutions that is still the reality facing so many Black New Yorkers today, it's no surprise that Black communities are less trusting of the vaccine. The city must continue to build trust with Black communities through providers of color, credible community messengers and deferring leadership to trusted experts in our community. Growing a Healthcare Workforce that is Ready to Serve Black New Yorkers Create a mental health corps of culturally competent providers to support grieving families and communities. There have been countless tragedies because of the compounding experience of loss brought on by COVID-19. As a result, our communities are traumatized—and, in many ways, retraumatized—by preventable deaths and other experiences of pandemic-related loss. New Yorkers, especially Black New Yorkers, must be able to receive mental health services free of charge, from culturally competent providers who they trust. The city must create a mental health corps of trained providers who can support New Yorkers with the services they need, free of charge. While premium services like TalkSpace provide mental health services at users’ fingertips, there are few options for people who cannot pay for mental health services out of pocket, or who do not have employer-sponsored health insurance—and even fewer options for young people who might be covered through a family member or guardian. A New York City Mental Health Corps of providers who are able to serve New Yorkers of color would provide on-demand services that help meet folks’ needs. Develop a citywide doula program so that all people giving birth can access a doula, regardless of their ability to pay. A key factor for Black women to give birth and receive the medical advocacy they need is the ability to benefit from the presence of a birth advocate, like a doula. There is a wealth of evidence that demonstrates the benefit of doula care, especially for Black women who are giving birth. [26] In spite of their documented benefits, most people who seek doula care pay for this service out of pocket. New York City must expand affirming doula care to improve mortality disparities in healthcare. Create a pipeline of Black birthworkers, nurses, midwives and OB-GYNs who are prepared to end Black maternal mortality. In New York City, from 2006 to 2010, Black women were 12 times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. [27] While Black women aren’t significantly more likely to develop conditions like hemorrhages & preeclampsia, they are more likely to die from them. All signs of the cause of this point to medical racism—even when all factors are controlled for, unequal treatment of providers towards Black women are abysmal. And yet, a recent study found that when Black babies are delivered by Black doctors, their mortality rate is cut in half. [28] In partnership with academic institutions like the City University of New York, and New York City Health+Hospitals (H+H), New York City must invest in the pipeline of Black healthcare providers who are prepared and eager to serve Black folks, especially those who are pregnant and/or giving birth. Train Black healthcare workers who are ready to serve Black LGBTQ+ communities, with a focus on transgender and non-binary Black New Yorkers. In spite of all of the progress that New York has made on providing affirming healthcare to LGBTQ+ communities, and communities of color in particular, healthcare remains a luxury for so many queer and trans Black New Yorkers. Black healthcare providers must be trained to serve queer and trans Black communities who are among the most neglected by our healthcare system. Require that all residents and healthcare providers being trained at H+H are evaluated on their competency to serve Black patients. While H+H offers training to physicians system-wide, the city must increase the reach and efficacy of a core curriculum that teaches cultural humility in providing access to care. H+H must also institute more rigorous benchmarks for anti-racist trainings in healthcare for all providers, and DOHMH must expand the availability of trainings to all providers beyond our public hospital system. We must also hold physicians accountable to ensure and devise a robust metric - one that incorporates clear accountability measures like open liability insurance claims or preventable patient deaths - to suspend bad actors and those who have a history of ignoring patient needs. Grow the number of Black-owned caregiving co-ops to provide homecare services. The care economy is among the fastest growing in the nation, and is made up of mostly women of color—and Black women in particular—who provide needed services to people with disabilities or who are aging. Homecare agencies are notoriously poorly managed, and leave workers of color who dominate the industry with low wages and little opportunity to collectively bargain. Most recently, home care workers in New York State lost a battle to get paid their due time, as the New York State Court of Appeals determined that home care workers who work 24-hour shifts only needed to get paid for 13 hours of their time. [29] Our city must invest in worker-owned cooperatives of caregivers so that workers themselves can set labor standards and earn a livable wage. Curtailing Health Disparities and Expanding Access to Healthcare Expand access and provider competency to deliver affirming healthcare to Black transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) folks. The five boroughs need more TGNC providers to offer holistic, trans and gender-affirming healthcare. Providers like Callen-Lorde Community Health Center are overwhelmed with demand, which is a signal to our city that we must increase the supply of qualified providers to serve our communities. DOHMH and H+H must expand the pool of providers by training more community health workers, physicians, nurses, social workers and more who are Black and TGNC themselves, or who are able to provide affirming care to Black TGNC folks. Expand the reach of community clinics trusted by Black communities, particularly for those that specialize in STI rapid testing and prevention. In June 2019, the city opened a STI rapid testing site that specifically focused on testing and prevention of STIs among queer and trans folks of color. [30] The city must continue to expand community-focused care models to address disproportionately high HIV and STI positive rates experienced by Black folks. Expand school based health centers and expand comprehensive sex education. It is well established that school-based health centers provide essential  healthcare that many communities of color are otherwise locked out of. [31] The city must expand school based health centers beyond the 387 schools that already have them, and ensure that providers build trust with families, parents and guardians so young people access the care they need. [32] New York City must also expand comprehensive sex education so young peeople receive medically accurate, age-approrpirate, comprehensive sexual health education that is LGBTQ+ inclusive, every grade, every year. Increase funding of research focused on health equity and health disparities to then implement recommendations for a more patient-centered healthcare system. While the city reports on an annual plan for equitable healthcare through efforts like Take Care New York, the availability of disaggregated, real-time data is sparse. [33] Given the grave health disparities experienced by Black New Yorkers, our city must invest in real-time populations research focused on the needs of Black folks in our city. Food Sovereignty and Food Justice Bolster food sovereignty citywide. The pandemic has surfaced the fragility of New York City’s food systems. Before COVID-19, nearly 1.2 million New Yorkers were already food insecure, which accounted for what the Food Bank of New York City defines as a “Meal Gap” of more than 201 million missing meals across the five boroughs. [34] Mutual aid organizations across New York City have filled critical gaps since the beginning of the pandemic, especially for Black New Yorkers who have been hit the hardest by not only the pandemic, but by the economic instability that has resulted. [35] The city has tremendous power over food procurement, and therefore a stake in food sovereignty. In spite of advocacy organizations’ attempts at providing direct relief to undocumented workers, many Black undocumented folks are disconnected from services and do not otherwise qualify for SNAP or other forms of relief. Our city must create a supplementary food voucher system for New Yorkers experiencing food insecurity who are left out of SNAP, connect mutual aid grocery efforts and support shared infrastructure at scale, contract with food providers owned and operated by people of color and immigrant communities who can provide food recipients with culturally relevant food options, and expand community fridges managed by non-profit organizations, mutual aid groups and trusted local providers to ensure New Yorkers have the right to healthy, sustainably produced and culturally appropriate food. End food apartheid. It is not mere coincidence that predominantly Black communities within Harlem, Brooklyn and South Bronx are home to New York City’s food deserts. In these same areas, where income levels are below average, food deserts are linked to higher rates of diabetes and lower rates of physical inactivity. Simply put, we must create an equitable system of food access for all communities, especially the Black communities that have suffered for generations from a lack of access to high quality, healthy food products. To start, New York City must identify the top 20 food deserts in our city and work with Black-owned supermarket owners to partner with trusted community based organizations that serve the Black community, providing them with sufficient seed money to open up grocery stores that cater to their neighbors’ needs. The city should work to locate these supermarkets in a centralized location for each food desert to ensure ease of access for the communities, provide resources for the promotion and advertising of these new locations to local community members, facilitate dialogues with local community groups to identify partnerships between various nonprofits and these supermarkets (e.g. fitness and healthy eating initiatives), and conduct a periodic analysis of food access in the city to determine whether new food deserts have appeared. A Green City Black New Yorkers bear the brunt of infrastructure divestment and disinvestment, resulting in transit deserts, disproportionate proximity to air, sound and light pollution, an overconcentration of hazardous facilities (like waste transfer stations), a lack of green space and overall environmental neglect. It is long past time for policymakers to rectify a long history of neglect of Black New Yorkers by the city whose construction they literally bore on their backs. In 18th century New York, a dearth of potable water and lack of public sewers meant enslaved persons spent their days carrying clean water to their households and human waste away from them. [36] As the city developed public health infrastructure, Black New Yorkers were pushed to the margins of that very infrastructure, evidenced either by substandard services or living dangerously adjacent to the infrastructure built to serve other communities. The current public review regimen developed in the middle of the last century is in desperate need of reform. As noted in an in-depth analysis by the Municipal Art Society, over the past twenty years rezoning processes in New York City have led to whiter, more unaffordable neighborhoods. [37] And New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson’s proposed planning reform, issued in December 2020, calls out the need for corrective action to counter  “segregationist policies and the historic neglect of brown and Black neighborhoods.” [38] Public transportation and an accessible transportation infrastructure are fundamental tools in building a more equitable society. Yet even as Black New Yorkers would suffer disproportionately from the MTA’s proposed cuts and fare hikes in the face of extreme budgetary austerity, they already face numerous other obstacles. From historical disinvestment in their communities that has created a now inadequate route map to racist fare evasion enforcement, Black New Yorkers do not have equal access to the lauded transit system as the rest of the city. Environmental Justice Revise the city’s CEQR process. The City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process systematically considers the adverse environmental impacts that could result from a proposed discretionary land use action. The city’s guiding document, the CEQR Technical Manual, needs to be revised in the following ways: Projected outcomes that are required to be analyzed (reasonable worst-case development scenarios) should reflect real-world examples rather than overly optimistic computer models, and previously approved projects should be required to provide updated analyses to examine how accurate their projections turned out to be; Projected outcomes that are required to be analyzed (reasonable worst-case development scenarios) should reflect real-world examples rather than overly optimistic computer models, and previously approved projects should be required to provide updated analyses to examine how accurate their projections turned out to be; Projects should study more comprehensive and varied alternatives; Projects should study more comprehensive and varied alternatives; City rules should be revised to balance individual project goals with wider environmental concerns; City rules should be revised to balance individual project goals with wider environmental concerns; Proposals need to offer more detailed mitigation measures and add mechanisms to keep project sponsors accountable to the community; Proposals need to offer more detailed mitigation measures and add mechanisms to keep project sponsors accountable to the community; City planning processes must adhere to the 2018 Charter revision mandating more community input; [39] and City planning processes must adhere to the 2018 Charter revision mandating more community input; [39] and Environmental impact statements should be required to be more readable and accessible for public understanding and input. Environmental impact statements should be required to be more readable and accessible for public understanding and input. Transportation Fully fund and implement the already-passed Streets Master Plan. New York City’s Streets Master Plan intends to dramatically improve bus and bike transit infrastructure and create safer streets across the city, especially in Black neighborhoods that have suffered historic disinvestment. [40] Accelerate New York City Transit’s bus network redesign process currently underway and dramatically expand Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) plans. Black New Yorkers have the longest commute times in New York City, and overwhelmingly rely on the subway and buses to get to work. [41] Buses provide a relatively affordable and quick-to-implement way to provide better public transit for Black commuters. The 14th Street Busway has been an enormous success and expanding BRT routes to Central Brooklyn and other Black neighborhoods is essential to allowing people to travel for work and pleasure. [42] Create better bike infrastructure everywhere, but prioritize Black neighborhoods where NYPD is more likely to ticket Black bikers for riding on the sidewalk. [43] Not having safe places to bike in the street has given police even more opportunities to criminalize Black people. The placement of better bike infrastructure—such as protected bike lanes—in whiter and wealthier neighborhoods is yet another example of the city’s disinvestment in Black communities. [44] Ensure the Fair Fares Program is fully funded and expanded for all New Yorkers in need. Fair Fares recognized that subway and bus fare is too expensive for low-income people and cut the price by 50 percent. However, not all eligible people have applied for Fair Fares, and even a half-price round trip fare can still be costly for many. As New York City’s revenues recover from the current recession, the city should invest more in fare reductions—starting as a pilot targeted at Black communities if resources are limited. This action should be the first step toward eventually making public transit free for all, which would benefit all New Yorkers—and particularly Black New Yorkers. Reform Access-a-Ride. Currently there are countless independent and private operators under City Council oversight; the absorption of this transit network into a municipal service would create unionized and/or municipal jobs at a cost savings, and allow seniors with limited mobility, those living with disabilities, and other clients of Access-a-Ride to have more reliable transportation options . reliable transportation options Support the expansion of Black-owned dollar-van providers. Dollar vans are a lifeline for Black communities who live in transit deserts. Our city must equip dollar van companies with technology infrastructure so that riders can effectively “hail” rides, supporting riders to get access to transportation and support dollar van owners to make a living. Shift traffic enforcement out of the NYPD. More than $220 million of the NYPD’s bloated budget goes to enforcing traffic laws. [45] The reality of armed police handling traffic enforcement is that routine stops too often escalate to violence and even murder. It is no surprise that Black people suffer these fates during police traffic stops at disproportionate rates. Armed police should not handle traffic enforcement and the real savings from shifting these responsibilities from the NYPD can be reinvested in Black communities. Green Infrastructure Invest in green infrastructure, starting with Black communities. As Black communities in coastal and low-lying areas become more vulnerable to rising sea levels and stronger storms, and suffer from heat island effects due to rising temperatures and a relative lack of parks and trees, the importance of investing in green infrastructure grows. These investments in our collective sustainability and resiliency are disproportionately needed in Black neighborhoods—where they could produce tens of thousands of high-quality jobs—and can be funded largely through new borrowing under the city’s capital budget. [46] Upgrade NYCHA’s heat and hot water systems to modern and reliable electrical systems from their current state of disrepair. Existing heat and hot water systems in NYCHA developments create at worst dangerous and at best uncomfortable conditions for nearly all residents in the colder months of the year. [47] NYCHA residents deserve access to reliable, non-stop heat and hot water without worrying about their health and well-being while staying at home. Meet coastal and low-lying areas’ substantial resiliency needs. Our city must commit to meeting the resiliency needs of various coastal and low-lying areas to reduce flooding, whether by creating raised parkland, floodwalls, floodgates, or other projects. Reduce building emissions across New York City, creating cleaner air and reducing energy needs. We must i mplement deep energy retrofits for NYCHA and city-owned buildings, [48] provide (or coordinate the provision of) financing for retrofits for privately owned buildings, and continue expanding energy efficiency standards for all residential and commercial buildings. [49] , [50] Create new parks and plant new trees in Black neighborhoods. Black neighborhoods have far less park space per resident than white neighborhoods, which aid in reducing heat island effects and creating new space for recreation. We must identify available city-owned properties where new parks can be located while also planting trees where possible to ensure cleaner air for Black New Yorkers. far less heat island effects Invest in clean energy locally. Though the Green New Deal may seem to many to be out of the purview of the city, there is so much we can do to invest in clean energy at the city level. One initial move is toreplace expensive and heavy polluting peaker plants with cleaner alternatives, including community solar - which can be located right in New York City. expensive and heavy polluting peaker plants community solar A World Class Education For far too long, New Yorkers have come to accept the fact that our education system is deeply divided by race and class. In the last eight years, and largely through organizing efforts of student and student-parent led organizations like Teens Take Charge, Integrate NYC and the Coalition for Educational Justice, our city has reconciled with the stark disparities in racial inequity in our city’s school system. It is now unfortunately common knowledge that New York City has the most racially segregated school system in the country. [51] While important steps have been made to begin to desegregate our city’s schools, expand early childhood education and invest in a diverse educator workforce, excellence in K-12 education must also mean that schools that are majority-Black are just as excellent and desirable as schools that are majority-white or majority-Asian American. New York City is more reliant on standardized testing for school admissions than any other school district in the country. [52] When policies like standardized tests, programs for “gifted” children and disciplinary practices yield deep disparities based on race, the policies themselves that attempt to create objectivity are in fact, racist policies that eliminate the prospect of education serving as a universal equalizer for Black students. With 1.1 million students and over 1,800 schools in the system, the impacts of this are devastating to Black students. In addition to standardized testing, Black students suffer from disproportionately racialized surveillance and discipline in New York City schools. In spite of an overall drop in school suspensions since Mayor de Blasio took office, racial disparities remain high, with Black students continuing to bear the brunt of school suspensions. [53] Disparities are particularly harsh for Black girls—during the 2018-2019 school year, there were 4,560 police interventions targeting girls in New York City public schools—Black girls represented 57% of all interventions, while representing only 25% of all girls. [54] An education system that is truly invested in equal opportunity for Black students in New York City is one that invests in their full needs and sees them as whole people. Ending School Segregation By Design Permanently end gifted and talented (G&T) programs. More than 75% of students in G&T programs are white or Asian. [55] Racial segregation in G&T programs was accelerated after former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein eliminated a more holistic assessment of students for G&T programs and replaced admissions with a single exam. [56] This change was almost immediate—in 2007, 31% of students admitted to G&T programs were Black; in 2008, the number was only 13%. [57] As a result of extreme racial segregation in housing based on race, G&T programs were also scaled back in majority-Black neighborhoods. As a result of the efforts of New York City’s School Diversity Advisory Group (SDAG), Mayor De Blasio announced that the city would administer G&T for one final time in 2021, on the road towards elimination of the program. As the next Mayor and City Council enter into leadership, G&T must be permanently eliminated and codified into law to ensure it never returns and our schools do not use similar tests to perpetuate racist programs like G&T. [58] Transform the middle school admissions process into a lottery. In December 2020, the DOE announced that it would pause selective screens in the middle school admissions process for one year, and instead lean on the early findings from a lottery system for entry into middle schools. [59] This decision must remain permanent, and build on the learnings from Brooklyn’s District 15 Diversity Plan that is already showing important successes at creating a more diverse, more holistic learning environment for students. [60] End the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and other high-stakes testing. As with most standardized testing, exams like the SHSAT yield racially disparate outcomes in New York City’s elite specialized high school system. In 2020, only ten Black students gained entry into Stuyvesant High School for the 2020 - 2021 academic year, up from seven Black students in 2019. Even though New York City’s schools are 70% Black and Latinx, the overall percentage of black and Hispanic students in New York’s eight so-called specialized high schools is only 11%. [61] We must start by abolishing the SHSAT and create a far more holistic approach to specialized high school admissions in New York City. Implement the full set of recommendations put forth by the School Diversity Advisory Group (SDAG). In 2019, students, education experts, advocates and researchers released the full set of recommendations from the SDAG, a task force charged with solving New York City’s enormous school segregation problem. SDAG put out over 60 recommendations for school desegregation, including all of the above items, and they must all be adopted by the DOE. [62] Although this is a work in progress, SDAG laid the foundation for racial transformation at schools, and this work must be embraced. [63] Expanding the Promise of Early Childhood Education Expand 3K citywide. Early childhood education is key for Black children in their development and learning, and nationally, only 54% of eligible Black children are served by programs like Head Start. As a result of the pandemic, the DOE paused in expanding 3K in New York City. We must invest in 3K expansion to all five boroughs, building on the success of Universal Pre-Kindergarten (UPK) to bring critical early childhood education to all New Yorkers. Build a universal childcare system in New York City. It has been well documented that early childhood programs like Head Start is a vital early childhood program for Black families and communities. [64] There is perhaps no greater moment than the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate how urgent truly accessible childcare is for families to thrive. We must expand the benefits of HeadStart, which have disproportionately beneficial impacts on Black children and families, and which is currently administered by the DOE in an attempt to build a seamless birth - 12th grade system, to all children in the five boroughs. Invest in Excellent Schools that Serve Black Youth Ensure the full promise of Fair Student Funding. Since 2007, New York City public schools have been funded in part by a weighted, student needs-based allocation formula known as Fair Student Funding (“FSF”) that currently accounts for approximately two-thirds of a school’s total annual budget. [65] In spite of its promise, FSF has never been fully implemented across New York City Schools. In order to ensure that Black students have the greatest opportunity to succeed at thriving schools, we must ensure full implementation of FSF so resources are allocated to students in greatest need. Expand community schools with the goal of serving more Black students. Community schools are a proven model to provide holistic education and much-needed services to New York City students. [66] We must expand community schools across the system, with a focus on predominantly-Black communities who would benefit most from this model of integrative education. Expand Afrocentric and Indigenous education for all students. Afrocentric  curricula, which emphasizes education about African nations and the African heritage of many Black students, works to empower Black children and teach them to be proud of where their families came from, a split from the Eurocentric approach in many city schools that many Black New Yorkers encountered when they went to school. Likewise, inclusion of indigenous history would ensure a more comprehensive and historically accurate understanding of the long-misinterpreted history of the people whose land we currently occupy, including pre- and post-1900 context. To work toward racial equity in our city’s school system, schools must expand their application of an Afrocentric and indigenous approach to all students, not just Black and indigenous students. The “default” in any school should not be a white, Eurocentric approach where students learn about the Western world and teachers use examples from Western cultures to teach students about everything from math to music without an acknowledgment of African nations or indigenous culture, and we have shaped everything from literature to modern popular music to American cuisine. Expand affirming LGBTQ+ education for all students with a focus on Black leadership in the queer and trans liberation movement. Stonewall was a police riot started by Black and Latinx trans women in New York City. Young people, and young people of color in particular, must have the opportunity to learn about the history of the queer and trans liberation movement, especially placing the unique story of activism in New York City into context. Expand the workforce ready to serve Black students, including NYC Men Teach. We must invest in creating an educational workforce that reflects the student body - one where young students can see a teacher who looks like them and who understands and respects their culture and background. Efforts like NYC Men Teach work to identify Black men and men of color and recruit them to become teachers in our city schools. We must use city resources to expand NYC Men Teach, adding hundreds of more Black male teachers and male teachers of color into the teacher pipeline, and work to strengthen mentoring and counseling programs by providing clear pathways to access these jobs for Black New Yorkers. Create Positive Learning Environments for Black Students in Schools New York City schools need to be decriminalized. Black students are exponentially more likely to receive school suspensions than their white counterparts. Trauma-informed care models— including restorative justice and combating the adultification of student discipline—will allow Black children to be treated as children and the primary clients, not enemies, of the education system. Working with the Mayor’s office, education advocates, students and parents, I will look to implement the following concrete outcomes for public school students: Eliminate vague and subjective dress codes. Black girls are adultified simply for being who they are. The New York City Department of Education must eliminate vague and subjective dress code policies that often target Black students, and especially girls, young women, femmes and gender non-conforming youth, in schools. Remove School Safety Agents (SSAs) from schools and support just transition to other municipal jobs. New York City must work towards removing all police from schools while supporting a just transition for the 5,000 municipal workers who serve as SSAs into other municipal, unionized, non-law enforcement jobs in similar civil service titles. Decriminalize learning environments. All New York City schools must eliminate zero tolerance policies, remove metal detectors and other instruments of surveillance; Eliminate suspension and expulsion. Black youth face the most disproportionate rates of school discipline of any other racial group in NYS schools . [67] Even as the city has seen a significant decline in overall suspensions, racial disparities have remained a constant.  This is especially true for Black LGBTQ students and Black students with disabilities. [68] I intend to work with student groups, educators, and the Mayor’s office to equip schools with the tools to eliminate suspensions as a tool for discipline. Implement a citywide suspension and expulsion review policy. Our city must identify the schools that disproportionately suspend Black students and publicly post the information. Provide full legal representation to students in need. On the path to eliminating school suspensions, New York City must create a formalized, fully-funded pilot program in a handful of DOE schools with the highest rates of suspension to connect either law students from public and private universities based in New York City or city public defenders with DOE students undergoing the suspension or expulsion process to provide them with representation throughout the process - akin to the Suspension Representation Project at NYU Law; and Create a bill of rights for all students subjected to the suspension or expulsion process that notifies them of their rights (including their ability to seek representation). A Bill of Rights would specify the types of activity that is and is not grounds for discipline, details information on the suspension and expulsion process in clear terms, and provides resources like legal aid or psychological counsel that they may. Housing for All Housing is a human right; period. After years of racist housing policies and racialized disinvestment and neglect in our city’s public housing, it’s going to take a bold shift in our thinking and large-scale reinvestment to right the wrongs of our past. From the monstrous demand for vouchers and the broken housing lottery system to the failures of de Blasio’s Housing New York plan, and the years-long waiting list for NYCHA, we are failing low- and middle-income New Yorkers who need a safe, secure, affordable place to live. We need to stop selling city-owned property to developers and keep public land in the public’s hands. The overwhelming cause of homelessness is a lack of affordable housing options, and the issue is highly racialized, with Black New Yorkers making up an astonishing 58 percent of the homeless shelter population. [69] Over the last several years, we have seen the abysmal lack of moral courage by our city’s leadership to build truly affordable housing for New Yorkers experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness. This administration has spent the last several years focused on building and preserving housing that has never been accessible to people experiencing homelessness. When thinking about community safety, we need to put the welfare of Black trans women and non-binary femmes at the center of these conversations. This includes advocating for an overdue housing voucher program for LGBTQ youth—long promised by the de Blasio administration. A Local Homes Guarantee Pass a Homes Guarantee at the local level. [70] Every person living in our city should have access to safe, permanently affordable housing. Black New Yorkers disproportionately face homelessness, live in public housing that has long been neglected and underfunded, spend more than 30% of their income on housing, and are still feeling the effects of a long legacy of racist housing policy. We need bold, large-scale investment in affordable housing, especially for Black New Yorkers, to ensure that housing is a human right. Increase the Supply of Housing that Will Benefit Black Residents Grow the social housing sector. As we continue to face the ramifications of this pandemic and a volatile economy, we need to shift our focus and center housing as a social good. Social housing aims to create affordable housing that shields housing from market forces, promotes a vision of social equity, and gives residents democratic control over their own housing. Some of these ideals are currently incorporated in part by public housing and limited equity cooperatives, but we must encourage the growth of this model by empowering nonprofits and tenants to acquire housing developments, expanding tenants’ rights and protections, and target risky and predatory behavior by landlords and lenders. Fully fund public housing. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) has been criminally underfunded and neglected by all levels of government, and low-income Black New Yorkers have needlessly lived in dangerous conditions for years as a result. There must be a tremendous overhaul to the infrastructure that governs maintenance and capital repairs at NYCHA. I will continue to work closely with NYCHA residents and my colleagues across local, state, and federal government to ensure that we unapologetically advocate for the massive reforms needed to ensure that every NYCHA development has the resources they need to ensure a quality standard of living for all residents. That starts with immediately repairing all units with lead-based paint, prioritizing households with children. Establish a network of Community Land Trusts to take ownership of derelict buildings and private properties with uninhabitable living conditions. The first Community Land Trust (CLT) in the United States was founded over fifty years ago by Black farmers in the Jim Crow South who faced eviction for their involvement in civil rights activities. [71] Today, Black folks face some of the highest eviction rates in New York City, with tenants living in majority Black zip codes being three times more likely to be evicted than those living in majority white zip codes. [72] The city has had various iterations of programs geared towards public ownership of abandoned private properties and those with tenants living in hazardous conditions; yet so many tenants are still living in uninhabitable conditions with predatory landlords who appear on the NYC Public Advocate’s Worst Landlords List year after year. [73] Additionally, the New York City Department of Housing, Preservation and Development (HPD) has at least 225 buildings in its Alternative Enforcement Program (for FY2020) that meet a certain threshold of “hazardous” and “immediately hazardous” violations per dwelling unit—conditions that no one should be subjected to living in day after day and in many cases, month after month and year after year. Other city programs like the Tax Lien Sale and Third Party Transfer notoriously target and disempower low-income Black homeowners by revoking ownership rather than providing assistance to sustain ownership, while CLTs empower communities with cooperative ownership and true affordability in perpetuity. [74] It is time government agencies stopped incentivizing private landlords to maintain hazardous building conditions through lenient programs that don’t keep tenants safe, and time we put the power in the hands of the people through intentional ownership opportunities. Expand housing options specifically for Black trans New Yorkers. Nationally, Black transgender people face the most severe housing insecurity among LGBTQ communities. [75] New York City has taken some steps to expand housing options for trans folks of color, including most recently via an effort put forth by Gays and Lesbians Living In a Transgender Society (GLITS). [76] New York City must continue to expand housing options for Black transgender folks across the five boroughs, following the model created by GLITS. Overhaul the Uniform Land Use Review Process to Center Racial Equity Require racial impact and equity statements for all proposed land use decisions. Every time the city decides to change how land is used multiple communities are impacted. The upzoning of a neighborhood could mean a change in the business culture of a neighborhood - jeopardizing Black-owned small businesses - or could mean a fundamental shift in the socioeconomic and racial demographics of a neighborhood given the types of housing or commercial land use proposed. As such, residents deserve to understand the full picture of how their homes may change if a land use proposal passes. Developers are already required to submit reports estimating the environmental impact of their projects. As such, the city should require a racial impact study for any land-use changes that also require an environmental review to understand the direct and direct impacts of the project as they relate to race and ethnicity, similar to Public Advocate Jumaane Williams’ bill Int. 1572-2019. [77] Additionally, developers who show that their project will have a strong impact on the racial and ethnic character of a neighborhood in any manner must also submit their plans to correct that impact and ensure an anti-racist development that does not harm specific groups and bolsters the local community. The City Planning Commission and all stakeholders in the ULURP process can then review these materials to determine whether the impact and suggested equity adjustments are satisfactory. Radically rewrite Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH). The MIH program is a disaster and has been completely ineffective. The program’s stated goal of creating a drastic increase in the number of affordable housing units is right, but unfortunately, the program is inherently flawed. The vast majority of units created are concentrated in areas that are facing unprecedented amounts of gentrification, while leaving more affluent communities starved for affordable housing. Furthermore, the definition of affordable is problematic as these units are priced at amounts that would seem astronomical to many New Yorkers in dire need of housing. We must radically revise MIH to expand affordability beyond 20% and retain public land for public housing, rather than continuing the privatization scheme that is woefully ineffective. Prioritize rezonings in wealthier neighborhoods to increase deeply affordable housing stock. Rezonings in our city have decimated communities across the boroughs and have ignored meaningful input from local residents. Development projects, like Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park right here in District 35 have pushed longtime residents out and created chaos, endless construction, broken promises, and little accountability for those who remain. We must shift our focus of neighborhood rezonings from communities that are predominantly of color and instead increase the housing supply in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods. These neighborhoods can absorb the cost of building deeply affordable housing with premium market-rate rents, while low-income communities of color cannot. [78] Crystal will work with other council members and the new administration to identify as many as 12 of these neighborhoods and advocate for their rezonings to provide housing and community infrastructure for lower-income residents and residents experiencing homelessness. Create Long-Term, Permanent Housing Solutions for People Experiencing Homelessness Expand supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness who are in need of wraparound services. Since the 1980s, permanent supportive housing that incorporates affordable housing assistance and wraparound services like healthcare has continued year after year to prove a strong solution to homelessness. [79] After the Bloomberg administration ended permanent housing placements in exchange for limited housing subsidy programs, homelessness skyrocketed that the city eventually cancelled, effectively placing more than 10,900 families back in the shelter system. [80] We need to continue to finance and expand supportive housing programs for people experiencing homelessness, in conjunction with federal housing voucher programs, to reduce homelessness. We also must continue incorporating new wraparound services to ensure those experience homelessness are prepared for living and working in our current world. While the Human Resources Administration (HRA) and the Office of Supportive and Affordable Housing and Services (OSAHS) has resources for people experiencing homelessness for everything from obtaining public assistance to legal assistance to disability access, we must ensure HRA continues to audit its programs and identify shortcomings and areas for further growth while also working to inform individuals in supportive housing systems about the availability of various city programs. Strengthen enforcement of 15% set aside on city-funded projects. Under a recently passed bill, any rental building with more than 40 units must set aside at least 15 percent of units for people experiencing homelessness. [81] For developers who want to bypass the homeless set aside, they could eschew city funding or propose projects with fewer than 40 units - even though these projects will have higher city subsidies. Though the bill is projected to create 1,000 new apartments for people experiencing homelesness per year, we must ensure developers follow not just the letter of the law but also the spirit of it in working to create more housing for people experiencing homelessness. As such, we must work with HUD and the state legislature to identify available funding systems to create a capital development fund that goes toward providing even greater subsidies for developers who build this housing for those experiencing homelessness in their private development. We must also create a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure these units are not later flipped as market-rate units and remain in the housing pipeline for those experiencing homelessness. Dismantling the Carceral System & Ending Violence in Our Communities Black New Yorkers know what keeps our neighborhoods safe. For too long safety has been in the hands of the police and criminal justice system, who have systematically surveilled and criminalized black people. Black people are about 22% of NYC’s population and 54% of NYC’s daily jail population. [82] Reducing violence and recovering from harm means centering the leadership and needs of those most impacted. This can not be done within the current system. We must close the jails on Rikers Island without building new jails. To do so we must decarcerate and invest in community based resources. As we fight for a future without pre-trial detention we can not forget our currently incarcerated family and friends and must immediately address conditions of confinement. Demilitarize and Defund Law Enforcement Demilitarize and defund the NYPD. The NYPD’s budget must be cut by at least $1 billion, and these cuts must be related to core NYPD operations and practices and not just a symbolic shifting of funds. [83] This means instituting an immediate hiring freeze, cancelling new cadet classes and cutting the budget for the expansion of surveillance infrastructure. In defunding the police, we also must cut from the patrol budget. The NYPD has extended their reach into civic institutions where they have no place and frequently abuse those they interact with. Armed police officers must be removed from public transit, homeless outreach, and mental health response. [84] Demand greated police accountability. Police must be held accountable for abuses of power. New York City should end qualified immunity and allow people to recover monetary damages in civil lawsuits against police officers. [85] Remove indemnification clauses from union contracts. Through labor negotiations, we must remove any and all indemnification clauses from contracts with police unions. These clauses are what redirect public funds to cover the legal fees of police officers and shield officers from liability for their actions. Remove the discretion over police discipline from the NYPD. Time and time again, the NYPD demonstrates that it has no capacity to discipline police officers who harm and kill civilians, especially Black civilians. NYPD discipline should be determined by a completely independent body that has final decision-making authority. Invest in Community-Led Safety Decoupled from Law Enforcement Invest in community-based restorative justice with attention to addressing violent crimes. While there has been a sea change in focus on restorative justice practices as an ideal way to address harm, we must scale this model to address violent crimes. People who have caused harm must not be defined by the potentially worst thing they have done, and people who have experienced harm should have the opportunity to make decisions about what accountability looks like. Replace cops with community support through the expansion of Cure Violence. Time and time again, we have seen that our current punitive solutions for preventing and  intervening in violence put Black lives at risk. It has been well-established that violence is a public health issue, and it must be treated as such. [86] New York City has already expanded its focus on Cure Violence programs, which engage credible messengers and violence interrupters to mediate conflict, address violence before it begins, and hold community members through trauma and healing in moments when violence does erupt. Promising models such as the Brownsville Safety Alliance are already set to expand to other parts of the city. [87] Cure Violence must serve as our city’s governing model for violence interruption, engaging and hiring those closest to their communities as organizers, social workers and fully able to keep one another safe. Expand community safety efforts in the face of escalating violence faced by queer and trans Black communities. As of February 2021, three Black transgender women have already been killed simply because of their of identity. In the face of violence against Black transgender, non-binary and LGBQ communities, New York City must expand community safety efforts that do not involve law enforcement. Fund community security at scale. For decades, Black led organizations like the Audre Lorde Project, Life Camp and GMACC have advanced community solutions to reducing violence and increasing neighborhood security. The City Council must recognize their leadership as well as other community safety organizations and increase funding to their work. Expand Mayor’s Action Plan to all NYCHA developments. We must expand the Mayor’s Action Plan (MAP) to all NYCHA developments to invest in community driven responses to neighborhood issues. [88] Bolster ONS funding. We must increase funding to the Office of Neighborhood Safety (ONS) to expand the Crisis Management System to fund credible messengers to escalate conflicts and connect people to services such as the Anti-Gun Violence Youth employment programs and culturally competent mental health support. [89] Invest in the Real Well-Being of Black Children End ACS’ surveillance of Black children. We must fundamentally overhaul the New York City Administration of Children’s Services (ACS) to stop ending the disproportionate surveillance of Black children and refocus efforts by the New York City Administration of Children's Services, instead focusing on the root causes of entry into the child welfare system and systemic change. Strengthen access to informal kinship navigator training for all caretakers. We must ensure all caretakers are aware of all resources at their disposal, including financial assistance grants, and of all laws related to kinship care. Especially during this pandemic, Black families have disproportionately relied on informal kinship care as jobs, food and other necessities have become more scarce. However, resources for informal kinship caretakers are sparse and frequently inaccessible to families and caretakers most in need. As such, we should ensure all city-appointed caretakers can undergo city-administered training, with the help of groups like the NYS Kinship Navigator, that walks them through the kinship care process in New York, including available benefits offered by the state Office of Children and Family Services and ACS. The city can also expand subsidies and grants for families to access the statewide kinship navigator program or local kinship services. Provide temporary funding to keep families connected. As the COVID-19 pandemic keeps families apart, New York City should provide greater stipends to foster parents to help them support their children during the pandemic, including by financing greater access to technology (e.g. internet, tablets) to keep families and their networks connected. Work Towards Making Our City’s Jail System Irrelevant We must fundamentally transform our approach to criminal justice - moving from a punitive model to one focused on justice and rehabilitation. We cannot keep degrading and dehumanizing our neighbors who are currently incarcerated, more than half of whom are Black. Any way we slice it, jails, prisons and detention centers are no place for people. [90] At a minimum, we must: Close Rikers Island, the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center (aka “The Boat”) and borough-based jails; Close Rikers Island, the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center (aka “The Boat”) and borough-based jails; Decarcerate through legislative reforms and prioritize the reduction of the jail population and funding community based alternatives to incarceration and detention, including for violent felonies; Decarcerate through legislative reforms and prioritize the reduction of the jail population and funding community based alternatives to incarceration and detention, including for violent felonies; Eliminate all low-level offenses and support efforts to legalize marijuana; Eliminate all low-level offenses and support efforts to legalize marijuana; Eliminate sentences of less than a year served in city jails, as the majority of individuals serving these sentences have been convicted of a misdemeanor or non violent felony; [91] Eliminate sentences of less than a year served in city jails, as the majority of individuals serving these sentences have been convicted of a misdemeanor or non violent felony; [91] Decriminalize sex work and all related offenses (including decarcerating people arrested or jailed for sex work related charges); Decriminalize sex work and all related offenses (including decarcerating people arrested or jailed for sex work related charges); Eliminate ticketing for equipment violations; [92] Eliminate ticketing for equipment violations; [92] Invest in more Alternatives to Incarceration and Alternative to Detention programs, prioritizing programs with a trauma informed and restorative justice lens; [93] Invest in more Alternatives to Incarceration and Alternative to Detention programs, prioritizing programs with a trauma informed and restorative justice lens; [93] Advocate for the release of older individuals who are incarcerated; and Advocate for the release of older individuals who are incarcerated; and Support state reforms to release people incarcerated because of technical parole violations - the only population that has increased over the past five years as there have been steady decreases in the overall jail population. [94] Support state reforms to release people incarcerated because of technical parole violations - the only population that has increased over the past five years as there have been steady decreases in the overall jail population. [94] Support the Health and Wellbeing of People Held in City Jails On our pathway to closing city jails, we must ensure that the treatment of people being held is humane. At Rikers, 75 percent of people who enter the jail are addicted to drugs, with 20 percent addicted to heroin or painkillers. [95] Our city must radically shift how we provide mental health services and support implementation of community-based mental health respondents to remove any criminalization of people with mental health. We must define carceral health as a public health issue. This includes: Stopping the criminalizing of people criminalizing people with mental illness; Stopping the criminalizing of people criminalizing people with mental illness; Prioritizing those incarcerated and working in city carceral facilities for COVID-19 vaccinations, as they are at high risk of contracting and spreading the virus. [96] Prioritizing those incarcerated and working in city carceral facilities for COVID-19 vaccinations, as they are at high risk of contracting and spreading the virus. [96] Adopting a public health approach to addressing concerns that arise survival crimes, drug possession, and sex work; Adopting a public health approach to addressing concerns that arise survival crimes, drug possession, and sex work; Moving individuals incarcerated at the incredibly toxic and dangerous body of landfill and rubbish we call Rikers Island to a space that has documented reports of increased health issues from exposure to toxins; [97] Moving individuals incarcerated at the incredibly toxic and dangerous body of landfill and rubbish we call Rikers Island to a space that has documented reports of increased health issues from exposure to toxins; [97] Providing immediate and holistic healthcare to everyone in its jails and detention centers; Providing immediate and holistic healthcare to everyone in its jails and detention centers; Working with Correctional Health Services to provide expanded services to individuals at Rikers; Working with Correctional Health Services to provide expanded services to individuals at Rikers; Expand harm reduction based drug treatment in jails; Expand harm reduction based drug treatment in jails; Expanding access to methadone and buprenorphine in jails; Expanding access to methadone and buprenorphine in jails; Ensuring that everyone who comes into contact with the New York City Department of Correction is immediately connected to long term care in the community and gets extensive follow up and continuity of care at H+H; Ensuring that everyone who comes into contact with the New York City Department of Correction is immediately connected to long term care in the community and gets extensive follow up and continuity of care at H+H; Ensuring CHS and the city not only surpasses the Board of Corrections’s minimum standards but also individually assess and addresses the needs of incarcerated people, particularly those with disabilities; and Ensuring CHS and the city not only surpasses the Board of Corrections’s minimum standards but also individually assess and addresses the needs of incarcerated people, particularly those with disabilities; and Providing expansive and affirming care for transgender and gender non-conforming, non-binary and intersex people. Providing expansive and affirming care for transgender and gender non-conforming, non-binary and intersex people. End Gun Violence Alongside Directly Impacted Community Members Address youth violence with restorative justice solutions. Young people and emerging adults, disproportionately Black, are frequently victims of gun violence and over-incarceration. Young people must be at the center of the city’s mitigation efforts as they have been in cities all around the country, and the focus must be on peace and restorative justice. [98] Form a “Peace Book” pilot program in the 35th District. We must  empanel a youth task force and earmark funding for a ‘Peace Book’ to be piloted in Council District 35, developed by young members of the community and regularly updated. [99] The Peace Book will contain contact information for wraparound services, job opportunities, and funding for training and programming for young people. The Peace Book will also identify community members and organizations providing free or accessible health care, therapy, meals, and substance use disorder and other harm reduction programs. Form a civilian chaperone and mentorship program. Likewise, young people should have access to a safe passage to and from school. Instead of relying on armed law enforcement officers in subway stations and on school campuses, we should pilot a a civilian chaperone and mentorship program, training and employing recent NYC public high school graduates and CUNY students to act as credible messengers in public transit and on common school routes to encourage school attendance and ensure young students can commute safely. Engage in the largest gun buyback program in New York City. Historically, gun buyback programs have occurred at too small a scale and without proper targeting and incentivization, resulting in minimal reductions in gun violence. However, a citywide gun buyback program in tandem with other gun violence prevention programming could serve as a key educational tool for communities seeking to reduce the prevalence of firearms. The new program would utilize a graded system with larger rewards for guns most frequently used in crimes (e.g. handguns) and prevent incentivization of gun collectors or arbitrage. It also would incorporate a targeted advertising campaign, focusing on at-risk populations - parents, young people (especially young men) - in partnership with community organizations and credible messengers. Economic Opportunity & Building Generational Wealth Even as Black workers are in danger on the frontlines of our pandemic response, they also face mass unemployment. [100] , [101] But these inequities did not begin with COVID-19. Black New Yorkers have extremely low representation in the best-paying industries, including finance, advertising, and business services, and have long been locked out of opportunities. [102] This underrepresentation unsurprisingly contributes to lower wages for Black New Yorkers, but even within the same industries, the disparities in Black and white earnings are stark. [103] In a similar vein, two percent of New York City’s businesses are owned by Black people, despite them making up 22 percent of the city’s population. [104] And unsurprisingly, because Black New Yorkers have low homeownership rates and far less access to credit than their white neighbors, they suffer displacement from their communities in the wake of neighborhood rezonings. [105] , [104] When it comes to wealth-building, in 2016, Black households with children had one cent for every dollar held by white households with children. [107] Further, household wealth is an indicator of education, employment, and other opportunities throughout our lifespan. For too long, Black people have been shut out and left behind by racist policies and practices across all levels of government. As a result, “it will take 228 years for the average Black family to catch up to the wealth of an average white family today, and that’s only if conditions improve immediately.” [108] Putting cash in the hands of Black New Yorkers will only make a dent in the damage caused, but it’s a good start. The city’s attempts at building economic prosperity for Black New Yorkers has been limited at best, and rife with corruption at worst. New York City’s commitment to contract with more Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) barely makes a dent in our city’s overall contracts, with the New York City Comptroller’s 2020 Agency audit report finding that only 4.9 percent of city contracts were awarded to M/WBEs. [109] Between March and August 2020, the city spent more than $1.5 billion for COVID-19-related goods and services contracts, yet only 11 percent went to M/WBEs. [110] The M/WBE program has long been found to be rife with corruption at both the City and State level - from shell companies set up as “pass-through” entities to secure contracts intended for M/WBEs, to spouses At the same time as Black workers and their families fare the worst or near worst among New Yorkers across so many metrics, we must center their needs in planning our economic recovery. Protect Black Workers Who Have Suffered Through the Pandemic Streamline the city’s workforce development offerings. We must streamline the city’s workforce development offerings to make them easier for small businesses and workers to access and for organized labor to coordinate with, and invest in proven workforce development initiatives for Black communities. Examples include the Jobs-Plus program that serves NYCHA residents, [111] the Customized Training program for Black small businesses, [112] or bridge training to help people prepare for more advanced trainings or education. [113] Reclassify all gig workers by recognizing them as employees rather than contractors. There are an estimated 150,000 [114] app-based independent contractors in New York, representing only 1.6 percent of the state’s overall workforce but about 17.5 percent of over 850,000 low-paid independent contractors in the state. [115] This much broader category of independent contractors labors under similarly low-paid and precarious conditions. As such, we should work with the state to require an hourly minimum wage for industries beyond car sharing, mandate employer-provided paid sick leave, and support gig workers' efforts to unionize. [116] Support Black artists. The arts community has been one of the hardest hit since the COVID-19 pandemic began, as cultural beacons like Broadway shuttered, artists lost gigs, and performances at independent theaters halted across the city. A recent survey by Americans for the Arts found that more than 30,000 artists across the five boroughs were laid off due to the pandemic. [117] As a result, we have a unique opportunity to reshape our city’s connection to the arts and promote Black artists and their stories. We should use discretionary funding to support Black cultural organizations - from nonprofit theaters and dance troupes to museums and art galleries - and incorporate Black art into city efforts where possible, commissioning temporary exhibits from Black artists on city properties or in our parks. We should also work with existing nonprofit cultural institutions to curate and create exhibits about race in New York City that are free to access for all New Yorkers. These exhibits can include oral histories from Black New Yorkers about their experiences with racism, interactive exhibits detailing the effects of redlining or over policing in specific neighborhoods, or a discussion of the Black leaders in our city who have worked to eradicate the injustices and inequities Black New Yorkers have faced for generations. As our city reopens, we should focus our artistic endeavors on Black creators. Building a Robust Black Workforce for a 21st Century City Ensure that Black workers are paid equitably within city government. In October 2020, an analysis required by local law found that male employees roughly average about $4,500 a year more than female employees, and Black city workers average about $7,600 a year less than white workers. New York City must issue an annual report on pay equity disaggregated by multiple variables, including but not limited to race and gender, and ensure that all city jobs make salary information publicly available in real time. [118] Provide widespread education about state pay equity laws. In 2019, New York State passed a state law that bans employers from asking for or relying on salary history to set pay rates, as well as a prohibition on employers’ paying employees less if they perform “substantially similar work” as their colleagues who are not in that protected class. [119] These laws have the potential to protect Black workers but many may not know about them when applying for a job. As such, we must undertake a citywide education campaign about pay equity laws and ensure job seekers know their rights. Expand city investments in supporting the growth of community land trusts and worker cooperatives in Black neighborhoods. We should bolster city funding for community land trusts (CLTs) and worker co-ops in Black neighborhoods. Community land trusts ensure that buildings are not sold for profit, as the trust will own the land but sell property on that land, and stop real estate speculation that can result in resident displacement and even homelessness. [120] As mentioned above, we should create a network of CLTs to buy up derelict buildings and private land with poor living conditions. Worker cooperatives give workers the opportunity to own a portion of their business, increasing wealth for workers and helping reduce economic inequality. [121] Ensure that (re)development plans in Black neighborhoods include ironclad commitments to training and long-term employment in high-quality jobs for incumbent residents. Too many development plans have made vague overtures about employing local talent when the actual jobs guaranteed are few, short-term, and pay too little; and resources are not provided to give local residents the training they need to attain better jobs that new development may create. Developments must include ironclad training and employment commitments for Black communities that ensure they benefit from the arrival of public and private investment in their neighborhoods. Put More Money and Assets in the Hands of Black New Yorkers Put money directly in Black New Yorkers’ hands with a paycheck guarantee. New York City must implement a citywide paycheck guarantee that all Black New Yorkers regardless of immigration status, are eligible for a basic income. Federal legislation to implement a paycheck guarantee, the Paycheck Guarantee Act introduced by Congressmember Pramila Jayapal, would directly cover up 100 percent of workers’ paychecks throughout the coronavirus crisis. [122] The proposal would cover up to $90,000 per worker, and cover every single person working at a business facing a significant revenue loss. A paycheck guarantee would help set Black families up for success in the long-term, while repairing the ills of the past. Create a New York City Baby Bonds program that targets Black families. Our city must implement a baby bond program for all children born into families with household incomes of 0 percent to 30 percent Area Median Income (AMI). Such a program would give these children an investment account at birth that would ultimately grow throughout the child’s life. [123] The child could then use the capital available in the account when they reach adulthood to finance major investments like a college education or costs related to a business start-up. Expand city support for initiatives that promote and protect Black homeownership. Our government should review and formally support initiatives aimed at both expanding and protecting Black homeownership, ranging from estate planning education to organizing tenants to buy multi-family buildings to creating city-backed matched savings accounts to generate money for Black New Yorkers to put toward homeownership in the five boroughs. [124] Expand NYC Kids Rise college savings pilot beyond its initial pilot to more Black neighborhoods. We should expand the pilot of the NYC Kids RISE Save for College program, conducted in partnership with the DOE, to more Black neighborhoods. [125] The program gives every kindergarten student an initial $100 in a state 529 account and gives the child’s parents and guardians information on how to create a college savings plan. Other community members - from religious institutions to community groups - can also contribute to the scholarship accounts. We should formally support this type of community-centered investment in education by expanding the program, specifically targeting Black neighborhoods - including some in District 35. Expand the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection’s Office of Financial Empowerment’s financial literacy and services programming with a focus on Black neighborhoods. We should expand the Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE)’s programs aimed at fighting poverty and connecting New Yorkers with services aimed at bolstering their personal finances, ranging from a starter banking account to free or low-cost tax preparation services. [126] The city should commit to a comprehensive resident education initiative in Black neighborhoods to inform residents about the programs and connect them with any OFE services they may need.

Policy & Legislation Back Policy & Legislation Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC #AgeInPlaceNYC New York City’s population of older adults, which currently represents 20% of our city’s entire population, will only grow as the Baby Boomer generation ages (older adults are our future!). A 2021 CUNY Graduate Center study reports that the population of adults ages 65 and older in New York State will soar 25% between 2021 and 2040, compared to just three percent growth in the general population. In New York City alone, the number of older adults is expected to jump 40% by 2040, especially as New Yorkers are living longer. Simply put, we should have prepared for an aging New York decades ago. We’ve failed time and again, but it's not too late to turn the tide and make New York City a place where every older adult can age in place with dignity. After working with groups like AARP, LiveOn NY, the Asian American Federation, other members of the New York City Council and more to identify key issues facing older adults and brainstorm solutions, Crystal crafted the #AgeInPlaceNYC legislative package. The package includes: Int. 673 (Hudson): Entitle any New Yorker age 60+ facing eviction or termination of tenancy in housing court to full legal representation at no cost and require DFTA to create a housing support program for older adults (PASSED) Int. 674 (Hudson): Require DFTA to create a know your rights pamphlet for older adults (PASSED) Int. 672 (Hudson): Require DFTA to identify the communities served by each older adult center and the prevalent spoken languages of each such community, and to notify each older adult center of such prevalent spoken languages at least once annually (PASSED) Int. 676 (Hudson): Require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop a list of universal design features and require that a developer who receives City financial assistance incorporate universal design in all dwelling units in a new housing development project ( PASSED) Int. 675 (Hudson): Mandate that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) create a telemedicine accessibility plan to improve the availability and accessibility of portable monitoring devices and telehealth devices for populations that could be better served by telemedicine services (PASSED) Int. 665 (Gutiérrez): Require DFTA, in collaboration with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), to create a digital literacy training program for older adults (PASSED) Int. 255 (Hudson): Create a citywide online system for tenants to apply and renew Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) Program and the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE) Program benefits Int. 564 (Cabán): Establish a commission for LGBTQIA+ older adults within DFTA to identify challenges, share best practices, and develop expert recommendations on ways to improve the quality of life of LGBTQIA+ older adults (PASSED) Int. 945 (Hudson): Require Department for the Aging and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to develop a technical support program to serve older adults. Res 236 (Cabán): Support the state in passing legislation to allow New York City to establish an automatic enrollment program for eligible older adults to be automatically enrolled or automatically re-enrolled in the SCRIE program Have a question?

[Commencing one year after the effective date of the local law that added this section,] ACS shall provide to all youth in foster care ages 13 and older an annual survey regarding such youth’s experiences with each foster care placement where the youth resided and with any ACS or foster care agency provider employees the youth came into contact with that year. For youth placed with foster parents, such surveys shall be administered in a location other than the foster parent’s home, or administered online or through a mobile application. ACS shall explain the purpose of such survey to youth and shall not attribute survey responses to youth without their consent. In addition to questions, such survey shall provide space for such youth to provide ACS with any additional information or feedback they wish to share. b.

[ No later than six months following the first administration of the survey, and annually thereafter,] By August 1, 2026, and biennially thereafter, ACS shall submit to the speaker of the council and post on its website aggregated data from the surveys required pursuant to this section and any steps ACS had taken in response to the information provided in such surveys. d.

Young people spent Saturday afternoon marching to make a difference near Washington Park. They are kids who already carry a huge burden after seeing so many of their peers killed. Every picture on a poster they carried is a life lost. Juanita Tennyson knew them all. “They push me. I got to show love, I can’t give up, I can’t be upset, I have to keep going,” said Tennyson. The 23-year-old’s joined forces with Good Kids, Mad City. It’s a student-led advocacy group calling on Mayor Lori Lightfoot to do more than tweet about gun violence. “We want Lori Lightfoot to pay attention and stop giving $1 billion plus to police and start giving to communities that actually need it,” said Miracle Boyd. The students are pressing for an ordinance to reallocate two percent of the Chicago police department’s budget to black and brown communities. “We must defund the police as it hinders us from reaching our full potential as a people,” said Jai Simpson. The money from their “Peace Book” would pay community leaders to work one-on-one with gangs to reduce the violence in high crime areas. “We’re trying to get it passed on the city level and even the state level too so we can like really fund our communities and get people off the streets from cause of harm because you never know when it’s gonna be yours or you,” said Boyd. It has been over seven years since Nathaniel Pendleton’s sister, Hadiya, lost her life. “It’s been a lot of things that I’ve been going through my whole life and I lost like many people,” said Pendleton.

Newsletter  Search STYLE STYLE POLITICS POLITICS CULTURE CULTURE IDENTITY IDENTITY VIDEO VIDEO SUMMIT SUMMIT SHOPPING SHOPPING Newsletter Newsletter Identity The G.L.I.T.S. House Allows Homeless LGBTQ People a Place to Thrive “This is housing for people that want to do the work, that are inspired to do more with their lives and for society.” By Cecilia Nowell December 2, 2020 Getty Images On November 13, Ceyenne Doroshow — a beloved member of the transgender community and founder of the nonprofit Gays and Lesbians Living In a Transgender Society (G.L.I.T.S.) — cut a rainbow-colored ribbon outside a three-story walk-up in Woodhaven, Queens. The moment marked the official opening of the G.L.I.T.S. House, a residential building for the LGBTQ+ community, the first housing complex of its kind to be owned, not rented, by a Black transgender woman in New York City. “I’ve been wanting to open a home like this for over 30 years,” Doroshow tells Teen Vogue . “Since I was homeless before and realizing the problems I had as a young person being [in that situation].” The G.L.I.T.S. House joins a long history of homes created by and for the transgender community — from the S.T.A.R. House that Stonewall revolutionaries Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera opened in the 1970s to modern LGBTQ housing networks. In what has been the deadliest year on record for the transgender and gender non-conforming communities, the G.L.I.T.S. House is not only fighting housing instability, but creating space for future leaders of the LGBTQ+ community to thrive. As a young Black trans teenager, Doroshow lived all over the country. “Florida, New York, New Hampshire — anywhere where I thought I would be safe,” she says. At times, she stayed at shelters, like Covenant House, but was misgendered by administrators who placed her in boys dorms and eventually her asked to leave. “Being in a lot of these spaces, I found a danger,” Doroshow says. “Also, at the time, there was no word for transgender . So I was an oddity in my own community.” In 2015, Doroshow founded G.L.I.T.S. to respond to issues like homelessness, the criminalization of sex work, discrimination, and violence against the LGBTQ community. By then, she’d also become somewhat of a mother in the trans community. “I have a deep love and admiration for who we call dearly Ms. Ceyenne, or Auntie Ceyenne,” says Kei Williams, national organizer at the Marsha P. Johnson Institute and a founding member of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. “She’s very inspiring as a leader and the ways in which she cares about our community is very beautiful and powerful.” In June, during the early days of the nationwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations, Doroshow and her team at G.L.I.T.S. began fundraising to cover a year’s worth of rent for members of the Black trans community. By June 14, when Doroshow spoke to a crowd of 15,000 at the Brooklyn Liberation March for Black trans lives, she announced that G.L.I.T.S. had raised more than $1 million. Those funds ended up being enough that, in July, Doroshow made a down payment on the $2 million G.L.I.T.S. House in Woodhaven. Aside from providing a physical home, Doroshow hopes that the G.L.I.T.S. House will be able to offer educational workshops so its residents have the opportunity to develop new skills. “This is about leadership in the community,” says Doroshow. “This is housing for people that want to do the work, that are inspired to do more with their lives and for society.” The first resident, Doroshow says, will move in in January. In the meantime, Doroshow and her team have been hard at work preparing the building. “It’s beautiful when you walk in,” Doroshow says, and then jokes, “I named an organization ‘G.L.I.T.S.’” On each floor, Doroshow had the light fixtures taken down and replaced with chandeliers. In the main vestibule, her team painted the ceiling gold; in the basement, G.L.I.T.S. transformed the space into a common area decorated with donated artwork. “Historically, Black trans people have always protected and defended our community by sharing everything that we had,” says Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute. “Housing has always been somewhat of the first model, because it’s been the first thing that so many people have been denied.” Perhaps the most well-known example of the trans community creating housing for and by each other was Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera’s S.T.A.R. House . Founded in 1970 by the trans women who had initiated the Stonewall Uprising a year earlier, the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries house was based out of a four-room Mob-owned East Village tenement. “S.T.A.R. was coming from sex workers working to provide for homeless and houseless youth and other sex workers,” says Williams. But it was also “a space for people to have political conversations. It was a space to gather before demonstrations.” In the absence of state resources and in the face of police brutality, Williams says S.T.A.R. members decided to “gather, occupy, and create our own space.” Although the S.T.A.R. House closed only a year later when the girls were unable to make rent, other trans-run homes have followed in its footsteps. In 1995, Rusty Mae Moore and Chelsea Goodwin would open Transy House in Brooklyn, where Sylvia Rivera lived later in her life. Today, Williams and Hearns site the House of Tulip in New Orleans, the House of Rebirth in Dallas, Casa Ruby in Washington, D.C., the Trans Housing Atlanta Program , and Our Trans Home SF in San Francisco as similar initiatives. “I think it’s very beautiful and very powerful that you’re seeing kind of this legacy of S.T.A.R., but also a new rendition of it in so many different places,” says Williams. “And it’s not just in one place like New York City, but you’re seeing down the West Coast, you’re seeing in the South, and you’re seeing Black trans people really decide to take up space and own space.” The S.T.A.R. House “is still a model that so many in our community are utilizing and referencing directly and indirectly as we continue to try to find solutions to interrupt violence against trans women,” says Hearns. “GLITS and so many other community efforts that have been successful during this time are so monumental because they are a reflection of Marsha P. Johnson’s greatest dreams, and her greatest hopes, for her community.” One of the biggest differences between Marsha P. Johnson’s S.T.A.R. House and Ceyenne Doroshow’s G.L.I.T.S. House is that Doroshow owns the property. Where Johnson and her fellow revolutionaries were eventually evicted from their apartment, Williams says that owning property represents a major shift in power. “I think that owning property, historically in America, as we know, is a way to build wealth and to have power,” says Williams. “Owning property is another step in the direction where Black trans people are not asking to be in anybody’s neighborhood, we’re not asking for space — we’re gonna go ahead and buy a property ourselves.” For her part, Doroshow says that the G.L.I.T.S. House is pushing beyond the old survival spaces the transgender community was forced into. “I’m not inspired by the small spaces when we’ve had to live in small spaces our whole lives,” says Doroshow. “What we’re offering is inspiration. And space. And growth. Right across the street is a state park. If there’s anything that speaks to healing, it’s looking at nature, walking out your front door, and having a park be your backyard.” Williams is grateful that Doroshow’s work is being celebrated during her lifetime. “Too often Black trans women aren’t allowed to have their flowers while they’re still living,” he says. “What’s remarkable and beautiful about this is that she’s a living elder, she’s a living Black trans woman who is providing a legacy while she’s still here.” In opening the G.L.I.T.S. House, Doroshow is joining the legacy of “mothers” of the trans community who built homes around chosen family — a concept that Hearns says “really provides a lot of people in our community with a forever home.” “That in itself is bigger than any actual physical house.” Identity The G.L.I.T.S.

Craig Ruttle/AP Photo A new study lays bare the inequalities spurred by city-led rezonings, and points to the dire need for the de Blasio administration to study the racial impacts of land use actions poised to reshape New York City neighborhoods, elected officials and housing advocates said at a Wednesday rally. The “ Zoning & Racialized Displacement in NYC ” report, compiled by Churches United for Fair Housing (CUFHH), used U.S. Census data to analyze two major Bloomberg-era rezonings. The findings revealed that the 2003 Park Slope and 2005 Williamsburg rezonings displaced thousands of black and Latino residents as the neighborhoods’ populations grew. Between 2000 and 2015, Williamsburg and Greenpoint saw a population increase of more than 20,000, but simultaneously saw a decrease of about 15,000 Latino residents, according to the report. In Park Slope, there was a decrease of 5,000 black and Latino households between 2000 and 2013, even as the area’s population grew by more than 6,000 during that same period. “Racialized displacement has followed neighborhood rezonings in New York City,” said Alex Fennell, CUFFH’s network director, during a Wednesday rally on the steps of City Hall. “Colorblind policies that pretend this is not a race issue have gotten us where we are today and it’s well past time not just to stop this, but to reverse it.” Advocates and elected officials are pushing the City Council and the de Blasio administration to support a bill introduced by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams that would mandate the city conduct a racial impact study for land use actions that require an environmental review. Under the bill, draft and final environmental impact statements crafted by the City Planning Commission must include analysis on the “potential direct and indirect racial and ethnic residential impacts of the proposed action” and if the proposal would “affirmatively further fair housing within the meaning” of the federal Fair Housing Act . “Rezonings are one of the primary drivers of gentrification, which leads to displacement,” said Williams. “Rezonings are so sure to pass and so sure to be beneficial to developers that even the announcement of a [review process] leads to rampant speculation that coincides with a rise of harassment and displacement.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s goal to create and preserve 300,000 affordable housing units by 2026 has so far spurred six rezonings in East New York, Downtown Far Rockaway, East Harlem, Jerome Avenue, Inwood, and Staten Island’s Bay Street Corridor. Three others are on the immediate horizon in Brooklyn’s Bushwick and Gowanus neighborhoods, and for a swath of the Bronx’s Southern Boulevard . City Council member Rafael Salamanca, who represents the Southern Boulevard area and holds the influential role of chair to the Council’s land use committee, is a notable backer of Williams’ bill. Salamanca vowed to oppose any potential rezonings in his district without a racial impact study. “I made it very clear to city planning, if you cannot get this racial impact study done, this rezoning on Southern Boulevard is dead on arrival,” said Salamanca. “My recommendation is [for the city to] get your act together and stop wasting people’s time.” Housing advocates and elected officials rallied on the steps of City Hall on Wednesday. Caroline Spivack/Curbed NY North Brooklyn’s Councilmember, Antonio Reynoso, and State Sen., Julia Salazar, along with City Comptroller Scott Stringer, also support Williams’ bill. Under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, 37 percent of the five boroughs was rezoned for both high-density growth and the preservation of low-density neighborhoods. CUFHH’s study says its research indicates that wealthier white populations were downzoned, like with Park Slope’s 2004 rezoning, while other neighborhoods with largely low- to-moderate income minorities were up-zoned with a density boost, as with Williamsburg’s 2005 rezoning. But if Williams’ bill is passed, the racial implications of such undertakings would be clearer and enable more equitable community planning, charge neighborhood advocates. “A mandatory racial impact analysis would promote inclusivity and reduce segregation, prevent litigation and strengthen the community’s voice in city planning,” said Cheryl Pahaham, a Northern Manhattan Is Not Sale member and Inwood Legal Action co-chair whose group is suing the city over the 2018 Inwood rezoning . A racial impact analysis would be an additional step to the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) that assesses the impacts of a proposed project on a neighborhood. That environmental review process has been criticized for often being way off base from its projected impacts. For instance, a 2005 environmental review predicted that Greenpoint and Williamsburg would experience a loss of 1.1 million square feet of manufacturing space, but 2015 data shows that the neighborhood actually lost 5.3 million square feet of manufacturing space, according to CUFHH’s report. A 2003 review projected that Park Slope would not lose a single rent stabilized apartment, according to the study, but by 2013, the neighborhood had lost 1,470 rent regulated units, data shows. To complicate matters, there is no mechanism in the CEQR process that mandates officials re-examine those projections for accuracy once a major land use change has come to fruition. This means that the city is not fact checking its predictions and learning from failed or successful projections, and therefore, its environmental reviews are not being held accountable. Salamaca says he is pushing for the Council’s land use committee to hold a hearing on Williams’ bill in the coming months. Council Speaker Corey Johnson has yet to take a position on the legislation; he is monitoring the bill as it goes through the legislative process, according to a Council spokesperson. The de Blasio administration, despite stalled federal housing policy , has launched its own segregation study that’s expected to land before the end of the year, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. In a statement to Curbed, Mayoral spokesperson Jane Meyers stressed that the de Blasio administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to fighting displacement, and that the results of the study will enable the city to better promote inclusive policies. “This administration is fighting displacement with record levels of affordable housing, free legal services, rent freezes, and programs to combat harassment,” said Meyers. “We are examining the legacy of segregation and deepening our commitment to policies that promote fair housing and inclusive neighborhoods. We look forward to reviewing this legislation and working with our partners to promote equity and fairness.” Next Up In NYC Affordable Housing Budget Cuts Might Doom de Blasio’s Affordable Housing Legacy New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board vote, explained What NYC could do with its $6 billion police budget NYC asks affordable housing developers to house more homeless New Yorkers New York City’s affordable HDFC co-ops, explained New York will offer mortgage relief during coronavirus pandemic.

The School Diversity Advisory Group was charged with coming up with ways to desegregate one of the most segregated school systems in the country. As part of its nearly 70 recommendations, the group proposed eliminating the city’s current, highly segregated method of delivering G&T education. But the recommendation was not a call to stop nurturing or cultivating students’ academic strengths, as some have suggested. Instead, it offers an opportunity to look at how coveted educational programs became so segregated and whether there is a better way to deliver enriched curriculum. Prior to the 2007-2008 school year, community school districts were able to utilize a holistic system for evaluating admissions to neighborhood G&T programs. Generally, admission required a privately-administered IQ test, and could also include teacher recommendations and classroom observations. That year, Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein eliminated the holistic admissions model, replacing it with a single standardized test and a single cutoff score, under the auspices of making the system more objective. In order to gain admission into a district G&T program, children as young as four now had to achieve a score in the nationwide 90th-percentile on the exam. Essentially overnight, there was a catastrophic drop in the number of Black and Latinx children admitted to these programs, from 31 percent Black students in 2007 to 13 percent Black students in 2008. The children who did best on the tests often had access to expensive prep courses and private preschools. We need to move away from a system where children are labeled and sorted into cohorts, and toward one where each student’s individual needs are met New York’s extremely racially-segregated housing patterns multiplied the effects of this change to admissions. In districts where too few children scored high enough, G&T programs were eliminated, so even if children did qualify they would have to travel across neighborhoods or even boroughs in order to enroll. This domino effect meant that some districts in the Bronx and Central Brooklyn, for example, had no G&T programs, reducing parents’ familiarity with them and knowledge of how to apply, even if they would be willing to send their kids to a school across town. And parents’ understandable unwillingness to send their young kids to faraway schools meant that surviving G&T programs became less and less diverse. Fast forward to today, when more than 75 percent of students in G&T programs are white or Asian, and it’s obvious the status quo is unacceptable. Some elected officials have pointed to the shuttering of G&T programs in communities of color and suggested the city should add more programs instead of rethinking G&T altogether. But there is compelling data that any increase in G&T just increases racial isolation. The history, and some would say the purpose, of G&T education in New York City is to segregate students by race and affluence. As long as we maintain the programs, the programs will be segregated. This is not to say we should reduce any student’s access to rigorous, challenging, or enriched curriculum. In fact, there is no G&T curriculum; most students receive merely an accelerated version of the same lessons used in the majority of New York City schools. That curriculum has been criticized for being too narrow, Euro-centric, and test-obsessed. So why not enhance it for everyone? Every kid is more engaged when they see themselves and their culture reflected in school, when they are allowed to be creative, when the work challenges them, and when they are well-supported to meet the challenge. We need to move away from a system where children are labeled and sorted into cohorts, and toward one where each student’s individual needs are met, speed of learning is respected, and talents are cultivated. New York City kids deserve an education system that makes room for enrichment in any area where they excel, without discounting that they may struggle in other subjects, or even have a disability that requires more support. They deserve to learn with and from all their classmates. We don’t have to look far for examples. In 2017, District Eight in the Bronx began offering enriched curriculum to all students, not just those who qualify for a designated G&T program, and demonstrated benefits across their student body. The education professor who designed the curriculum used in D8 said the main tenets were engagement, enthusiasm, and enjoyment. The curriculum helped students learn by getting them excited to be in school. The City should work with the Department of Education to explore ways to provide enriched and advanced curriculum to all students, rather than continuing to label and segregate kids.

No. 256 By Council Members Hudson, Bottcher, Restler, Brewer, Hanif, Abreu, Cabán and Louis A Local Law in relation to requiring the commissioner of sanitation to study the feasibility and potential environmental effects of a recycling mandate for household textiles Be it enacted by the Council as follows: Section 1. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: Commissioner. The term “commissioner” means the commissioner of sanitation. Department. The term “department” means the department of sanitation. Recycling. The term “recycling” means any process by which recyclable materials are separated, collected, processed, marketed, and returned to the economy in the form of raw materials or products. Textile. The term “textile” means cloth, fabric, and other flexible materials made of animal skin, hair, fur, or fleece; plants; minerals; or synthetic materials. b. No later than 1 year after the effective date of this local law, the commissioner shall submit to the council and to the mayor a report on the feasibility and potential environmental effects of a mandate for the source separation by households and the collection by the department of textiles for recycling and reuse and whether the implementation of such mandate would require a municipal textile recycling facility to process collected textiles. Such report shall include, but need not be limited to: 1. An evaluation of market demand for recycled and reused textiles, including whether there is greater demand for certain types of textiles, and potential impacts of recycling mandates on market demand; 2. A comparison of the net cost to the department, at the time of the report, of collecting, processing, recycling, reusing, and disposing of textile waste with the projected net cost of collecting, processing, recycling, reusing, and disposing of textile waste if the recycling mandate is implemented; 3. An evaluation of the potential benefits to the environment resulting from the recycling mandate, including reductions in greenhouse gases and pollution; 4. A discussion of the potential negative effects of the recycling mandate, including the possibility of increased consumption of textiles caused by perceptions that textile recycling has eliminated the negative environmental effects of textile disposal and impacts on non-profits and other private entities that currently collect textiles for recycling; 5. An estimate of what percentage of textiles collected under the recycling mandate would ultimately be recycled, reused, or landfilled, taking into account whether such textiles would likely be transferred to a third party after collection or processing and how such a third party would likely dispose of such textiles, and actions the commissioner could implement to increase the percentage of collected textiles that are recycled or reused; 6. An assessment of whether the recycling mandate would require a municipal recycling facility to process the collected textiles, including the capacity of existing private recycling facilities and the costs of contracting with existing private recycling facilities compared with the costs of establishing and operating a municipal facility; 7. An assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of partnerships with private entities to collect textiles and operate textile recycling facilities; and 8. A discussion of any potential barriers to department collection of textiles and any other information relevant to assessing the feasibility the recycling mandate. § 2.

The American Dream portends that with hard work, a person can own a home, start a business, and grow a nest egg for generations to draw upon. This belief, however, has been defied repeatedly by the United States government’s own decrees that denied wealth-building opportunities to Black Americans. Today, the average white family has roughly 10 times the amount of wealth as the average Black family. White college graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college graduates. Making the American Dream an equitable reality demands the same U.S. government that denied wealth to Blacks restore that deferred wealth through reparations to their descendants in the form of individual cash payments in the amount that will close the Black-white racial wealth divide. Additionally, reparations should come in the form of wealth-building opportunities that address racial disparities in education, housing, and business ownership. In 1860, over $3 billion was the value assigned to the physical bodies of enslaved Black Americans to be used as free labor and production. This was more money than was invested in factories and railroads combined. In 1861, the value placed on cotton produced by enslaved Blacks was $250 million. Slavery enriched white slave owners and their descendants, and it fueled the country’s economy while suppressing wealth building for the enslaved. The United States has yet to compensate descendants of enslaved Black Americans for their labor. Nor has the federal government atoned for the lost equity from anti-Black housing, transportation, and business policy. Slavery, Jim Crow segregation, anti-Black practices like redlining, and other discriminatory public policies in criminal justice and education have robbed Black Americans of the opportunities to build wealth (defined as assets minus debt) afforded to their white peers. Bootstrapping isn’t going to erase racial wealth divides. As economists William “Sandy” Darity and Darrick Hamilton point out in their 2018 report , What We Get Wrong About Closing the Wealth Gap , “Blacks cannot close the racial wealth gap by changing their individual behavior –i.e. by assuming more ‘personal responsibility’ or acquiring the portfolio management insights associated with ‘[financial] literacy.’” In fact, white high school dropouts have more wealth than Black college graduates . Moreover, the racial wealth gap did not result from a lack of labor. Rather, it came from a lack of financial capital. Not only do racial wealth disparities reveal fallacies in the American Dream, the financial and social consequences are significant and wide-ranging. Wealth is positively correlated with better health, educational, and economic outcomes. Furthermore, assets from homes, stocks, bonds, and retirement savings provide a financial safety net for the inevitable shocks to the economy and personal finances that happen throughout a person’s lifespan. Recessions impact everyone, but wealth is distributed quite unevenly in the U.S. The woeful inadequacy of a government-sponsored safety net was made apparent in the wake of economic disasters like the 2008 housing crisis and natural ones like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Those who can draw upon the equity in a home, savings, and securities are able to recover faster after economic downturns than those without wealth. The lack of a social safety net and the racial wealth divide are currently on display amid the COVID-19 crisis. Disparities in access to health care along with inequities in economic policies combine to make Black people more vulnerable to negative consequences than white individuals. Below, we provide a history of reparations in the United States, missed opportunities to redress the racial wealth gap, and specific details of a viable reparations package for Black Americans. History of reparations in the United States Reparations—a system of redress for egregious injustices—are not foreign to the United States. Native Americans have received land and billions of dollars for various benefits and programs for being forcibly exiled from their native lands. For Japanese Americans, $1.5 billion was paid to those who were interned during World War II . Additionally, the United States, via the Marshall Plan , helped to ensure that Jews received reparations for the Holocaust, including making various investments over time. In 1952, West Germany agreed to pay 3.45 billion Deutsche Marks to Holocaust survivors. Black Americans are the only group that has not received reparations for state-sanctioned racial discrimination, while slavery afforded some white families the ability to accrue tremendous wealth. And, we must note that American slavery was particularly brutal. About 15 percent of the enslaved shipped from Western Africa died during transport. The enslaved were regularly beaten and lynched for frivolous infractions. Slavery also disrupted families as one in three marriages were split up and one in five children were separated from their parents. The case for reparations can be made on economic, social, and moral grounds. The United States had multiple opportunities to atone for slavery—each a missed chance to make the American Dream a reality—but has yet to undertake significant action. Missed policy opportunities to atone for slavery with reparations 40 Acres and a Mule The first major opportunity that the United States had and where it should have atoned for slavery was right after the Civil War. Union leaders including General William Sherman concluded that each Black family should receive 40 acres. Sherman signed Field Order 15 and allocated 400,000 acres of confiscated Confederate land to Black families. Additionally, some families were to receive mules left over from the war, hence 40 acres and a mule . Yet, after President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson reversed Field Order 15 and returned land back to former slave owners. Instead of giving Blacks the means to support themselves, the federal government empowered former enslavers. For example, in Washington D.C., slave owners were actually paid reparations for lost property —the formally enslaved. This practice was also common in nearby states. Many Black Americans with limited work options returned as sharecroppers to till the same land for the very slave owners to whom they were once enslaved. Slave owners not only made money off the chattel enslavement of Black Americans, but they then made money multiple times over off the land that the formerly enslaved had no choice but to work. The New Deal There’s never a bad time to do what’s morally right, but the United States has had prime opportunities to atone for slavery. In the 1930s, the United States was reeling from the 1929 stock market crash and was firmly engulfed in the Great Depression. The Franklin Roosevelt administration implemented a series of policies as part of his New Deal legislation, estimated to cost roughly $50 billion then, to catapult the country out of depression. Current estimates price the New Deal at about $50 trillion. Two particular policies of the New Deal fell short in redressing American’s racial wrongs—the G.I. Bill and Social Security. Though white and Black Americans fought in WWII, Black veterans could not redeem their post-war benefits like their white peers. While the G.I. Bill was mandated federally, it was implemented locally. The presence of racial housing covenants and redlining among local municipalities prohibited Blacks from utilizing federal benefits. White soldiers were afforded the opportunity to build wealth by sending themselves and their children to college and by obtaining housing and small business grants. Regarding Social Security, two key professions that would have improved equity in America were excluded from the legislation—domestic and farm workers. These omissions effectively excluded 60 percent of Blacks across the U.S. and 75 percent in southern states who worked in these occupations. Roosevelt bargained these exclusionary provisions in the legislation on the backs of Black veterans and workers in order to propel mostly white America out of the Great Depression. There are other policies and practices that contributed to racial wealth gap. Government-sanctioned discrimination related to the 1862 Homestead Act, redlining, restrictive covenants, and convict leasing blocked Blacks from the ability to gain wealth at similar rates as whites. Separate from slavery, damages should be awarded to Black people who were harmed by these policies and practices. Reparations for slavery and anti-Black policies We know the monetary value that was placed on enslaved Blacks and the productivity of their labor, as well as the amount of the racial wealth gap. We’ve seen other groups receive restitutions while the federal government pulled back reparations for Black Americans. Accordingly, if we want to close the racial wealth gap and live up to our moral creed to protect “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” a federal reparations package for Black Americans is in order. This package should include individual and collective public benefits that simultaneously builds wealth and eliminates debt among Black citizens. We assert that it should be similar to the Harriet Tubman Community Investment Act, which was recently heard before the Maryland General Assembly where Ray testified on its behalf . The Harriet Tubman Community Investment Act aims to atone for slavery and its legacy by addressing education, homeownership, and business ownership barriers. Individual payments for descendants of enslaved Black Americans The U.S. government owes lost wages as well as damages to the people it helped enslave. In addition to the lost wages, the accumulative amount of restitution for individuals should eliminate the racial wealth gap that currently exists. According to the Federal Reserve’s most recent numbers in 2016, based on the Survey of Consumer Finances, white families had the highest median family wealth at $171,000, compared to Black and Hispanic families, which had $17,600 and $20,700, respectively. College tuition to 4-year or 2-year colleges and universities for descendants of enslaved Black Americans People should be able to use the tuition remission to obtain a bachelor’s degree or an associate’s/vocational or technical degree. Tuition should be available for public or private universities. Considering the racial gap in the ability to obtain degrees at private schools, this part of the package will further help to reduce racial disparities by affording more social network access and opportunity structures. Student loan forgiveness for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Student loan debt continues to be a significant barrier to wealth creation for Black college graduates. Among 25-55 year olds, about 40 percent of Blacks compared to 30 percent of whites have student loan debt . Blacks also have nearly $45,000 of student loan debt compared to about $30,000 for whites. Recent research finds that Blacks are more likely to be allocated unsubsidized loans. Furthermore, graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, compared to Predominately White Institutions, are more likely to receive subprime loans with higher interest rates. Universities including Georgetown and Princeton Theological Seminary, which is the second-oldest seminary in the country, are aiming to atone for the fact that the sale of slaves helped to fortify their university endowments and establish them as elite institutions of higher education on a global scale. Descendants of the slaves sold by Georgetown and Princeton Theological Seminary are now entitled to full rights and benefits bestowed by those universities to obtain degrees across the higher education pipeline. The Virginia state legislature voted for some of its state universities to atone for slavery with reparations. Other universities, along with state legislatures and the federal government, should follow suit. Georgetown Princeton Other universities, along with state legislatures and the federal government, should follow suit. Down payment grants and housing revitalization grants for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Down payment grants will provide Black Americans with some initial equity in their homes relative to mortgage insurance loans. Housing revitalization grants will help Black Americans to refurbish existing homes in neighborhoods that have been neglected due to a lack of government and corporate investments in predominately Black communities. Given recent settlements for predatory lending , low and fixed interest rates as well as property tax caps in areas in which housing prices are significantly devalued should be part of the package. After accounting for factors such as housing quality, neighborhood quality, education, and crime, owner-occupied homes in Black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 per home on average, amounting to a whopping $156 billion that homeowners would have received if their homes were priced at market rates, according to Brookings research . As gentrification occurs, Blacks are typically priced out of neighborhoods they helped to maintain, while the historical and current remnants of redlining and restrictive covenants inhibited investments. Some Black Americans are being forced from their family home of decades because of tax increases as neighborhoods are gentrified. This is an important point because some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates aimed to redress the racial wealth gap by focusing on historically redlined districts. Perry’s research shows that these policies fall short of capturing a large segment of Black Americans. Business grants for business starting up, business expansion to hire more employees, or purchasing property for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Black-owned businesses are more likely to be located in predominately Black neighborhoods that need the infrastructure and businesses. However, Black business owners are still less likely to obtain capital from banks to make their businesses successful. This reparations package for Black Americans is about restoring the wealth that has been extracted from Black people and communities. Still, reparations are all for naught without enforcement of anti-discrimination policies that remove barriers to economic mobility and wealth building. The architecture of the economy must change in order to create an equitable society. The racial wealth gap was created by racist policies. Federal intervention is needed to remove the racism that undergirds those polices. In some respects, the question of who should receive reparations is more controversial than what or how much people should be awarded. Who should receive reparations? One key question after deciding what a reparations package should include is who should qualify. In short, a Black person who can trace their heritage to people enslaved in U.S. states and territories should be eligible for financial compensation for slavery. Meanwhile, Black people who can show how they were excluded from various policies after emancipation should seek separate damages. For instance, a person like Senator Cory Booker whose parents are descendants of slaves would qualify for slavery reparations whereas Senator Kamala Harris (Jamaican immigrant father and Indian immigrant mother) and President Barack Obama (Kenyan immigrant father and white mother) may seek redress for housing and/or education segregation. Sasha and Malia Obama (whose mother is Michelle Robinson Obama, a descendant of enslaved Africans) would qualify. To determine qualification, birth records can initially be used to determine if a person was classified as Black American. Economist Sandy Darity asserts that people should show a consistent pattern of identification . Census records can then be used to determine if a person has consistently identified as Black American. Finally, DNA testing can be used as a supplement to determine lineage. This is how Senator Booker, who first introduced a reparations bill in the Senate, learned that his lineage stemmed from Sierra Leone. Conclusion For the descendants of the 12.5 million Blacks who were shipped in chains from Western Africa, “America has a genetic birth defect when it comes to the question of race,” as stated recently by U.S. Representative Hakeem Jeffries. If America is to atone for this defect, reparations for Black Americans is part of the healing and reconciliation process. With April 4 marking the fifty-second year since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, we think it is appropriate to end with an oft-forgotten quote from Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” that he gave in 1963 in Washington, D.C. This statement is still one of the unfulfilled aspects of this policy-related speech: We have come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. … It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.” But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. Given the lingering legacy of slavery on the racial wealth gap, the monetary value we know that was placed on enslaved Blacks, the fact that other groups have received reparations, and the fact that Blacks were originally awarded reparations only to have them rescinded provide overwhelming evidence that it is time to pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved Blacks.

Jones's Columns Press Release Testimony COVID-19 Resources Criminalizing Poverty Housing the Unheard Third The Equity Agenda 2021 Unheard Third Survey 2022 Unheard Third Survey Race and the Economic Fallout from COVID-19 in New York City Irene Lew July 30th, 2020 New York City, once the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the US, continues to see a steady decline in new COVID-19 cases, related hospitalizations and deaths. Meanwhile COVID-19 infections have spiked in two dozen states, including Texas, Florida and Arizona, all of which reported record numbers of new COVID-19 cases in July. But nearly five months after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, New York City is faring much worse economically than the rest of the country. Between mid-March and mid-July, more than 1.5 million people in New York City filed for unemployment , a staggering number that exceeds the cumulative number of initial claims filed in most states over the same period. In June, the national unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent but New York City’s rate rose to 20.4 percent. In the Bronx, which has been hit hard by COVID-19, nearly a quarter of residents were out of work in June , the highest unemployment rate of the five boroughs. Communities of color in the Bronx and elsewhere in New York City have disproportionately shouldered the burden of the economic and public health fallout from COVID-19. Although Black and Latinx New Yorkers make up 51 percent [1] of the population in New York City, they account for two-thirds of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City and are twice as likely as white New Yorkers to die from COVID-19. Joblessness remains more widespread among communities of color in New York than among people of color nationwide. As of June 2020, citywide unemployment rates are now 21.1 percent among Asian residents, 23.7 percent among Black residents and 22.7 percent among Latinx residents, compared to just 13.9 percent among white New Yorkers. [2] Meanwhile, national unemployment rates for workers of color were seven to eight percentage points lower than among New Yorkers of color: 13.8 percent of Asian workers, 14.5 percent of Latinx workers, and 15.4 percent of Black workers nationwide were unemployed in June. [3] Data collected between mid-June to early July by the Census Bureau for its weekly Household Pulse Survey provide a more detailed, up-to-date snapshot of the disparate economic impact of the coronavirus on communities of color in New York City. [4] As Congress considers a new relief package, it should extend Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), the supplementary $600 in federal unemployment benefits that have already expired in New York State and are set to expire nationwide at the end of this week. In New York City, the end of the extra $600 a week will fall hardest on families of color, who have experienced job loss and hardship at higher rates than white households since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. New Yorkers of color more were more likely to lose employment income since the start of the pandemic. New Yorkers were more likely than adults nationwide to live in a household that lost employment income since the start of the pandemic, reflecting the far more severe coronavirus outbreak and the slower economic reopening. But the pain has not been felt equally. Compared to 51 percent of white adults, 56 percent of Black, 58 percent of Asian and 66 percent of Latinx adults in the New York City metro area lived in a household that experienced a loss in employment income since mid-March, when mandatory shutdowns led to widespread business closures in the region. Figure 1 Asian and Latinx New Yorkers were hit hardest by COVID-related layoffs, reduction in business and widespread business closures. Pre-pandemic, Latinx and Asian New Yorkers, the majority of them immigrants, were more likely than white New Yorkers to be working in low-wage sectors like personal care, accommodation and food service, [5] precisely the industries hit hardest by widespread COVID-19-related business shutdowns and drastically reduced business volume. While the city has gradually loosened restrictions over the past two months, allowing restaurants to proceed with outdoor dining and for personal care businesses like nail and beauty salons to re-open, many restaurants and other non-essential businesses closed during the pandemic will remain shuttered . Between mid-June and early July, 49 percent of Asian and 41 percent of Latinx adults in the New York City metro area reported that their main reason for not working in the past week was due to a layoff, an employer reduction in business, or their employer closing temporarily or permanently due to the coronavirus, compared to 35 percent of white adults and a third of Black adults who listed these reasons. Latinx workers were most likely to report being sick with COVID or being concerned about their risk for infection as their main reason for being out of work Between mid-June and early July, Latinx New Yorkers were three times more likely than white New Yorkers to report that their main reasons for not working in the past week were due to previously being sick with COVID-19, currently being sick with COVID-19, or being concerned with  contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to others (see Figure 2). Many Latinx New Yorkers have continued to work onsite for essential businesses throughout the pandemic, making deliveries, cleaning buildings and re-stocking shelves at grocery stores. Since they have frequent interaction with customers and don’t have the luxury of social distancing, they have continued to face the greatest risk for contracting the coronavirus, often working without additional compensation or an adequate supply of personal protective equipment. Overall, 61 percent of Latinx New Yorkers were out of work in the past week due to COVID-19-related reasons, compared to just 39 percent of white New Yorkers. Figure 2 Financial insecurity was more prevalent among Black and Latinx New Yorkers even before the pandemic hit Pre-pandemic, Black and Latinx New Yorkers had a much smaller financial buffer than their white counterparts to cushion the blow of job loss, reduced income or unexpected expenses. [6] According to CSS’s 2019 Unheard Third survey, 40 percent of Black New Yorkers and 39 percent of Latinx New Yorkers have zero or less than $500 in emergency savings, compared to only 16 percent of white residents. A third of Black New Yorkers and 45 percent of Latinx New Yorkers said that they worried all or most of the time about having enough income to pay their bills, in contrast to just 17 percent of white New Yorkers who felt this way. [7] (These numbers may not add to the amounts shown in the charts below due to rounding.) Figure 3 and Figure 4 Compared to people of color nationwide, New Yorkers of color are more likely to turn to unemployment benefits to meet their spending needs With little to nothing in savings set aside before the pandemic, New Yorkers of color were ill-prepared to weather the wave of job loss triggered by the mandatory shutdown of non-essential businesses in mid-March. In the absence of savings, unemployment benefits have been an important safety net for many New Yorkers, especially those of color. In New York City, a higher proportion of those who lost employment income in their household were able to draw on unemployment benefits to meet critical spending needs. A third of Latinx New Yorkers turned to unemployment benefits to pay for necessities in the past week, in contrast to less than a quarter of Latinx nationwide. Unemployment benefits have been particularly helpful for Asian New Yorkers in paying for necessary expenses—52 percent reported using these benefits in the past seven days, compared to 34 percent of Asians nationwide. A recent Century Foundation analysis found that Asian Americans have utilized unemployment insurance benefits at high levels in New York and other states like California and Washington that were impacted by the earliest COVID-19 outbreaks. Figure 5 Without FPUC, many New Yorkers of color will lose an important lifeline that is helping them pay the rent and meet other necessary expenses. While detailed data on the racial breakdown of those receiving enhanced federal unemployment benefits is unavailable, the Congressional Budget Office found that, nationwide, 42 percent of those reliant on FPUC in June were non-white. Food insecurity is more prevalent among Black and Latinx New Yorkers Prior to the pandemic, data from CSS’s 2019 Unheard Third survey showed that food insecurity was more widespread among Black and Latinx New Yorkers: 36 percent of Black and 45 percent of Latinx New Yorkers experienced a food-related hardship [8] in the past year, more than double the share of white New Yorkers who did. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were also three times more likely than white residents to rely on SNAP benefits to afford food: just 8 percent of white New Yorkers we surveyed in 2019 said that they received SNAP benefits, compared to 27 percent of Black New Yorkers, and a similar share (29 percent) of Latinx New Yorkers. Overwhelmed by demand, food pantries and soup kitchens are struggling to meet the need of hungry New Yorkers during the pandemic, especially in hard-hit communities of color. Despite an unprecedented expansion of public and private food assistance programs in the city, people of color are more likely than white people to struggle with food insecurity: between mid-June and early July, 18 percent of Black adults and 19 percent of Latinx adults living in the New York City metro area said that their household sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the last seven days, while just 6 percent of white adults said their household lacked sufficient food.  Latinx adults were also five times more likely than white adults to rely on free groceries or a free meal in the last week. Figure 6 Asian, Black and Latinx tenants were three times more likely to report falling behind on their rent As we highlighted in a recent post on race and evictions in New York City, Black and Latinx renters are at higher risk than white tenants for losing their housing when New York State’s moratorium on evictions expires on August 20. In the New York City metro area, people of color have disproportionately suffered from COVID-19 related business closures and job loss, which is now threatening their housing stability. As of early July, Asian, Black and Latinx tenants were three to four times more likely than white tenants to report that they had fallen behind on their rent or deferred payment. Asian, Black and Latinx tenants were also two to three times as likely as white tenants to have little to no confidence that they could pay next month’s rent on time. Latinx tenants faced the highest rates of housing instability: more than a third are behind on their rent and nearly half had little to no confidence in their ability to make next month’s rent on time.  Compared to renters nationwide, Asian and Latinx tenants in the New York City metro area are at much greater risk for losing their housing. As of early July, only 14 percent of Asian tenants nationwide said that they fell behind on their rent or deferred payment, but the share more than doubles among Asian tenants in New York City. (These numbers may not add to the amounts shown in the charts below due to rounding.) Figure 7 Figure 8 Recommendations In the New York City metro area, people of color were hit harder by the economic fallout of COVID-19 than white residents. However, the Census Household Pulse survey data revealed noticeable differences in economic impacts within communities of color. Food insecurity was most prevalent among Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Asians and Latinx New Yorkers were much more likely than Black New Yorkers to be out of work due to concerns about contracting the coronavirus or COVID-19-related business closures, layoffs and reduced business volume. Since Asian New Yorkers were hit hard by reduced business and business shutdowns, they were most likely to draw on unemployment benefits to help meet their spending needs. Housing insecurity is highest among Latinx New Yorkers, who have been disproportionately impacted by income and job loss since the start of this pandemic. The next Congressional coronavirus relief package should include an extension of FPUC and other critical expansions in unemployment benefits that have helped more than a million New York City residents keep food on the table, pay their rent and meet other needs. In addition to FPUC, the CARES Act created two other unemployment benefit programs that are set to expire at the end of this year: the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program (PUA), which expanded the pool of workers eligible for unemployment benefits to include those who are gig workers or self-employed, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which provides up to 13 weeks of additional jobless benefits to those who have exhausted their regular state unemployment insurance benefits. These expansions have helped low-wage workers who often do not qualify for regular state unemployment benefits or those who typically receive low benefit levels even when they do qualify. To improve food security, the next relief package should also include an increase in SNAP benefits for all participants. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act signed into law by President Trump in April had included a 40 percent increase in monthly SNAP benefits, but had left out the poorest households . The extensions of these federal relief measures should be paired with state and local programs to provide direct financial assistance to workers who have been excluded from unemployment benefits and other government relief programs because of their immigration status. New York City and a number of other states and municipalities have created emergency relief funds to support undocumented workers impacted by the pandemic. New York state should consider creating a larger-scale, longer-term state-funded unemployment or wage replacement program to provide weekly payments to undocumented workers who don’t qualify for state unemployment benefits. To address increased housing insecurity and eviction risk among tenants of color, the state should pass Zellnor Myrie’s Emergency Housing Stability and Tenant Displacement Prevention Act , which would halt residential and commercial eviction and foreclosure proceedings for a year after the state’s emergency declaration is lifted. The state should also pass Brian Kavanaugh’s proposed Housing Access Voucher Program , which would provide emergency rental assistance to individuals and families in homeless shelters and those at risk for becoming homeless due to COVID-19-related loss of income. On the local level, the city should prioritize an immediate expansion of Right to Counsel citywide to provide all low-income tenants facing an eviction in housing court with the right to an attorney. Longer term, the city should expand Right to Counsel to moderate-income tenants as well. Footnotes 1. CSS analysis of 2018 American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau. 2.

The state should also pass Brian Kavanaugh’s proposed Housing Access Voucher Program , which would provide emergency rental assistance to individuals and families in homeless shelters and those at risk for becoming homeless due to COVID-19-related loss of income. On the local level, the city should prioritize an immediate expansion of Right to Counsel citywide to provide all low-income tenants facing an eviction in housing court with the right to an attorney. Longer term, the city should expand Right to Counsel to moderate-income tenants as well.  Footnotes 1. CSS analysis of 2018 American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau. 2. CSS analysis of Current Population Survey (CPS) June 2020 data, accessed from IPUMS. Among New York City civilian population in the labor force aged 16 and older. Since the New York City sample in the CPS data is relatively small, the monthly unemployment rates by race and ethnicity have high margins of error associated with them, occasionally causing large fluctuations in monthly rates. 3.

New York City refers to the New York City metropolitan area, which also includes parts of Long Island, Lower Hudson Valley, Northern and Central New Jersey, and one county in northeastern Pennsylvania. Unless noted, the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse survey data cited in this piece is based on a pooled four-week sample from weeks 7 through 10 (June 11 to July 7, 2020). Due to the small sample size for the New York City metro area, data was pooled over four weeks to get a larger sample for analysis. 5. In 2018, 12 percent of Asian adult New Yorkers and the same share of Latinx adult New Yorkers worked in accommodation and food service, triple the share of white New Yorkers (4 percent). Latinx residents made up 42 percent of New Yorkers employed in accommodation and food service, and 37 percent of those in personal care industries. Based on a CSS analysis of 2014-18 Five-Year American Community Survey data. 6. The Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households published by the Federal Reserve describes the difficulties experienced in dealing with a $400 unforeseen emergency by 37 percent of households nationwide. 7. The Unheard Third is a scientific telephone survey designed by Community Service Society in collaboration with Lake Research Partners who administer it using Random Digit Dialing and professional interviewers. In 2019, 1,829 New York City residents were reached by cell phones and landlines from June 18 to July 20. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish and Chinese. The margin of error for the entire survey is +/- 2.29 percentage points and +/- 2.97 percentage points for the low-income component. 8. Food-related hardships include going hungry, skipping meals, receiving free meals from family or friends or receiving food from a pantry or soup kitchen.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations When COVID-19 spread throughout NYC earlier this year, communities of color across the board suffered the most . City data shows Hispanic/Latino and Black people died at about twice the rate of white people. Though Asians and Pacific-Islanders appeared to have the lowest death rates, a study disaggregating data about Asian American COVID-19 patients found Chinese New Yorkers had a mortality rate of 35.7%, higher than all Asian Americans, 25.5%, and Black New Yorkers, 23.7%. The city notes data for non-hospitalized coronavirus cases is limited, and the health inequities are the accumulation of centuries of structural racism. “It did peel back the onion ... on health disparities that we’ve been talking about,” said civil rights activist and president of the NAACP’s New York State Conference, Hazel Dukes. Now, with the vaccine phase of the pandemic underway, health leaders, racial justice advocates, and government officials are looking ahead to try to preempt racial disparities in the vaccine rollout once it expands to future phases. High rates of hesitancy among people of color—the highest among Black New Yorkers—are drawing particular concern. “I must say, all hands are on deck,” Dukes said. “The more education that we do and get it out, not as fake news but with scientists...it’s going to make a world of difference to our community.” Dukes is on an equity task force convened by Governor Andrew Cuomo and another with Black community leaders who joined forces to start figuring out how to make sure information about the vaccine is reaching underserved communities. Pandemic-era restrictions have forced some of those efforts online. “Most of our institutions are closed, like our churches, where most of our seniors get their information from,” Dukes said. “We're going to have to work with our ministers who are doing Zoom and [streaming] their services.” A virtual forum held by Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer Monday night hosted doctors and public health experts who spoke about how the vaccine trials worked and other virus concerns, Dukes noted. “Some people are upset,” Dukes said. They ask her, “‘Why did we do this so fast?’” Though recent nationwide polling shows vaccine hesitancy has waned across racial groups in recent months, a November Siena poll of voters across New York state showed just 62%—about six in 10—Black New Yorkers said they would definitely or likely get the vaccine, followed by 65% of Latinos and 72% of white people. City health officials have said an October survey showed all non-white people, including Asians, are less willing to get a vaccine than white people. A city ad campaign on social media, news media, and subway stations is ramping up in 16 languages to reach a range of racial and ethnic groups, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday. Public housing complexes will host free vaccine sites, like they did for test sites. “How can we move the needle? It's really empowering individuals to take better control of their health overall,” said Dr. Torian Easterling, the chief equity officer at the NYC Health Department. He's working to make scientific information about the vaccine digestible and getting questions about it answered. Virtual informational town halls will target 27 neighborhoods and a training model would be distributed to “trusted messengers” to host their own information sessions. “The fear, the distrust is real,” said Jennifer Jones Austin, a member of the independently formed task force with Dukes and the CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. Some health experts and advocates point to the challenges arising from medical abuses in American history. The Tuskegee trials , in which treatment was withheld from Black men with syphilis under the guise of research, eroded trust and resulted in long-lasting public health impacts . Another example includes U.S. government-led experiments in Latin America, and one expert previously told us she worries that the fear of continued historic patterns could reinforce vaccine hesitancy . Racial disparities persist today. Indigenous, Hispanic, and Black women are more likely to be mistreated during childbirth . Latino/Hispanic and Black men have 3.4 and 5 times the rate, respectively, of new HIV diagnoses compared to white men in NYC, data released this month shows . And a Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted last summer found 22% of Black adults and 18% of Hispanic adults had an instance in the past three years in which they did not believe a doctor or healthcare provider was telling the truth. The rate was 17% for white adults. Immigration rules called “public charge” under the Trump administration have prompted some undocumented immigrants to avoid healthcare , which is seeping into vaccine programs . NYC’s public hospitals have encouraged people to seek care regardless of their status with guidance on the rules. “We want to make sure that individuals who have reason to fear government, and reason to fear medicine, do not take themselves out of the vaccine game without having the knowledge to make an informed decision," Jones Austin said. To expand access to the vaccine itself, state health officials will distribute vaccine kits with supplies to set up a distribution site—with items from room dividers and chairs to PPE and syringes. “We’ll have these [kits] ready to then work with community groups, churches, housing authorities, so we can just send it to those places,” Cuomo said during a press conference Monday. “It’s a foot race between increasing vaccines and slowing the spread.” The undertaking is reminiscent of just months ago when coronavirus testing was once difficult to obtain. In early March, the governor set a benchmark of 1,000 tests a day . Now, the state conducts more than 200,000 tests everyday. The SOMOS Network has been testing for COVID-19 at community health sites across the city and more recently helping the city education department test students . SOMOS chairman Dr. Ramon Tallaj wants the group of 2,000+ doctors to help with vaccinations too. “The trust is not there because they don’t want anybody else but their community doctor to do so,” Tallaj said. “We are culturally and linguistically competent. We speak the languages. We are in the neighborhood.” Tallaj wants to obtain four ultra-cold fridges to store Pfizer vaccines at negative 94 degrees Fahreinheit, so the two-shot vaccine can be brought to places besides major hospitals or nursing homes. “They must integrate the primary care, the community doctors to do the vaccination for the community at-large.” Tagged COVID-19 COVID-19 coronavirus coronavirus racism racism  Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations MORE news New Jersey school officials say the feds haven't explained what's illegal about DEI in the first place.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.

Police issued 440 tickets for biking on the sidewalk in 2018 and 2019, and 374 of those where race was listed — or 86.4 percent — went to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers, according to the city’s own data crunched by Streetsblog. The number of tickets issued to Black and Hispanic bikers is wildly disproportionate, given that they comprise only 49 percent of cyclists, according to the Department of Transportation. During the same 24 months, police issued white cyclists just 39 tickets for riding on the sidewalk — only 9 percent of the total number of tickets where race was indicated. The DOT says white cyclists comprise 40 percent of all bikers in the city. The specific breakdown between Jan. 1, 2018 and Dec. 31, 2019, was: Black people got 230 tickets, 0r 53 percent of the biking on the sidewalk tickets where race was listed. People listed by cops as Hispanic got 144 tickets, or 33 percent. People listed by cops as Asian or Pacific Islander got 16 tickets, or 3.6 percent. Black men made up the largest chunk of all summonses issued, receiving 223 — or 51 percent — of the 433 tickets where race was listed. It's yet another example of discriminatory policing against people of color in public space that puts Black men in more danger than it does create safe bike routes, said Transportation Alternatives spokesman Joe Cutrufo. bike on sidewalk summons Powered by Socrata And of the 374 tickets that went to Black and Latino bikers, 179 — or 47.8 percent — went to people 24-years-old or younger, according to the data. "If people are riding bikes on the sidewalk, it's because there's no safe place to ride in the street. Handing out tickets doesn't build protected bike lanes," said Cutrufo. "Our resources would be so much better spent on designing and building safe streets, not harassing Black men for trying to get from A to B safely." White women received just three tickets out of the total 440, according to the data (there are just seven summonses for which police did not list race). The stats follow a 2014 Streetsblog report, which revealed that of the 15 neighborhoods where police handed out the most summonses for cycling on the sidewalk, 12 were mostly Black or Latino. And they come after Transportation Alternatives issued a new report calling on the de Blasio administration to remove the NYPD from its disproportionately large oversight of traffic enforcement in the city to make streets safer from crashes, but also protect people of color from the cops themselves. The report argues that protected bike lanes not only reduce crashes, but also reduce the need for police involvement, by facilitating as much as a 94-percent drop in cycling on the sidewalk. But the disproportionation number of summonses issued to people of color for biking on the sidewalk is still even slightly less than the percentage of tickets given to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers for jaywalking — Streetsblog reported last month that cops issued 99 percent of jaywalking tickets to Black and Hispanic people in the first quarter of this year, following similar numbers in 2019. And in addition to cyclists of color being at greater risk for physical violence by police during such stops, disproportionately ticketing Black and Latino riders for low-level non-violent offenses poses a financial burden on those communities. "The NYPD always criminalizes Black people at higher rates for just about every thing imaginable. For low level community issues, Black and Latinx people are targeted, ticketed, arrested and put through the system at unconscionable disproportionate rates," said Anne Oredeko, supervising attorney of the Racial Justice Unit at The Legal Aid Society. "All of these actions have a real financial toll on the individual and when done on the scale that the NYPD does it, it literally steals wealth out of Black and Latinx communities. The financial cost of the NYPD's racist criminal enforcement in communities of color reinforces the structural oppression, racism, and economic injustice that poor Black and Latinx people face everyday." Oredeko went on to demand change — not just through reforms, but by defunding the NYPD and reallocating that money into communities of color. "No matter the reform measures implemented that has not changed," she added. "The NYPD needs to be defunded and poor Black communities and other communities of color need those financial resources to be pumped back into them. Especially since through racially discriminatory enforcement like this, for decades, the NYPD has continued to steal financial resources from Black and Latinx communities." The stats are not shocking to Black bikers who experience the targeted enforcement first hand, and not just as one number in a data set. Last year, five cyclists of color shared their stories of police harassment with Streetsblog, and this year, hundreds of cyclists are taking to the streets in protest against police brutality — rides that also showcase the most basic levels of racism in the form of infrastructure neglect in lower-income communities of color. “Our last ride we went through Bushwick and certain parts of Ridgewood and every block it was like, ‘Everybody ride slow’ because there were excessive potholes and glass in the street. Once we got to Dumbo it was just smooth sailing. We try to show that in our bike protest,” said Orlando Hamilton, who founded Street Riders , a new group that organizes protest rides in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. “Where my mom lives in Bed-Stuy off Eastern Parkway, there’s no bike lanes. It’s not even nice roads, as soon as you go over to Williamsburg or Boerum Hill and Clinton Hill, the streets are smooth. It’s so obvious and blatant. They give six billion dollars to the NYPD, so I’m pretty sure we can spare a couple million to just give us a smooth street to ride on." The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment, but a police spokesman previously told Streetsblog in response to jaywalking tickets that there is no racial bias. “NYPD officers have discretion,” said the spokesman, Al Baker. “Officers enforce jaywalking if a specific condition exists, at that moment, that would require that enforcement action without consideration of race or ethnicity.

Policy & Legislation Back Policy & Legislation Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC Meet Crystal Crystal Hudson is the Council Member for New York City’s District 35 in Brooklyn, representing the neighborhoods of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Clinton Hill, and Fort Greene. A third-generation Brooklynite and daughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, she was elected in 2021 and made history as the first out gay Black woman ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people. Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for older adults and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease, and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones. Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in sports marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and later at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the NYC Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. For two years, GPHMA worked to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially older adults, undocumented immigrants, and those with underlying health conditions. During her first term in the City Council (2022-2023), Crystal introduced 78 bills and passed more legislation than any other first-term member in Brooklyn. She passed the second most bills among all new members and ranked seventh overall in the fifty-one member governing body. Her notable legislative accomplishments last session include legislation to establish unrestricted cash assistance programs, lay the groundwork for universal childcare, increase access to doula and midwife care, , the How Many Stops Act, and bills to address the growing discrimination against LGBTQIA+ communities across the country. Halfway through her second term (2024-2025), she has already introduced nearly 100 bills and passed a number of meaningful ones, including legislation to establish a Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation commission, strengthen the City’s municipal workforce, expand interagency coordination for older adult services, and more. legislative accomplishments passed a number Crystal is the author of A Black Agenda for New York City , a comprehensive policy plan that provides recommendations for city government to tangibly improve the lives of Black residents across the five boroughs. She previously served as co-chair of the Council’s LGBTQIA+ Caucus, and co-authored The Marsha & Sylvia Plan — a first-of-its-kind policy agenda outlining priorities to support New York City’s growing population of LGBTQIA+ residents. A Black Agenda for New York City The Marsha & Sylvia Plan In her first term, Crystal led two large-scale community planning efforts, including a community-led rezoning of Atlantic Avenue , and a land-use framework to ensure community priorities are integrated into the land use processes in District 35. community-led rezoning of Atlantic Avenue land-use framework As Chair of the Committee on Aging, she has launched the Age in Place legislative package and works everyday to make New York City a place where everyone can grow older with dignity and the care they need. She has passed bills that expand Right to Counsel to all older adults, mandate universal design in city-subsidized residential developments, expand long-term planning for older adult support, study the feasibility of establishing brick-and-mortar older adult services centers, expand telemedicine access for older adults, and expand digital literacy. To date, she passed nearly two-thirds of the bills in the package. Age in Place legislative package Crystal is currently co-chair of the New York City Council’s Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a master’s degree from George Washington University. Crystal lives with her wife and daughter in the district she represents. Have a question?

Policy & Legislation Back Policy & Legislation Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC Legislation A Black Agenda #AgeInPlaceNYC Seniors and advocates demand NYC ‘Age Strong’ and provide billions in more funding for aging programs Seniors and advocates from more than 50 organizations rallied at City Hall Thursday to demand that NYC provide $2.3 billion in additional funds to enhance services for older adults. LiveOn NY, a city-wide non-profit servicing older adults, joined with a coalition of more than 58 advocacy groups to launch the ‘Age Strong NYC’ campaign, an ambitious campaign calling upon Mayor Eric Adams and city leaders to invest a significant $2.3 billion for senior housing, food, community support and more. Black NYC Leaders Call For Action on Reparations And Justice A group of prominent Black city officials is advocating for reparations through a series of City Council bills, emphasizing the need for the government to be held accountable for its role in slavery and institutional racism. The bills come as New York approaches the 200-year anniversary of the end of slavery in the state. Portion of President Street to be renamed 'Lubavitcher Rebbe Way’ in honor of Chabad Lubavitch leader The City Council on Thursday approved the co-naming of a Crown Heights stretch of President Street to “Lubavitcher Rebbe Way,” in honor of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, who passed away in 1994. The Rabbi’s former home sits on the co-named block, betwen New York and Brooklyn avenues, according to the Jerusalem Post. NYC Council launches direct cash program for dozens of homeless families Dozens of low-income New York City families will soon begin receiving regular cash payments through a new program funded by the City Council. The initiative is run by the Bridge Project, an organization that will provide 161 pregnant New York City mothers who are homeless, at risk of homelessness or attempting to flee domestic violence with ongoing cash assistance over the next three years. The City Council passed a measure last year greenlighting the program before allocating $1.5 million to fund it in the current budget. ‘A force of inspiration’: Brooklyn council member declares Oct. 20 ‘New York Liberty Day’ In a significant show of support for the city’s champions, City Council Member Crystal Hudson introduced a resolution during Wednesday’s stated meeting designating Oct. 20 “New York Liberty Day.” This resolution celebrates the New York Liberty, who recently clinched their first-ever WNBA championship. The team made history on Sunday by securing the first WNBA title in franchise history, marking the first time in more than 50 years that a professional basketball championship has returned to the five boroughs. Their victory celebrates athletic excellence and highlights the ongoing progression toward equality in sports. NYC Council passes bill to study reparations for slavery New York City Council members passed legislation Thursday aimed at acknowledging, studying and addressing the impact of slavery and racial injustices in New York City, including a bill that mandates the study of reparations.  New York City had one of the highest rates of slave ownership in the country during the 1700s, according to the City Council.  One of four bills establishes a task force to consider the creation of Freedom Trails in the city. Another would require the installation of signage near Wall and Pearl Streets, to mark the site of New York's first slave market. Building in Brooklyn Council District 35? Here’s What the Rep—And Community Members—Want in New Development Councilmember Crystal Hudson’s development framework details criteria that projects in her district should meet if they need city approval for zoning changes. “We can all contribute to the housing crisis that we’re in and build more housing, but do so in a way that’s really responsive to the needs of our local communities,” the lawmaker said. Brooklyn Councilmember Crystal Hudson discusses LGBT+ safety Brooklyn Councilmember Crystal Hudson talked about why it's important to center efforts around the most marginalized communities in the city. Hudson explained the hardships behind LGBT+ youth homelessness and what's being done to help those struggling. Group of city councilmembers push for federal takeover of Rikers Island At least seven City Council members are now urging a federal judge to appoint a receiver for Rikers Island. In a letter obtained exclusively by NY1, these lawmakers say Rikers Island has only become more deadly and the only way to turn things around would be through a federal takeover. Eighteen people in custody or recently released from custody have died this year. “Over the past 11 months, many of us have visited the jails and have held public and private meetings with the Department of Correction’s executive leadership. On these visits, we have continued to witness Rikers’ deteriorating conditions and spoken with dozens of detainees who experience a lack of basic services and safety precautions,” the councilmembers wrote. “Despite promises from leadership, the jails have grown more deadly and far less transparent.” Prospect Heights Council Member Offers Free Turkeys And Music Come get your free turkey, courtesy of your local Council member! On Saturday, Nov. 19, first-term Council Member Crystal Hudson is hosting a free turkey giveaway from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Prospect Heights Educational Campus located at 883 Classon Ave. The announcement promises “all the fixins’” in addition to the seasonal birds. Childcare bills signed into law Mayor Eric Adams signed a package of childcare bills into law last week sponsored by a majority woman city council. The bills address chronic issues with the city’s child care system and access to services. “No parent leaves home without their phone, their keys, and without knowing that their child has a proper place and well-being. COVID-19 really decimated families of far too many; they had to make some strong and challenging decisions,” said Mayor Adams at the signing on Wednesday, Nov. 9. “They have lost wages and childcare in the process. We understand that and we’re focused on rightsizing to get this right.” Local Dems push for ranked choice voting Crystal Hudson may have been in first place, but she was still not officially “first,” at least not until New York City’s system of ranked choice voting was applied. Then she became the winner. Hudson was part of a webinar Tuesday night from the Democratic Party of Evanston, as DPOE tries to convince Evanstonians to change the way city officeholders are chosen. “Ranked choice voting is the way to go,” Hudson said, reflecting on her own experience running for New York’s City Council, saying the system “empowered” the voters. New $500K Plan Recruits LGBTQ+ Workers For Unions Jobs: PH Elected Council member Crystal Hudson announced Friday a $500,000 initiative to help get more LGBTQIA+ workers at unionized positions, according to the lawmaker's office. The initiative will help fund recruitment efforts at nonprofits and city agencies with the aim to get more LGBTQIA+ employed at union jobs. Funding will also prepare workers for jobs across different sectors — like building trades, pre-apprenticeships, civil service and certification exams — and provide support on the job, Hudson's office said in a release. Prospect Heights Hopes For Rat Help From New Council Member It’s not secret that rats are a major problem in this otherwise bucolic neighborhood. And finally, after years of community meetings — and dodging rats on the streets — residents say a meeting with their new council member left them with a sense of change. At the start of the meeting on Monday Sept. 26, residents were not quite seeing the light. Some told Patch that they felt frustrated by presentations on how 311 works and the basics of the Department of Health Rat Academy lessons. 51 Council Members in 52 Weeks: District 35, Crystal Hudson The majority of the New York City Council members are new and are part of a class that is the most diverse and progressive in city history. Over the next year Brian Lehrer will get to know all 51 members. This week, Councilmember Crystal Hudson, talks about her priorities for District 35, which includes Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Bedford Stuyvesant. Brooklyn firehouse reflects diversity of community A group of Brooklyn firefighters was recognized on Friday. They hail from Engine 234, which holds the distinction as one of the most diverse fire companies in the FDNY.  “We’re proud of that,” Capt. Paul Washington said. The fast-paced firehouse is stationed in the heart of Crown Heights. “Some of our members were born and raised in this community or surrounding areas so we have a special feeling for the neighborhood,” Washington said.  PIX11 News was there as City Council member Crystal Hudson stopped by to recognize Engine 234, tour the firehouse and say thank you. “These are places that we don’t actually get into all the time, and that we don’t see necessarily who’s behind the uniform,” Hudson said. “To see all different types of people serving a community that looks like me — it is inspiring.” Op-Ed: New York City isn’t ready for its aging population Our city’s affordability crisis knows no bounds. Its effects are not only unquestionably tangible today but also a harbinger of crises to come. Presently, skyrocketing rents undermine the health and wellbeing of our communities, forcing scores of long-time residents out of the neighborhoods they’ve long called home and making our city uninhabitable for the millions of poor and working class, Black and Brown New Yorkers continually pushed into the margins of society. But have you considered the effects this crisis has on older New Yorkers — those living on a fixed income, those with mobility limitations or chronic illness, those living close to the loved ones that care for them, or those who simply want to age in place in the comfort of their own homes? Hudson, older NYers call for more age-in-place protections for seniors Data shows older adults represent New York City’s “fastest growing demographic.” Councilmember Crystal Hudson, The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), and other electeds joined forces to introduce bills that will help senior tenants age in place on Sept 7. At least 23 out of the 55 census defined neighborhoods citywide have a majority immigrant older adult population, said Hudson. She added that older New Yorkers, ages 50+, generally want to age in their homes and neighborhoods rather than institutional settings. City Council and LGBTQIA+ Caucus to introduce monkeypox bills Councilmembers Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus introduced a package of bills last week to address the monkeypox crisis as well as vaccination equity and public outreach, just as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. “This City has had more than two years to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic; to study its missteps and put into place a rapid response plan to handle any future outbreaks of infectious disease effectively and efficiently,” said Hudson in a statement. Brooklyn councilmembers propose new legislation on affordable housing, monkeypox response Brooklyn councilmembers took the reins at Thursday’s regular full City Council meeting, introducing new packages of legislation relating to affordable housing, the monkeypox outbreak and more, and celebrating as their previously-written bills were approved by their colleagues. The Council on Aug. 10 overwhelmingly voted to approve a package of bills on reproductive health and maternal mortality. Four of the seven bills in the package were sponsored by Brooklyn pols, and the newly-approved legislation will create education programs, force more transparency between hospitals and birthing patients, and more. Council passes package of reproductive health legislation, expanding doula and midwifery services Building on their mission to counter the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning Roe v. Wade last month, the City Council Thursday passed a package of reproductive health and maternal mortality legislation following an abortion protections package they passed last month. The seven bill and five resolution package includes legislation requiring the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to post its annual Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Report on its website and to provide doula services to low income communities across the five boroughs as well as direct the city to distribute educational information on doula and midwifery services. LGBTQIA+ Caucus Members In BK Want To Close Monkeypox Vax Equity Gap The city is falling short on distributing the monkeypox vaccine, especially among queer minorities, a prominent Crown Heights Council Member charged this week. Crystal Hudson, co-chair of the Council's LGBTQIA+ Caucus, plans to join her colleagues in introducing bills to stop the spread of the virus. The bills also aim to focus on people of color in the LGBT communities, who have long been ignored in past inaction, she said. New York City Council's LGBTQ caucus introduces legislation calling for increased monkeypox vaccine availability As cases of monkeypox increase across the country, so are the calls for a change in the way the vaccine is distributed. As CBS2's Astrid Martinez reports, new legislation was introduced in New York by the City Council's LGBTQ caucus Thursday. Emergency orders declared. Long lines of people waiting hours for a monkeypox vaccine. New York City residents detailing their struggles to get a shot. Missing Crown Heights Teen Found After Week-Long Search, NYPD Says After going missing for over a week and spurring a neighborhood-wide search effort, a Crown Heights teenager was found Thursday, officials confirmed. "Aunisty Elliot has been found and is safe!!!" announced Brooklyn Councilmember Crystal Hudson, who spearheaded the local search efforts. Police also confirmed she has been found and is safe. Elliot, 14, went missing from her Prospect Place home on the morning of July 27. Brooklyn politician wants ‘urgency’ in search for teen The New York City Council member who represents central Brooklyn called on the NYPD to treat the disappearance of a 14-year-old girl last week with “urgency.” “We know that statistically, Black girls are labeled as runaways,” Council member Crystal Hudson observed, “even when, you know, there might be evidence of trafficking or other types of foul play.” Brooklyn Electeds Introduce Bills to Provide No-Cost Doula Services for NY’ers New York City Councilmembers Jennifer Gutiérrez, Farah Louis and Crystal Hudson last week introduced legislation to build a pipeline of no-cost professional doula services and an educational campaign across the city.  “This country has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality among high-income countries, especially when it comes to women of color,” said Gutiérrez. “We know that when people use doulas during pregnancy and birth, they’re two times less likely to have birth complications and four times less likely to have a low birth weight baby. Those are life-saving statistics” A Q&A with New York City Council LGBTQ Caucus Co-Chairs Tiffany Cabán and Crystal Hudson New York City Council Members Tiffany Cabán and Crystal Hudson are looking to shake things up as co-chairs of the council’s LGBTQ Caucus – starting with its name. “We’re finalizing our bylaws, but the name of the caucus is formally being changed to the LGBTQIA+ Caucus,” Cabán told City & State recently. Transitioning to a more inclusive name might not achieve material gains for the community, but it’s indicative of the approach that the two co-chairs are taking to lead the caucus. While the co-chairs wouldn’t talk much about a package of bills that the caucus is working on, Cabán and Hudson said they were “unapologetic” in their intention to focus on the most at-risk members of the LGBTQ community, including transgender youth and seniors as well as queer people of color. Brooklyn pol makes good on ‘Black Agenda’ campaign promise with 4 new bills Councilmember Crystal Hudson made good on her campaign policy “A Black Agenda For New York City” on Thursday, introducing a package of bills central to the policy’s goals in the City Council. Hudson, who represents parts of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights, and Bedford-Stuyvesant, introduced the policy early on in her campaign, releasing a comprehensive study identifying the most pressing needs of Black New Yorkers and a list of recommendations for elected officials way back in February 2021. Now halfway through her first year in office, Hudson is taking her own advice and introducing four bills that address health, economic, housing and discrimination justice. Council approves Atlantic Avenue buildings after Hudson negotiates more affordable units The New York City Council voted 48-1 to approve a pair of new buildings on Atlantic Avenue on Thursday, a move Brooklyn Councilmember Crystal Hudson said would change the game for affordable housing in future rezonings.

The panel will discuss a wide range of issues, including ageism, affordable housing, transportation, food security and more. Max Politics Podcast: City Council Member Crystal Hudson on Supporting Aging New Yorkers, Budget Priorities, & More City Council Member Crystal Hudson, a Democrat representing parts of Brooklyn, joined the show to discuss her work chairing the Council's Committee on Aging, city budget priorities, housing policy, and more. Bill aims to increase heat in NYC apartment buildings following deadly Bronx fire An effort is underway to require New York City apartment building landlords to turn up the heat during the coldest months of the year to help prevent devastating fires. The deadly fire back in January that killed 17 people in the Bronx, started with a space heater. City Council eyes boosting minimum heat rules The City Council is looking to turn up the heat on landlords. In a bid to reduce the use of space heaters like the one which caused the Bronx blaze in January that killed 17 people, Councilwoman Crystal Hudson (D-Brooklyn) introduced legislation that would require building owners to raise the minimum temperature in all residential units during the eight-month “heat season.” NYC Council Member Crystal Hudson Inaugurated in Brooklyn Crystal Hudson, the newly elected New York City Council Member of District 35, was sworn in to her new role at an Inauguration Ceremony on Saturday night in Brooklyn. Elected officials joined Hudson’s supporters, family, and friends for the celebration which included speakers New York Senator and the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Attorney General of New York Tish James, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Councilwoman Crystal Hudson to co-chair LGBTQ caucus Councilwoman Crystal Hudson was recently appointed co-chair of the LGBT Caucus, alongside Tiffany Cabán from Queens. She joined Errol Louis on “Inside City Hall” on Thursday to talk about some of her legislative priorities. Hudson is also the chair of the Council's Committee on Aging and represents District 35, which covers all or part of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. Op-Ed: NYC’s homecare workers need care too Imagine spending two hours on a bus and sitting on three subway trains twice a day to get to your job. Once you get there, you work for 24 hours straight but only get paid for 13 because of an archaic state law. And you’re forced to go into work during a global pandemic even if you’re not feeling well. Odds are you’d likely join the millions of workers who are voluntarily quitting their jobs and try your luck finding a new one. But many workers don’t have that choice. Resolution backs Fair Pay for Home Care Act A new New York City Council resolution calls for minimum wages for home care aids through the funding and approval of the state’s funding of the Fair Pay for Home Care act. The act also requires at least 150% of the minimum wage for home care aids, or other set minimum, and sets regional minimum rates of reimbursement under medicaid and managed care plans, according to the resolution introduced by Council Member Crystal Hudson, chair of the Committee on Aging. The legislation's main sponsors are state Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried. NYC Councilmember Hudson talks Adams’ faith leader controversy New York City Mayor Eric Adams continues to face criticism, even from within the Democratic Party, over a recent appointment. This past week, Adams named Bronx pastor Fernando Cabrera his senior faith advisor. Many City Council members, as well as New Yorkers, took issue with the appointment because of Cabrera’s past comments praising Uganda’s anti-LGBTQ policies. Bronx Fire Prompts Safety Walkthroughs At Crown Heights Buildings A long list of repairs in three major Crown Heights apartment complexes are getting renewed attention given the fatal fire in the Bronx, which was caused by a faulty space heater. Tenant leaders in the Ebbets Field apartments, Tivoli Towers and Stoddard Place complexes led a group of elected officials on a tour through their buildings this week in the hopes of correcting long-standing problems, including heat issues, that have spurred even more concern given the January fire. 'Anti-Gay' Mayoral Appointments 'Disappoint' Local LGBTQ Leader An LGBTQ local leader spoke out against Mayor Eric Adams' choice to appoint a pastor who rallied against gay marriage and a politician who praised a law criminalizing homosexuality to his administration. "As a member of the NYC Council's LGBTQ Caucus, I am disappointed with a number of [Mayor Eric Adams'] appointments," wrote Council Member Crystal Hudson, alongside a joint statement written by the City Council caucus. City Watch: New Brooklyn Councilmember Wants to Streamline Housing Aid Central Brooklyn’s newest councilmember is urging New York City and state to streamline assistance for renters in need as she settles into her first term in office amid an affordable housing shortage. Councilmember Crystal Hudson, who represents Brooklyn’s 35th District, appeared on City Watch on WBAI 99.5 FM Sunday to discuss her priorities for her first term in office. Hudson was appointed chair of the Council’s Committee on Aging earlier this month. She said one of her goals is to connect seniors with rental assistance and permanent housing after eviction protections expired Jan. 15. 13 Brooklyn Pols Appointed City Council Committee Chairs The almost all-new slate of New York City councilmembers have been hard at work at City Hall for just about three weeks now, and on Thursday they received their committee assignments, setting the course for which issues they’ll champion over the next four years. The council’s 38 committees — or 39, including a new special task force on fire prevention, formed in the wake of the deadly Twin Parks fire — handle most of the Council’s day-to-day work, hashing out the details of proposed legislation, taking votes, and holding hearings to receive feedback from the community. A number of subcommittees, including the newly-formed Subcommittee on COVID Recovery and Resilience and the often popular Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises, handle specific issues within their larger committees. Queer Councilmembers Secure Committee Assignments The seven new members of the City Council’s LGBT Caucus have received their committee assignments under City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and several of them have been tapped to serve as committee chairs. Crystal Hudson will chair the Aging Committee; Chi Ossé will lead the Cultural Affairs, Libraries, and International Intergroup Relations Committee; Lynn Schulman will be chair of the Health Committee; and Tiffany Cabán will chair the Committee on Women and Gender Equity. Crystal Hudson Keeps An Odd Campaign Promise Crystal Hudson, New York City Council Member-Elect of District 35, has kept a campaign promise she made to Crown Heights residents about an issue brought to her attention by comedian Mendy Pellin. Hudson, whose district 35 includes the neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Bedford Stuyvesant, campaigned heavily in Crown Heights ahead of the election last November. Want some good election news? Women won a majority on the N.Y. City Council For the first time ever, New York's City Council has a female majority. Thirty-one women won seats on the council in this month's municipal elections, making history and bringing gender equity — finally! — to the nation's largest and most diverse city. Believe it or not, until now, women have never held more than 18 of the council's 51 seats. That's more than two centuries as a male clubhouse dominated by old-guard elites. No longer. New voices and rising generations will have a seat at the table. And many of these victors have busted through exciting barriers of their own, which sets up a more progressive and inclusive future. Historic first with Crystal Hudson’s City Council win Democratic Candidate for City Council District 35 Crystal Hudson celebrated a win for the LGBTQ+ community in the general election last Tuesday. She made history as the first openly gay Black woman elected to the City Council. Hudson won the election by a landslide with 94.67% of the votes so far, according to the Board of Elections (BOE) unofficial election night results. Hudson said she is excited to be part of such an incredibly diverse incoming City Council with more representation than in previous years. This election season also marks the first time the City Council has majority women elected and the first Muslim woman member along with more LGBTQ+ officials. NYC Elects Record Six Out City Council Members New York City elected a record six out candidates to its City Council Tuesday night. The winners are Crystal Hudson (District 35) and Kristin Richardson Jordan (District 9), the first two Black women from the LGBTQ+ community elected to the council; Lynn Schulman (District 29) and Tiffany Cabán (District 22), the first women from the community elected to any public office from Queens; Chi Ossé (District 36), at 23 the youngest person ever elected to the council; and Erik Bottcher (District 3), who will preserve LGBTQ+ representation in his district, which is home to the Stonewall Inn. Out100 2021: 18 LGBTQ+ Policy Makers and Advocates Changing the World Public service figures prominently in Crystal Hudson’s life, and it will continue to do so as she becomes one of the first queer Black women elected to office in New York City. After winning the Democratic primary in June and facing no major opposition in November, Hudson will join the New York City Council in January. She’ll represent District 35 in Brooklyn. 8 LGBTQ candidates who could make history in November Even though it’s an off year for elections, there are still plenty of people heading to the polls across the U.S. this November — and some of them will have the option to cast their vote for a historic LGBTQ candidate. At least 237 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer candidates will be on the ballot on Nov. 2, 18.5 percent more than in the last off-year election in 2019, according to the political action committee LGBTQ Victory Fund. What Will They Do? Incoming Brooklyn Council Members Speak! After the dust settled on the primary elections for next year’s City Council [certified results here], we began reaching out to the presumptive new lawmakers from the dozens of districts that will get new leadership on Jan. 1, 2022 to see what transportation priority the incoming Council Member has at the top of his or her list. Today, we examine Brooklyn, where 13 districts are getting new leadership. Sorry, haters: Ranked-choice voting produced the most diverse city council in NYC history It's an election of firsts. While we don't yet have the certified results, it's clear from preliminary numbers that when New York's next city council takes office, it will be the most diverse in the city's history — and that's just the start of it. A 51-member council long dominated by men will have gender equity — and with at least 29 women elected, a female majority — for the first time ever.  A council that had been the province of old-guard political elites — and has never had more than 18 women — will share power with new voices and rising generations, some breaking inspiring barriers of their own. Why New York Progressives Are Pinning Their Hopes on the City Council In a City Council district in Upper Manhattan, a dozen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, including a former aide to the mayor, a tenants’ rights lawyer, a nonprofit executive, a 21-year-old college student and a drag performer with activist roots. In the Bronx, eight candidates, some of them fresh to politics, are running for a seat left vacant by a longtime political stalwart. And over in Queens, six Democratic contenders are vying for a shot at flipping that borough’s sole Republican Council seat. Comedian Mendy Pellin Calls Council Candidate Crystal Hudson Crystal Hudson, a community organizer and former member of Community Board 8, is running to succeed Laurie Cumbo as the representative of District 35 in the New York City Council in the upcoming elections on June 22. District 35 includes the neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Bedford Stuyvesant. Early voting is open from June 12 through June 20. As NYC Council-Member Crystal Hudson Would Introduce Black Agenda Crystal Hudson is running to represent New York City’s 35 Council District, which covers Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights, plus parts of Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant. While this is her first-time seeking elected office, Hudson is not a newcomer to politics. She has served as a Deputy New York City Public Advocate and as chief-of-staff to Council-member Laurie Cumbo. Prior to entering the political realm, she was a marketing and advertising executive with WNBA and later Amtrak. Hudson was instrumental in forming Amtrak’s diversity and inclusion marketing campaign. City Council Candidate Tours Rebbe’s Library Crown Heights City Council candidate Crystal Hudson visited the Library of Agudas Chassidei Chabad on Monday, and met with members of the Crown Heights Jewish community including Rabbi Berel Levine, head librarian. Hudson was accompanied by Baila Olidort, Editor-in-Chief at Lubavitch News Service, Crown Heights businessman Shaya Gorden, and community activist Yaacov Behrman. Hakeem Jeffries Endorses Crystal Hudson in Crown Heights Council Race Brooklyn Rep. Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday threw his weight behind City Council candidate Crystal Hudson, who is running to represent the 35th district in central Brooklyn. Jeffries, the fifth highest-ranking house Democrat in Washington, cited Hudson’s community activism while making his endorsement. “When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Crystal was there. When we came together to demand transformational police reform, Crystal was there,” Jeffries said May 4. “When public housing residents and those victimized by displacement needed a voice, Crystal was there.” Crown Heights Council Candidate Crystal Hudson Unveils Endorsements from Local Tenant and Community Leaders Crystal Hudson, a leading candidate in the competitive race to represent Crown Heights and nearby neighborhoods in the City Council, announced endorsements from eight local community leaders today, including tenant association presidents, activists and a prominent pastor. Hudson is running to replace her former boss, term-limited Council Member Laurie Cumbo, in the seat for Council District 35, which also includes Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, and parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The endorsees include Beverly Newsome, tenant president of the Ebbets Field Houses and a former district leader candidate who has clashed with building workers in her push for stronger rent regulations. Opinion: A Black Agenda for New York City We’re nearing the end of Black History Month — a month of celebrating and honoring the Black people who have enriched and advanced our city. From Audre Lorde to Shirley Chisolm, we have no shortage of artists, entrepreneurs, and trailblazers to celebrate. We’re also nearing the end of another February in America. A month in which we continue to see Black people die at the hands of the police at alarming rates. A month in which we continue to face a pandemic that is killing Black people at twice the rate of other Americans. A month in which our city’s vaccine roll-out continues to leave behind Black people who have experienced a disproportionate amount of loss from this crisis. OPINION: The Bedford Union Armory Project Is A Disgrace. We Can’t Let It Happen Again. Last week marked the three year anniversary of the City Council’s severely flawed decision to approve the Bedford Union Armory (BUA) development project. It was a mistake at the time, and the evidence on why it was a bad deal has only compounded since. Time and again, from BUA to East New York to Inwood, local community members who have been forced out of their homes from rising rents are given the false choice of creating a few jobs or affordable housing units only if they also accept the poison pills of luxury housing and amenities for the rich, non-union labor, and any number of other factors that ultimately hurt our communities and drive economic inequality in our city. Brooklyn LGBTQ Democrats Endorse Four Queer Council Candidates Lambda Independent Democrats of Brooklyn (LID), an LGBTQ political club, endorsed a slate of four queer City Council candidates at the organization’s virtual meeting on November 19. The club threw its support behind Crystal Hudson in District 35, Jacqui Painter in District 38, Josue Pierre in District 40, and Wilfredo Florentino in District 42. LID made the endorsements roughly seven months ahead of voters flocking to the polls for Democratic primary competitions across the city. Queer Women Vying for Council Nab 21 in ‘21 Endorsements A grassroots group aiming to bring much-needed gender diversity to the New York City Council in next year’s elections unveiled dozens of new endorsements on October 19 — including some of the out LGBTQ women running for city office. Crystal Hudson Collects Endorsements for Her Bid to Take City Council Seat Crystal Hudson recently received a string of endorsements for her bid to represent District 35 in the City Council, a seat thats currently held by term-limited City Council Majority Leader Laurie A. Cumbo. On Sept. 20, the Road to Justice NYC endorsed Hudson among its slate of four candidates who are running for various offices in 2021. The organization is comprised of union members from 1199 Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Make the Road Action and Community Voices Heard Power. EXCLUSIVE: NYCHA Tenant Leaders Endorse Crystal Hudson For City Council Tenant leaders from four New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments in the 35th Council district– which includes Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights, and parts of Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant– endorsed Crystal Hudson for City Council in the 2021 elections. Hudson, a vocal advocate for fully funding NYCHA, is vying to become the first openly LGBTQ Black woman elected to a city office. “Hudson is shaping a campaign platform that focuses on championing local issues like bike lane expansions, city rather than state control of the subway system, educational initiatives, additional job opportunities, and more,” Gay City News reported. “That approach appears to be a reflection of Hudson’s initial goal when entering the public sector: To be involved on a grassroots level in her own community.” Hudson Jumps Out of the Gate in Race to Succeed Cumbo Democratic Candidate Crystal Hudson, Co-Director of Outreach for the City Council, is running for District 35’s seat held by term-limited City Council Majority Leader and Councilmember Laurie A. Cumbo (D-Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, and Bed-Stuy). If successful, Hudson would be the first openly gay Black woman elected to City Council. Hudson credits her strides in fundraising, $66,328 currently, to her strong connections in the community and positions she held in offices for Cumbo and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. She has also served on Community Board 8, and has held positions on the boards of Lambda Independent Democrats of Brooklyn, North Prospect Heights Association, and New Leaders Council. Crystal Hudson Brings Diverse Experience to Historic Brooklyn Council Run Crystal Hudson was cruising along more than a decade into a career in advertising and marketing that included stints at the WNBA, the NBA, and Amtrak. Then everything changed. Her mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, which was especially heartbreaking because Hudson is an only child. It forced Hudson to turn into a full-time caregiver, watching her mother struggle to gain access to services and resources and helping her navigate the bureaucracy. P’Heights Organizer Launches Local Mutual Aid Network to Help Neighbors In Need A Prospect Heights do-gooder has launched a volunteer support network for local seniors and other people in need of a helping hand, saying she wanted to channel goodwill in the neighborhood toward helping local oldsters struggling during the viral coronavirus outbreak. “There’s a strong sense of community that folks feel as things become more localized,” said Crystal Hudson. Mutual aid groups, which help distribute much-needed resources between neighbors, have become a popular mechanism for communities to support themselves as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought most of the economy to a standstill, said Hudson.

The chart at right is a map of NYC median incomes. Photo: Ryan Morgan (left), Business Insider (right) You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that rich neighborhoods have the best bike infrastructure in the city — but it helps if you're an NYU grad student. Ryan Morgan, a second year Master of Urban Planning student at the esteemed downtown university and a civil engineer graduate of its uptown counterpart Columbia, blew up the internet on Wednesday by calculating "bike infrastructure grades" (left above) for each of the city's 51 community districts. Only three neighborhoods received A grades — and all are in the richest parts of Manhattan (darkest area on the right graphic above). Only four neighborhoods received B grades — two wealthy neighborhoods in Manhattan and two well-off areas of Brooklyn. The majority of neighborhoods — 33, in fact — received D or F grades. Many of them are some of the poorest sections of the city. The graphics reveal anew that the best bike infrastructure is in the richest neighborhoods — but the inverse does not hold true: some of the richest neighborhoods in the city also have what Morgan called "non-existent" bike infrastructure. Eastern Queens, all of Staten Island, and Soundview and Riverdale in the Bronx have household median incomes above the city average, yet all received "F" grades in Morgan's chart (his methodology is pictured at the bottom of this story). Receiving an "F" grade does not mean that there's no bike infrastructure, but merely that zero to 5 percent of road miles in that district feature a protected or painted bike lane (an "A" grade means that 30 to 40 percent of a neighborhood's roads feature a bike lane). A typical community board district in Eastern Queens has far more miles of roadway than, say, its counterpart on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "Of course some wealthier areas in Queens are very sparse on bike lanes," Morgan told Streetsblog. "[But] in general, I think wealthier residents and high-end real estate developers hold more sway when big decisions about priority investments are being made. That said, many of these areas are in or adjacent to the central business district which justifies a high level of investment to accommodate the high volume of commuters coming in and out every day. We should obviously be investing in bike infrastructure that helps people commute within the CBD, but that’s no excuse for not investing in outlying neighborhoods." Obviously, some neighborhoods worry about changes that are billed as "improvements," he added. "Opposition to investments based on fears of gentrification is entirely valid in today’s brutal housing climate, but it creates a vicious feedback loop," Morgan said. "Fewer investments in the transit and bicycling networks reinforces the dominance of car culture and leads to auto dependency [which fuels] an even greater barrier to investments that might take away parking or travel lanes. We need to break the cycle for planned investments to have a chance at success." To compile his "grades," Morgan weighted the results to give a higher letter grade to neighborhoods with more protected bike lanes than standard painted lanes. Other bike infrastructure, such as sharrows, were not counted at all because "they are simply shared routes that involve no separation of bicycle and vehicular traffic," he said. Streetsblog created the handy video to show how Morgan's grading system overlays with the city's median income in map form (created by Business Insider from census data).  Beyond the issue of basic equity, the most shocking thing about the chart is just how much of the city has F-level bike infrastructure. Of course, all of that can change. The city's much-ballyhoed (and much-criticized ) "Green Wave" bike-safety plan [ PDF ] calls for 30 miles of protected bike lane to be built every year (up from the de Blasio administration average of 15-20 miles per year), a lot of it in currently under-served communities. The plan specifically calls for "75 miles of both conventional and protected infrastructure in Bicycle Priority Districts," which are located in parts of Brooklyn and Queens (map right) that not only have mostly bad infrastructure now, but are also some of the poorer sections of the city. And it's important to note that when Mayor Bloomberg started building out the bike network in earnest more than a decade ago, officials at the time consciously wanted to start in areas with the most cyclists and the greatest need for the kind of safety and traffic calming that protected bike lanes instill. The city obviously could have chosen to build bike infrastructure on the outer edges and work inward, but it chose to start in the busiest areas — also where it launched Citi Bike — and expand outward. "Copenhagen wasn't built in a day, and New York is orders of magnitude larger," said Jon Orcutt of Bike NY and a former top official in the DOT. "I want an excellent and built-out bike network as much as anyone, but analyses like these mostly show that 'the city started over here and not over there.'" But Bay Ridge Council Member Justin Brannan agrees with Morgan that New York's bike network is a tale of two cities. "The 'other' boroughs are still very much an afterthought," Brannan told Streetsblog. "We also must consider the clear correlation here when it comes to areas with poor 'bike infrastructure grades' and areas that also happen to have abysmal public transportation options — because that nexus is also very real." Marco Conner of Transportation Alternatives echoed that sentiment. "Bike infrastructure is not only about safety for cyclists; it is about providing transportation options in transit deserts, better access to jobs and education for New Yorkers, and safer conditions for all road users," he said. "New Yorkers are refraining from biking because our streets are designed to be unsafe. Our elected officials cannot wait for more cyclists in their districts to justify more biking infrastructure. We must design and build for the city that we want; and if we want a safe, green and healthy city, we need protected bike infrastructure within and between all neighborhoods. Our city and elected officials are duty-bound to protect all New Yorkers. Streetsblog reached out to the Department of Transportation for an on-the-record comment and will update this story upon receipt of one.

Facebook X Mayor Bill de Blasio at Brooklyn Generation School — formerly part of the Renewal program (Patrick Wall/Chalkbeat) Mayor Bill de Blasio at Brooklyn Generation School — formerly part of the Renewal program NYC’s community schools program is getting results, study finds By Alex Zimmerman | January 28, 2020, 11:36pm UTC       Mayor Bill de Blasio has staked much of his education agenda on improving high-need schools by flooding them with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional social services and resources, efforts that have so far posted disappointing results. But research released Tuesday focused on the city’s “community schools” program — providing wrap-around services, such as additional counselors and longer school days — offers new evidence that the mayor’s approach is bearing some fruit. The study , conducted by the Rand Corp. and commissioned by the city, found the program has led to improvements in attendance, graduation rates, math scores, and the rate at which students advance to the next grade level. “The verdict is in: community schools work,” de Blasio trumpeted during a press conference Tuesday at Brooklyn’s P.S. 67. The findings are good news for a mayor whose signature $773 million school improvement program, which deployed many of the same approaches as the community schools initiative, was found to have had few positive effects and was ultimately disbanded last school year. With 267 community schools, New York City boasts the largest network of such schools in the country. Community school supporters argue students can’t learn if their basic needs are unmet, which means the schools often offer services such as washing machines, food pantries, and direct outreach to help families get their children to school . Past studies have yielded mixed results from other community school programs, but the latest findings could prompt other districts to adopt the model. “To overcome the cycle of poverty and other obstacles it is important to support the whole family,” Carmen Fariña, who ran the education department when the community school initiative launched, wrote in an email. “Real reform is finding good strategies and staying the course. No magic wand.” Still, the study includes some findings that are less encouraging. The community schools program did not improve middle or elementary school reading scores, as measured by state tests, though it did lead to a statistically significant improvement in math scores across years. And while the program kept disciplinary incidents from rising in elementary and middle schools, it had no effect on that measure among high schools. “Patience is important; whole school reforms take time to move the needle, academic achievement in particular,” said William Johnston, one of the report’s authors. “I see this as a positive story that community schools have the potential to reap benefits for students in disadvantaged communities.” The study attempts to isolate the effect of the community schools program by using student-level data to compare 113 of the city’s community schools with 399 other city schools that had similar demographics and levels of student achievement, but which did not receive a slew of new resources. Differences in outcomes between the two groups of schools could then be linked to the community schools program. The study looked at outcomes during the three school years after it was launched in 2014. Every community school uses a slightly different combination of resources, but they typically create an hour of extra learning time, conduct outreach to families to boost attendance, and receive an extra staff member to help coordinate the program. The schools also all partner with nonprofit organizations that offer a range of services, such as mental health counseling, vision screenings, or dental checkups. The program costs roughly $200 million a year; the city’s Independent Budget Office found that a majority of the money supported academics rather than social services. Those efforts helped prompt students to show up to school more often. Before the program took effect, about 40% of students at community middle and elementary schools were chronically absent, meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. By 2018, that number had dropped to roughly 32%. In contrast, the comparison schools outside the program only improved chronic absenteeism by about one percentage point. Among elementary and middle schools in the community program, disciplinary incidents stayed relatively flat, with nearly 30 incidents per 100 students a year. That bucked the trend among schools that did not receive extra help, which saw an increase of roughly 7 incidents to 37 per 100 students over the same period. The findings also include something of a mystery: Most of the community schools included in the study were also part of de Blasio’s Renewal turnaround program. The Renewal schools included in the community schools study appeared to drive much of the gains in measures including graduation rates and chronic absenteeism. That is in tension with a prior Rand report that has generally found the program failed to significantly improve graduation rates and test scores. Johnston, who was an author on both reports, said there isn’t a “definitive answer” about why Renewal schools appeared to perform so well. But he noted that the Renewal study included one less year of data and used a different statistical method to measure its impact. The study includes some important limitations: Because community schools were not randomly assigned, it’s possible that there are outside factors that the researchers couldn’t measure that affected their results. It’s also unclear whether a similar set of interventions would have the same effect in other school districts; research that tries to pinpoint why certain community schools are effective has proved inconclusive. Jennifer  Jennings, a Princeton University researcher who reviewed the report at Chalkbeat’s request, said the approach is rigorous and that the findings are promising. Still, she noted that the study doesn’t attempt to answer questions about whether an investment in community schools is better or worse than other initiatives, such as class size reductions or efforts to attract more effective teachers. “The question is really: Did it work better than other things that cost similar amounts of money or with fewer public dollars?” she said. “If I was the superintendent of [Los Angeles schools], would I take this evidence and go forward with it? I think I’d want the answers to a lot more questions before doing that given the costs.” Chalkbeat submitted a public records request in November for the study under the state’s Freedom of Information Law and was told it wouldn’t be ready until February. But the city ended up giving an advanced copy to the Washington Post, which published a story on the report Tuesday morning. “Once the report was determined to be publicly available, there should have been no further delay in disclosure” to Chalkbeat, wrote Kristin O’Neill, the assistant director of the state’s Committee on Open Government. Freddi Goldstein, a mayoral spokesperson, indicated the report should have been disclosed through the open records process. “If it’s how you’ve described, that shouldn’t have happened and I’ll make sure it doesn’t again,” she tweeted .

When the Astoria Mutual Aid Network began in March, volunteers focused on making sure homebound or down-on-their-luck neighbors had groceries. Getting food to people still represents the bulk of the group’s duties, said Maryam Mudrick, a former event planner who co-founded the organization with her partner. But requests for help have shifted. For example, the group has recently fielded queries from young mothers struggling to buy an essential: diapers. “We get the call a lot,” she said. “Diapers are f—ing expensive.” To cope with the demand, the group has used cash donations to buy diapers in bulk, and is working to open a permanent “diaper bank,” Mudrick said — a type of facility found in each borough except Queens and Staten Island . It’s just one of the ways the mutual aid group is adapting nine-plus months into the COVID-19 crisis, and how members are thinking about carrying on into 2021. The Astoria group is among dozens of mutual aid organizations that sprang up last year in New York and are still operating, some morphing into mini-relief powerhouses offering diverse services to neighbors in need. What Charity Looks Like Operating out of a Sunset Park warehouse, South Brooklyn Mutual Aid’s more than 900 volunteers have delivered over 30,000 grocery boxes to hungry neighbors from Park Slope to Bensonhurst. They’ve also distributed backpacks and school supplies to children in the area and are organizing a toy drive for the community — enough to provide gifts for the holiday season to about 300 families, according to organizer Whitney Hu. “We’ve been able to push back on what people think charity looks like. It’s not about survival, it’s about love and solidarity,” said Hu, who recently suspended her bid for a City Council seat to continue mutual aid work.

The group assists with the management of the Astoria Food Pantry on Steinway Street and 28th Avenue. Margaret Horning, a volunteer profiled by THE CITY in May, has since helped get a free store up and running. The group recently ran a coat-and-toy drive, and is working to make the diaper bank a reality. Across the Newtown Creek in Greenpoint, North Brooklyn Mutual Aid has pivoted to services beyond food, too. The group — which serves Greenpoint and Williamsburg — hosted a series of community initiatives in the summer, including cleanup brigades in McGolrick Park, and trash and compost pick-ups. On a recent Sunday, it hosted a snow removal effort starting on Russell Street days after a winter storm dumped nearly a foot on the city.

The group regularly posts updates of its events on Instagram. View this post on Instagram A post shared by North Brooklyn Mutual Aid (@nbkmutualaid) The volunteers are following in the footsteps of locals who organized during a past crisis: During the 1970s, The People’s Firehouse in Williamsburg successfully stopped the closure of a local firehouse. Today, the organization operates as the nonprofit North Brooklyn Community Center . “We stand on the shoulders of all the community leaders that came before us,” said Kevin LaCherra, a coordinator of North Brooklyn Mutual Aid. “We’re a community, you know, that has always stepped up in times when the local government abandoned us.” ‘A Political Act’ Still, covering the needs has been tough. The Astoria group has cut back to stay alive long term. For instance, members made the hard choice to stop paying for transportation to health care appointments, which they did for those who couldn’t afford a cab in the beginning of the pandemic. “We were spending thousands of dollars a month,” Mudrick said. “The word definitely got out and we were getting calls from all over Queens … People were asking, ‘Is this the taxi service?’” The group also limited its coverage area to Long Island City and Astoria. Previously, members answered requests all over the borough, helping people as far away as Flushing or the Rockaways. “Thankfully, over time, other groups have started to grow and take greater hold and be able to support their neighbors more consistently,” she said. Those include Sunnyside & Woodside Mutual Aid , Rockaway Mutual Aid & Support Network , the Queens Mutual Aid Network and aid for Flushing locals run through the MinKwon Center , among dozens of mutual networks operating all over the city. Mutual Aid NYC keeps an online directory and map of who’s doing what and where. The group also runs a hotline — (646) 437-8080 — that connects New Yorkers with help in their neighborhood.

Sign up When South Brooklyn Mutual Aid launched in March, they connected quarantined families with neighbors who could go on grocery and errand runs for them. The delivery was free, but the cost of goods and groceries was not, although some volunteers would offer to foot the bill.

Many volunteers, including Hu, found more and more families were unable to pay for their food. Some offered to pay back the cost in installments, she said. “There was no way we were going to have mothers stuck at home with young children setting up repayment plans,” Hu said. The group now purchases groceries and other goods in bulk and distributes them to families within its network, for free. Volunteers distribute “items not covered by food stamps,” Hu said, such as baby formula, diapers and household supplies. The group, Hu said, makes sure their grocery bundles are “culturally appropriate,” and supplements grains and canned food with fresh fruit and vegetables. The group also regularly hosts drives for clothes, homeware and school supplies. ‘Buy-Nothing’ Stores Members hosted a pre-Christmas “buy-nothing” toy store at the office of local Councilmember Carlos Menchaca (D–Brooklyn), complete with a gift-wrapping station in the back, where families could select toys to give their children. There’s also an online store . Other mutual aid groups have adopted “buy-nothing” models as well: North Brooklyn Mutual Aid created several mobile pop-up stores , including one permanent location in P.S.18, where people can pick out free clothes, toys and other goods. The group is running several programs under its umbrella, coordinating dozens of trash pickups, community cleanups and know-your-rights events. It even created an oral history project — North Brooklyn Narratives — to document life in the neighborhood during the COVID-19 era. “Mutual aid is very much a political act, and it’s always existed” said Natalie Green, a coordinator for North Brooklyn Mutual Aid. “So, in a lot of ways this isn’t something new, but it can be reactive and community-building. It’s a special thing.” LaCherra noted that the network was created out of a sense of abandonment from local government. “Since March, we’ve stood side by side with our neighbors to put these structures into place in a way that’s been more effective and faster than anything the mayor or the city have done so far,” he said. “It shouldn’t have to be this way, but this is the way that it is.” ‘Can’t Forget What You’ve Seen’ Back in Sunset Park, as in the early days of the pandemic, the bulk of South Brooklyn Mutual Aid’s funds come from small-dollar donations, sponsorships from local businesses and modest fundraisers. One recent example: a volunteer generated $600 by selling tote bags made from rice and potato bags. “For the most part, it’s been people opening up their pockets, or donating clothes, toys, things they don’t need anymore,” Hu said. “We’re really lucky. We’ve been propelled by a lot of community love and people learning to use their voice.” Volunteers with South Brooklyn Mutual Aid pour flour into bags at their Brooklyn Army Terminal warehouse space. Aug. 22, 2020. Credit: Hiram Alejandro Durán/THE CITY Mudrick said her organization in Astoria has run on the same type of resources: money from volunteers, donations, partnerships with businesses and, occasionally, a small grant. She estimated that over the course of nine months the group has raised about $140,000, spending it as it comes. The group has drawn 1,500 volunteers and counting. While the pace of sign-ups has slowed a bit since the spring, those who step up are usually more committed. “We definitely have more people who want to engage on a regular basis,” she said. For her, the work has brought a mindset shift — and deep satisfaction. “As tired as I am, and exhausted … I think I would be a much less happy person at the end of the past nine months if a mutual aid didn’t exist,” Mudrick said. Now the group is bracing to deal with the “extremely long-lasting” economic effects of COVID-19, she said. And even if the virus disappears, she can’t imagine a world where the group is no longer necessary. “Once you’ve seen beyond the veil, like, you can’t forget what you’ve seen, right?” she said. “So, knowing my neighbors much more closely — [like] my neighbors who live in NYCHA housing — I can’t just flip a switch and pretend like I don’t know the tremendous injustice that they’ve experienced.” Hu doesn’t know exactly what her mutual aid group will look like this time next year — perhaps a food coop, with a focus on child care aid, she said. But she’s confident the fundamentals of mutual support will remain. “The fights are going to look different, but I think the infrastructure of neighbors helping each other — and not waiting for the government to step in in times of crisis — will continue,” she said.

Mutual Aid NYC keeps an online directory and map of who’s doing what and where. The group also runs a hotline — (646) 437-8080 — that connects New Yorkers with help in their neighborhood.

Sign up When South Brooklyn Mutual Aid launched in March, they connected quarantined families with neighbors who could go on grocery and errand runs for them. The delivery was free, but the cost of goods and groceries was not, although some volunteers would offer to foot the bill. Credit: Hiram Alejandro Durán/THE CITY Credit: Weeks later, the group had to pivot. Many volunteers, including Hu, found more and more families were unable to pay for their food. Some offered to pay back the cost in installments, she said. “There was no way we were going to have mothers stuck at home with young children setting up repayment plans,” Hu said. The group now purchases groceries and other goods in bulk and distributes them to families within its network, for free. Volunteers distribute “items not covered by food stamps,” Hu said, such as baby formula, diapers and household supplies. The group, Hu said, makes sure their grocery bundles are “culturally appropriate,” and supplements grains and canned food with fresh fruit and vegetables. The group also regularly hosts drives for clothes, homeware and school supplies. ‘Buy-Nothing’ Stores Members hosted a pre-Christmas “buy-nothing” toy store at the office of local Councilmember Carlos Menchaca (D–Brooklyn), complete with a gift-wrapping station in the back, where families could select toys to give their children. There’s also an online store . Other mutual aid groups have adopted “buy-nothing” models as well: North Brooklyn Mutual Aid created several mobile pop-up stores , including one permanent location in P.S.18, where people can pick out free clothes, toys and other goods. The group is running several programs under its umbrella, coordinating dozens of trash pickups, community cleanups and know-your-rights events. It even created an oral history project — North Brooklyn Narratives — to document life in the neighborhood during the COVID-19 era.  “Mutual aid is very much a political act, and it’s always existed” said Natalie Green, a coordinator for North Brooklyn Mutual Aid. “So, in a lot of ways this isn’t something new, but it can be reactive and community-building. It’s a special thing.” LaCherra noted that the network was created out of a sense of abandonment from local government. “Since March, we’ve stood side by side with our neighbors to put these structures into place in a way that’s been more effective and faster than anything the mayor or the city have done so far,” he said. “It shouldn’t have to be this way, but this is the way that it is.” ‘Can’t Forget What You’ve Seen’ Back in Sunset Park, as in the early days of the pandemic, the bulk of South Brooklyn Mutual Aid’s funds come from small-dollar donations, sponsorships from local businesses and modest fundraisers. One recent example: a volunteer generated $600 by selling tote bags made from rice and potato bags. “For the most part, it’s been people opening up their pockets, or donating clothes, toys, things they don’t need anymore,” Hu said. “We’re really lucky. We’ve been propelled by a lot of community love and people learning to use their voice.” Credit: Hiram Alejandro Durán/THE CITY Credit: Mudrick said her organization in Astoria has run on the same type of resources: money from volunteers, donations, partnerships with businesses and, occasionally, a small grant. She estimated that over the course of nine months the group has raised about $140,000, spending it as it comes. The group has drawn 1,500 volunteers and counting. While the pace of sign-ups has slowed a bit since the spring, those who step up are usually more committed. “We definitely have more people who want to engage on a regular basis,” she said. For her, the work has brought a mindset shift — and deep satisfaction. “As tired as I am, and exhausted … I think I would be a much less happy person at the end of the past nine months if a mutual aid didn’t exist,” Mudrick said. Now the group is bracing to deal with the “extremely long-lasting” economic effects of COVID-19, she said. And even if the virus disappears, she can’t imagine a world where the group is no longer necessary. “Once you’ve seen beyond the veil, like, you can’t forget what you’ve seen, right?” she said. “So, knowing my neighbors much more closely — [like] my neighbors who live in NYCHA housing — I can’t just flip a switch and pretend like I don’t know the tremendous injustice that they’ve experienced.” Hu doesn’t know exactly what her mutual aid group will look like this time next year — perhaps a food coop, with a focus on child care aid, she said. But she’s confident the fundamentals of mutual support will remain. “The fights are going to look different, but I think the infrastructure of neighbors helping each other — and not waiting for the government to step in in times of crisis — will continue,” she said.

Mayor's Office to Prevent Gun Violence Mayor's Office to Prevent Gun Violence  311 Search all NYC.gov websites 311 Search all NYC.gov websites  Search  Home About Interventions Resources Peace Ambassadors All In   Interventions Community Partners      Print The Crisis Management  System: this network deploys  teams of credible messengers who mediate conflicts on the street and connect  high-risk individuals to services that can reduce the long-term risk of  violence. From 2010 to 2019, data shows the Crisis Management System has  contributed to an average 40% reduction in shootings across program areas  compared to 31% decline in shootings in the 17 highest violence precincts in  New York City.  Backed by a $36 million investment from the Administration and the City Council, the Crisis Management System is operated in partnership with a network      of non-profit providers in 21 precincts. Teams of “violence interrupters” – typically credible messengers who have turned their lives around – engage individuals most likely to be involved      in gun violence. The teams work to deescalate disputes before crisis or violence erupt and connect high-risk individuals to extensive networks that      provide job training, employment opportunities, mental health services and legal services to increase the likelihood of long-term violence reduction.  The effect of this effort is not only enhanced safety, but also an improved relationship between government and New Yorkers. Emerging evidence of this can be seen in some of the key indicators being tracked by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which is currently evaluating the Cure Violence component of the Crisis Management System.  Wrap Around Supportive Services School Conflict Mediation: The school-based conflict mediation component is designed to provide culturally competent programming to at-risk youth to reduce the likelihood of their involvement in violence in their school and community while increasing their attendance, academic progress, and other social measures. The program includes school-wide activities to assist in changing culture around violence and to assist schools in their response to incidents that occur in the school or community. Employment Program: Justice Plus is a flexible, wrap- around designed to support referred participants of neighborhood-based Cure Violence programs by providing a range of work readiness opportunities. These opportunities include: work experience placements, hard/vocational and soft job skills development, and job search and career awareness/planning competencies. The program participants receive stipends. Therapeutic Mental Health Services: Therapeutic mental health services are offered and designed to provide culturally competent therapeutic support to children, youth, and families impacted by gun violence by improving resilience, network support, and building skills in self-management and self-care. Legal Services: Cure Violence participants receive support from the Legal Aid Society such as how to identify a legal emergency and substantive legal issues such as criminal law, housing, family, employment issues, what to do post-conviction and the hidden civil consequences of a criminal conviction.  Legal representation is provided as needed. Anti- Gun Violence Employment Program: The Anti-Gun Violence Employment Program (AGVEP) is a seasonal employment program that employs participants (14-24) who are serviced through the New York City Crisis Management System. The program consists of two phases: a 6 week summer program and a 25 week school year program. Job responsibilities include but are not limited to community canvassing, asset mapping, data/research gathering, community outreach and coordinating/ conducting shooting responses.

Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times By Eliza Shapiro Published March 19, 2020 Updated Dec. 18, 2020 Last year, the news that only a tiny number of black students gained admission into New York City’s most selective public high school, Stuyvesant, touched off a maelstrom about race and merit in the nation’s largest school system. On Thursday, education officials announced that, one year later, almost nothing had changed: Ten black students got into Stuyvesant, out of a freshman class of roughly 760, up from seven black students last year. And only 20 Hispanic students gained entry, down from 33 last year. The overall percentage of black and Hispanic students in New York’s eight so-called specialized high schools was essentially flat compared to last year, at around 11 percent. The city’s school system as a whole is about 70 percent black and Hispanic. For decades, the only way to gain entrance into the elite schools has been to take a single, high-stakes standardized test administered on one weekend day each fall. About 27,000 eighth graders took the exam this year, and 4,265 children got into one of the schools. The specialized schools, including Stuyvesant, had about 500 fewer freshman seats available through the exam this year because, under a program called Discovery , about 20 percent of slots were reserved for low-income students who just miss the cutoff score for admission.

This issue brief describes the cumulative impact of these decisions—particularly health policy and financing decisions in New York in the last 30 years—and proposes recommendations for addressing them moving forward. Disparate COVID-19 Mortality and Morbidity in Communities of Color The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantially disparate impact on low-income communities of color in New York. The New York State Department of Health has reported that outside of New York City, the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 population for white New Yorkers is 27, while this same rate is double or even quadruple for African Americans, Latinx, and Asian New Yorkers (109, 99, and 58, respectively). In New York City, the age-adjusted fatality rate per 100,000 population was 122 for white people and 109 for Asian people, while it was 238 for Latinxs and 244 for African Americans. Rates of non-fatal cases in New York City were also far higher for African Americans and Latinxs than for whites (see Table 1). A survey describing similar disparities affecting immigrant communities in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester found that 58 percent of respondents had been sick or had a sick family member and 16 percent had lost a family member to COVID-19. The medical literature has documented the pervasive nature of racial and ethnic health disparities long before the pandemic and reiterates that there is no genetic or biologic basis for them . Rather, it is well settled that these disparities are social constructions related to social determinants of health as experienced in communities of color, such as: the nature and quality of employment opportunities; the quality of housing stock; the proximity to toxic environments; the widespread prevalence of food insecurity; and limited educational opportunities. For example, many people of color work and live in environments that are injurious for their health and impose higher risks of exposure to COVID-19. Many of these jobs have been classified as “essential” during the pandemic and the workers who fill them have been asked to risk their own health for relatively low pay. In New York City, more than 75 percent of essential and front-line workers are people of color. A recent study found that only 17 percent of Latinx workers and 20 percent of African American workers have jobs that permit working remotely, while 30 percent of white workers can do so. Similarly, housing policies founded on racially biased zoning and redlining policies have left communities of color living in low-quality housing that engenders poor health . Hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease—conditions that often lead to severe complications for COVID-19 cases— are more prevalent in non-white communities . In the Bronx, which now has the highest rate of COVID-19 in the state, 68 percent of apartments have maintenance defects . Housing disparities also mean that people of color are more likely to live in crowded conditions —when one member of the household is exposed, the effect is multiplied because of the difficulty of social distancing under crowded conditions. 1 The neighborhoods around Elmhurst Hospital—which The New York Times described as "apocalyptic" during the peak of the epidemic—have the highest rates of severe crowding (defined as a household in which there are more than 1.5 people per room) in the city: 10.5 percent in Jackson Heights and 10.9 percent in Elmhurst/Corona. People of color are also more likely to live in congregate settings like prisons or homeless shelters. Over policing of racial and ethnic minorities has continued even during the pandemic : over 80 percent of the citations and court summons issued by the New York Police Department for social distancing violations were issued to people of color—and over 90 percent of arrests were of people of color. These social determinants of health are major drivers of the substantial racial disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also important to recognize that before the pandemic, many people of color were already experiencing significant health disparities and relied on an under-resourced health care system. The remainder of this brief outlines how these structural deficits in New York’s health care system have exacerbated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income communities of color. Insurance and Access to Care The most immediate cause of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on people of color may be an unequal ability to access quality, affordable health care. Lack of access to insurance and high medical costs are major barriers to seeking testing and treatment . Both issues are more prevalent for people of color than for white people. In New York, the largest group of uninsured people is immigrants, in part because they are excluded from many public coverage programs by federal law due to waiting periods or their immigration category. The public charge rule which took effect days before the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in New York deters immigrants from enrolling in programs or using health care even when they are eligible. New York took action to help immigrants get health coverage by using state-funded Emergency Medicaid to cover cases of COVID-19 regardless of immigration status. But immigrants are not getting the help they need: a survey of immigrant communities found that 72 percent of respondents had lost their job but only 15 percent reported receiving assistance of any kind from the government. Further, enormous numbers of New Yorkers have lost health coverage because of the pandemic. African Americans in New York City reported losing health insurance twice as often as white New Yorkers (14 percent of all households compared to 6 percent). Latinx New Yorkers reported losing health insurance nearly four times as often as white New Yorkers (23 percent compared to 6 percent). Not having health insurance or having inadequate health insurance perpetuates disparities. For example, in many parts of New York there are substantial disparities in who has incurred medical debt, as described in Table 2. In Onondaga County (Syracuse), 14 percent of residents in white communities had been put into collections because of medical expenses —but in communities of color, 41 percent of residents had. Similarly large disparities are observed throughout the state—for example, in Monroe (Rochester) and Albany counties, the difference in the rate of medical debt for white communities and communities of color is 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have continued to take collection actions, including filing lawsuits against patients. A search of the public E-Court database of 11 hospitals who have a history of suing their patients revealed 122 lawsuits filed against patients between the state of emergency declaration on March 7 and March 22, 2020, when the courts stopped accepting non-emergency filings. As the courts begin accepting new civil cases again, there is likely to be a tsunami of medical debt cases—and it is unlikely that the dynamics leading to disproportionate collection actions against people of color will have changed. The medical collection infrastructure has continued unabated, despite the fact that all patients have less ability to plan ahead for care, respond to medical bill issues such as mistakes, or respond to collection actions during the pandemic. Thirty Years of State Health Policy Decisions Resulted in Allocation of Health Care Resources to Wealthy Academic Medical Centers Over Safety-Net Hospitals Communities with majority African-American and Latinx residents experience provider shortages more than other communities all over the country.  In New York, policymakers have made a number of decisions over the past 30 years that directed resources away from safety-net and community hospitals and the neighborhoods that they served. These decisions include the deregulation of hospital rates, the elimination of regional health planning agencies, and the siphoning of Indigent Care Pool funds to wealthier hospitals in lieu of true safety-net providers. The safety-net hospitals in New York serve populations that are more diverse than the state average (32 percent of patients they discharged were white in 2016 compared to 51 percent of patients overall). Thus, decisions that take resources away from these safety-net providers disproportionately hurt people of color. First, New York dismantled its process of fairly setting hospital reimbursement rates. Between 1983 and 1997, New York used an all payer rate regulation system called the New York Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology (NYPHRM). This rate setting law ensured that safety-net hospitals had adequate support to survive—reducing the number of hospitals running a deficit from 152 to 99. It also helped control growth in costs compared to national hospital costs. In 1997, New York State abandoned NYPHRM for a deregulated system that phased out commercial rate setting and the uncompensated care pool for financially distressed hospitals. Accordingly, the more powerful academic medical centers have been in a better position to command high reimbursement rates from commercial insurers and consolidate their market power than their safety-net counterparts that are located in communities of color. A second policy decision, made during the same period, resulted in the elimination of New York’s strong tradition of statewide health planning through regional Health Systems Agencies. To the extent statewide health planning still exists, it is conducted by the Public Health and Health Planning Council, which has come under fire for being unresponsive to community needs due to its domination by private interests. The annual allocation of New York’s $1.13 billion Indigent Care Pool (ICP) is a third example of structural policy decisions that result in profound disparities in communities of color and the safety-net hospitals that serve them. The ICP program is funded by federal disproportionate share hospital funding that is designed to stabilize safety-net hospitals that serve low-income communities. Although racial and ethnic health disparities persist regardless of income, research indicates that institutionalized racism leads to a situation in which people of color disproportionately live in communities that are also low-income . Unlike every other state in the nation, New York does not target these funds to safety-net hospitals, which are defined to be the top quartile of hospitals in a state that serve Medicaid and uninsured patients. Instead, New York only apportioned $520 million (or 46%) of the $1.13 billion ICP funds to the top 25 percent of safety-net hospitals and $672 million to the bottom 75 percent of hospitals that do not serve nearly as many low-income people. Taken over the past 20 years, New York’s choice to direct over half of its ICP allocation to hospitals that do not serve a substantial number of Medicaid and uninsured patients has meant its safety-net hospitals received roughly $13.4 billion less in funding than they would have if they had been located in any other state in the country. Compounding this inequity, the ICP funding is provided to relatively well-heeled hospitals even when they fail to provide patients with financial assistance . In a final injustice, the nonprofit hospitals that sued the most patients received millions more in ICP funds in excess of the amount of financial assistance that they provided to patients. The inexorable result of structural disparities in New York’s health financing and planning policies like these is the closure of 43 hospitals statewide , resulting in the loss of 21,000 beds (from almost 74,000 in 2003 to just 53,000 in 2020). These hospital closures mostly occurred in poorer neighborhoods and in neighborhoods where people of color live where there were fewer patients with health insurance or the means to pay for care—but not fewer patients. For example, the borough of Queens witnessed the closure of four safety-net hospitals (St. John’s in Flushing, 2009; Parkway in Forest Hills, 2008; St. Joseph’s in Fresh Meadows, 2004; Mary Immaculate in Jamaica, 2009), leaving Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst as the sole safety-net hospital serving one of the country’s COVID-19 epicenters. The neighborhoods with the missing and closed hospitals are the same neighborhoods where most New Yorkers are falling ill and dying from COVID-19. The Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development has mapped hospital closures over New York City’s communities of color and the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 to display this overlap. Table 3 shows the data. Manhattan, which only has 12 COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents, has 6.4 hospital beds per 1,000 residents. In the Bronx, with a COVID-19 rate over twice as high, there are only 2.7 hospital beds for every 1,000 residents. Queens, with a rate of 22 COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents—has the least hospital beds at only 1.5 per 1,000 residents. The Federal COVID-19 Hospital Funding Allocation Exacerbates the Existing Structural Disparities Against Safety-Net Hospitals Federal COVID-19 funding has exacerbated the structural disparities created by New York’s health care financing and planning decisions. The initial tranche of $72 billion (40 percent) of the $175 billion in federal COVID-19 for hospitals (created through the CARES act) was allocated through a formula based on a hospital’s past history of Medicare payments. This policy decision ensures that wealthy hospitals secure substantially more funding than safety-net hospitals , who typically have a lower Medicare volume than Medicaid and self-pay. The results are shockingly unfair within New York City. For example, New York’s richest hospital, New York-Presbyterian, received $119 million for just one facility, while the city’s public hospital system, Health + Hospitals, received just $46 million for all 11 of its hospitals combined. Nearly all of the other top nine hospitals in New York receiving the largest CARES Act payments are individual hospitals (see Table 4). And none of the other top ten hospitals serve as many patients as the Health + Hospitals system, including New York-Presbyterian, which received more than twice as much relief funding. As a result, the decision to pay out CARES Act payments based on how much the provider was paid by Medicare last year shortchanged key safety-net hospitals like Health + Hospitals Queens hospital (Elmhurst) which serve far fewer Medicare patients than wealthier hospitals. The government’s common practice of using Medicare payments as a short-cut for provider funding decisions leads to enormous structural inequalities between communities. The decision to base CARES Act funding on a Medicare formula also means that within New York State, the hardest hit regions are receiving the least amount of relief funding (see Tables 5 and 6). The gap is enormous. Providers in Schuyler County, where there have been 11 COVID-19 cases (and no deaths), received $4.6 million from the CARES Act fund—or $426,000 per case. In Queens County, where there have been over 60,000 COVID-19 cases (including 4,800 deaths), providers received $93 million—just $1,500 per case. This allocation amplifies the racial disparities in health care financing in New York State. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Schuyler County is 96 percent white,1.5 percent African American, and 1.2 percent Hispanic or Latinx (of all races). By contrast, the borough of Queens is 27 percent white, 21 percent African American, 25 percent Asian, and 27.9 percent Latinx (of all races). Thus, the federal funding for COVID-19 radically shortchanged New York’s communities of color and the safety-net institutions that serve them throughout the pandemic. Federal and state health care financing policies establish and reinforce nearly insurmountable structural inequities for low-income communities and communities of color. As a result, the hospitals that anchor care in low-income communities of color that are suffering the most from COVID-19 were already under-resourced, even before the pandemic started, and will be worse off in the future absent government intervention. Recommendations New York must do more to protect people of color from COVID-19 and its financial repercussions. In the short term, New York can decrease gaps in health insurance coverage and affordability and protect New Yorkers from medical debt collection actions. In the long term, New York must achieve universal health coverage and must distribute health care resources according to population need. Urgent Actions New York should take immediate actions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color by ensuring that New Yorkers impacted by COVID-19 have health insurance and protecting New Yorkers from medical debt collection actions. Ensure Immigrants Have Health Coverage. Prior to the COVID-19 emergency, immigrants formed one of the largest groups of uninsured in New York. Federal law and policies exclude and deter many state residents from health coverage because of their immigration status. New York could partially fill in this coverage gap by opening the Essential Plan to income-eligible New Yorkers who have had COVID-19 regardless of immigration status. This would ameliorate these racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 fatalities by providing coverage to low-income immigrant communities so that they have timely access diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This action would build on the state’s leadership in extending Emergency Medicaid coverage to low-income immigrants for testing and treatment on COVID-19. It would improve on this action by providing full health coverage, not just coverage linked directly to COVID-19. Enact a Moratorium on Medical Debt Collections and Lawsuits: As discussed above, medical debt is an issue that disproportionately impacts communities of color. The state should prohibit hospitals from filing new medical debt lawsuits or taking other collection actions against patients for the duration of the state of emergency. Reduce Interest on Medical Debt. The state should ensure that interest does not accrue on medical debt during the emergency. After the emergency, the state should limit the interest that hospitals may add to medical debt from the extraordinarily high commercial interest rate of 9 percent to the United States Treasury rate—a policy proposed by Governor Cuomo in his initial state budget proposal, but which was not enacted in the final budget. Increase Access to Hospital Financial Assistance. New York should standardize its hospital financial assistance process so that eligible low- and moderate-income patients can successfully apply no matter which hospital they go to. Target Indigent Care Pool funds to safety-net hospitals: In every other state, federal disproportionate share hospital funding is directed to true safety net hospitals that serve the highest proportions of Medicaid or uninsured patients. New York must start using these scarce resources to support the top 25 percent of true safety-net hospitals instead of diluting the funds by distributing them to every hospital. Require Hospitals to Use Relief Funds Before Billing and Suing Uninsured Patients. New York should require hospitals to prove that they filed claims with the Health Resource and Services Administration’s relief fund before attempting to collect from uninsured patients. Protect New Yorkers Struggling to Pay Insurance Premiums. For health insurers, the COVID-19 emergency has meant a financial windfall as all elective and most non-urgent care has stopped. Insurers should thus preserve coverage for those who are having trouble paying premiums. Governor Cuomo and Superintendent Lacewell took critical administrative action to temporarily achieve this. The Legislature should extend that protection for people experiencing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic until it ends and require insurers to notify members that are struggling to pay premiums of alternative coverage options and consumer assistance programs. Long-Term Solutions New York must also address the systemic problems that created this crisis for communities of color. In the realm of health policy, that means ensuring that all New Yorkers have affordable health insurance and that resources are distributed to providers based on need, not community wealth or the provider’s ability to lobby. Universal health coverage. Most New Yorkers still get health insurance through employment. The result is that an emergency of this scale automatically means millions of people lose health insurance. New York must break the link between employment and health coverage. The New York Health Act would do this by creating one public health program that covers all residents of New York, regardless of income or other characteristics. In the absence of the New York Health Act’s universal coverage, New York could also take steps to expand public programs for those who cannot get coverage through work. One way to do this would be to permanently expand the Essential Plan to cover all immigrants, not just those who have had COVID-19. New York could also build on its successful Navigator and other consumer assistance programs to conduct outreach in communities with low rates of insurance coverage but high likelihoods of qualifying for assistance. Global budgeting to stop the unfair distribution of resources to safety-net hospitals. New York cannot continue to allow “free market” forces to dictate where health care infrastructure exists. In the past, New York has taken a much stronger role in regulating hospital rates and in health care planning. Without that oversight, the result is that wealthy New Yorkers have access to a well-resourced health care system while everyone else must rely on an under-resourced, chaotic system for care. Maryland sets hospital rates for all payers, and caps the amount of revenue that hospitals may take in. New York should take steps towards a similar global budgeting process to eradicate the disparities in resources that have led to so many unnecessary deaths and illnesses. Restore a Health Planning and Certificate of Need Process That is Responsive to Affected Communities. Decisions about hospital closures must be approved by the state. The body that makes these decisions is overly influenced by the hospitals that benefit the most from consolidation and the closure of community safety-net hospitals. These decisions should take into account the need to preserve access to care in all communities, and they should be made with the full engagement of communities that are losing infrastructure. For example, the state should issue a moratorium on further hospital consolidation, downsizing, or closures. Footnotes 1.

This issue brief describes the cumulative impact of these decisions—particularly health policy and financing decisions in New York in the last 30 years—and proposes recommendations for addressing them moving forward.  Disparate COVID-19 Mortality and Morbidity in Communities of Color The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantially disparate impact on low-income communities of color in New York. The New York State Department of Health has reported that outside of New York City, the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 population for white New Yorkers is 27, while this same rate is double or even quadruple for African Americans, Latinx, and Asian New Yorkers (109, 99, and 58, respectively). In New York City, the age-adjusted fatality rate per 100,000 population was 122 for white people and 109 for Asian people, while it was 238 for Latinxs and 244 for African Americans. Rates of non-fatal cases in New York City were also far higher for African Americans and Latinxs than for whites (see Table 1). A survey describing similar disparities affecting immigrant communities in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester found that 58 percent of respondents had been sick or had a sick family member and 16 percent had lost a family member to COVID-19.  The medical literature has documented the pervasive nature of racial and ethnic health disparities long before the pandemic and reiterates that there is no genetic or biologic basis for them . Rather, it is well settled that these disparities are social constructions related to social determinants of health as experienced in communities of color, such as: the nature and quality of employment opportunities; the quality of housing stock; the proximity to toxic environments; the widespread prevalence of food insecurity; and limited educational opportunities. For example, many people of color work and live in environments that are injurious for their health and impose higher risks of exposure to COVID-19. Many of these jobs have been classified as “essential” during the pandemic and the workers who fill them have been asked to risk their own health for relatively low pay. In New York City, more than 75 percent of essential and front-line workers are people of color. A recent study found that only 17 percent of Latinx workers and 20 percent of African American workers have jobs that permit working remotely, while 30 percent of white workers can do so. Similarly, housing policies founded on racially biased zoning and redlining policies have left communities of color living in low-quality housing that engenders poor health . Hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease—conditions that often lead to severe complications for COVID-19 cases— are more prevalent in non-white communities . In the Bronx, which now has the highest rate of COVID-19 in the state, 68 percent of apartments have maintenance defects . Housing disparities also mean that people of color are more likely to live in crowded conditions —when one member of the household is exposed, the effect is multiplied because of the difficulty of social distancing under crowded conditions. 1 The neighborhoods around Elmhurst Hospital—which The New York Times described as "apocalyptic" during the peak of the epidemic—have the highest rates of severe crowding (defined as a household in which there are more than 1.5 people per room) in the city: 10.5 percent in Jackson Heights and 10.9 percent in Elmhurst/Corona. People of color are also more likely to live in congregate settings like prisons or homeless shelters. Over policing of racial and ethnic minorities has continued even during the pandemic : over 80 percent of the citations and court summons issued by the New York Police Department for social distancing violations were issued to people of color—and over 90 percent of arrests were of people of color. These social determinants of health are major drivers of the substantial racial disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also important to recognize that before the pandemic, many people of color were already experiencing significant health disparities and relied on an under-resourced health care system. The remainder of this brief outlines how these structural deficits in New York’s health care system have exacerbated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income communities of color.  Insurance and Access to Care The most immediate cause of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on people of color may be an unequal ability to access quality, affordable health care. Lack of access to insurance and high medical costs are major barriers to seeking testing and treatment . Both issues are more prevalent for people of color than for white people. In New York, the largest group of uninsured people is immigrants, in part because they are excluded from many public coverage programs by federal law due to waiting periods or their immigration category. The public charge rule which took effect days before the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in New York deters immigrants from enrolling in programs or using health care even when they are eligible. New York took action to help immigrants get health coverage by using state-funded Emergency Medicaid to cover cases of COVID-19 regardless of immigration status. But immigrants are not getting the help they need: a survey of immigrant communities found that 72 percent of respondents had lost their job but only 15 percent reported receiving assistance of any kind from the government. Further, enormous numbers of New Yorkers have lost health coverage because of the pandemic. African Americans in New York City reported losing health insurance twice as often as white New Yorkers (14 percent of all households compared to 6 percent). Latinx New Yorkers reported losing health insurance nearly four times as often as white New Yorkers (23 percent compared to 6 percent). Not having health insurance or having inadequate health insurance perpetuates disparities. For example, in many parts of New York there are substantial disparities in who has incurred medical debt, as described in Table 2. In Onondaga County (Syracuse), 14 percent of residents in white communities had been put into collections because of medical expenses —but in communities of color, 41 percent of residents had. Similarly large disparities are observed throughout the state—for example, in Monroe (Rochester) and Albany counties, the difference in the rate of medical debt for white communities and communities of color is 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have continued to take collection actions, including filing lawsuits against patients. A search of the public E-Court database of 11 hospitals who have a history of suing their patients revealed 122 lawsuits filed against patients between the state of emergency declaration on March 7 and March 22, 2020, when the courts stopped accepting non-emergency filings. As the courts begin accepting new civil cases again, there is likely to be a tsunami of medical debt cases—and it is unlikely that the dynamics leading to disproportionate collection actions against people of color will have changed. The medical collection infrastructure has continued unabated, despite the fact that all patients have less ability to plan ahead for care, respond to medical bill issues such as mistakes, or respond to collection actions during the pandemic.  Thirty Years of State Health Policy Decisions Resulted in Allocation of Health Care Resources to Wealthy Academic Medical Centers Over Safety-Net Hospitals Communities with majority African-American and Latinx residents experience provider shortages more than other communities all over the country.  In New York, policymakers have made a number of decisions over the past 30 years that directed resources away from safety-net and community hospitals and the neighborhoods that they served. These decisions include the deregulation of hospital rates, the elimination of regional health planning agencies, and the siphoning of Indigent Care Pool funds to wealthier hospitals in lieu of true safety-net providers. The safety-net hospitals in New York serve populations that are more diverse than the state average (32 percent of patients they discharged were white in 2016 compared to 51 percent of patients overall). Thus, decisions that take resources away from these safety-net providers disproportionately hurt people of color. First, New York dismantled its process of fairly setting hospital reimbursement rates. Between 1983 and 1997, New York used an all payer rate regulation system called the New York Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology (NYPHRM). This rate setting law ensured that safety-net hospitals had adequate support to survive—reducing the number of hospitals running a deficit from 152 to 99. It also helped control growth in costs compared to national hospital costs. In 1997, New York State abandoned NYPHRM for a deregulated system that phased out commercial rate setting and the uncompensated care pool for financially distressed hospitals. Accordingly, the more powerful academic medical centers have been in a better position to command high reimbursement rates from commercial insurers and consolidate their market power than their safety-net counterparts that are located in communities of color. A second policy decision, made during the same period, resulted in the elimination of New York’s strong tradition of statewide health planning through regional Health Systems Agencies. To the extent statewide health planning still exists, it is conducted by the Public Health and Health Planning Council, which has come under fire for being unresponsive to community needs due to its domination by private interests. The annual allocation of New York’s $1.13 billion Indigent Care Pool (ICP) is a third example of structural policy decisions that result in profound disparities in communities of color and the safety-net hospitals that serve them. The ICP program is funded by federal disproportionate share hospital funding that is designed to stabilize safety-net hospitals that serve low-income communities. Although racial and ethnic health disparities persist regardless of income, research indicates that institutionalized racism leads to a situation in which people of color disproportionately live in communities that are also low-income . Unlike every other state in the nation, New York does not target these funds to safety-net hospitals, which are defined to be the top quartile of hospitals in a state that serve Medicaid and uninsured patients. Instead, New York only apportioned $520 million (or 46%) of the $1.13 billion ICP funds to the top 25 percent of safety-net hospitals and $672 million to the bottom 75 percent of hospitals that do not serve nearly as many low-income people. Taken over the past 20 years, New York’s choice to direct over half of its ICP allocation to hospitals that do not serve a substantial number of Medicaid and uninsured patients has meant its safety-net hospitals received roughly $13.4 billion less in funding than they would have if they had been located in any other state in the country. Compounding this inequity, the ICP funding is provided to relatively well-heeled hospitals even when they fail to provide patients with financial assistance . In a final injustice, the nonprofit hospitals that sued the most patients received millions more in ICP funds in excess of the amount of financial assistance that they provided to patients. The inexorable result of structural disparities in New York’s health financing and planning policies like these is the closure of 43 hospitals statewide , resulting in the loss of 21,000 beds (from almost 74,000 in 2003 to just 53,000 in 2020). These hospital closures mostly occurred in poorer neighborhoods and in neighborhoods where people of color live where there were fewer patients with health insurance or the means to pay for care—but not fewer patients. For example, the borough of Queens witnessed the closure of four safety-net hospitals (St. John’s in Flushing, 2009; Parkway in Forest Hills, 2008; St. Joseph’s in Fresh Meadows, 2004; Mary Immaculate in Jamaica, 2009), leaving Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst as the sole safety-net hospital serving one of the country’s COVID-19 epicenters. The neighborhoods with the missing and closed hospitals are the same neighborhoods where most New Yorkers are falling ill and dying from COVID-19. The Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development has mapped hospital closures over New York City’s communities of color and the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 to display this overlap. Table 3 shows the data. Manhattan, which only has 12 COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents, has 6.4 hospital beds per 1,000 residents. In the Bronx, with a COVID-19 rate over twice as high, there are only 2.7 hospital beds for every 1,000 residents. Queens, with a rate of 22 COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents—has the least hospital beds at only 1.5 per 1,000 residents.  The Federal COVID-19 Hospital Funding Allocation Exacerbates the Existing Structural Disparities Against Safety-Net Hospitals Federal COVID-19 funding has exacerbated the structural disparities created by New York’s health care financing and planning decisions. The initial tranche of $72 billion (40 percent) of the $175 billion in federal COVID-19 for hospitals (created through the CARES act) was allocated through a formula based on a hospital’s past history of Medicare payments. This policy decision ensures that wealthy hospitals secure substantially more funding than safety-net hospitals , who typically have a lower Medicare volume than Medicaid and self-pay. The results are shockingly unfair within New York City. For example, New York’s richest hospital, New York-Presbyterian, received $119 million for just one facility, while the city’s public hospital system, Health + Hospitals, received just $46 million for all 11 of its hospitals combined. Nearly all of the other top nine hospitals in New York receiving the largest CARES Act payments are individual hospitals (see Table 4). And none of the other top ten hospitals serve as many patients as the Health + Hospitals system, including New York-Presbyterian, which received more than twice as much relief funding. As a result, the decision to pay out CARES Act payments based on how much the provider was paid by Medicare last year shortchanged key safety-net hospitals like Health + Hospitals Queens hospital (Elmhurst) which serve far fewer Medicare patients than wealthier hospitals. The government’s common practice of using Medicare payments as a short-cut for provider funding decisions leads to enormous structural inequalities between communities.  The decision to base CARES Act funding on a Medicare formula also means that within New York State, the hardest hit regions are receiving the least amount of relief funding (see Tables 5 and 6). The gap is enormous. Providers in Schuyler County, where there have been 11 COVID-19 cases (and no deaths), received $4.6 million from the CARES Act fund—or $426,000 per case. In Queens County, where there have been over 60,000 COVID-19 cases (including 4,800 deaths), providers received $93 million—just $1,500 per case.  This allocation amplifies the racial disparities in health care financing in New York State. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Schuyler County is 96 percent white,1.5 percent African American, and 1.2 percent Hispanic or Latinx (of all races). By contrast, the borough of Queens is 27 percent white, 21 percent African American, 25 percent Asian, and 27.9 percent Latinx (of all races). Thus, the federal funding for COVID-19 radically shortchanged New York’s communities of color and the safety-net institutions that serve them throughout the pandemic.  Federal and state health care financing policies establish and reinforce nearly insurmountable structural inequities for low-income communities and communities of color. As a result, the hospitals that anchor care in low-income communities of color that are suffering the most from COVID-19 were already under-resourced, even before the pandemic started, and will be worse off in the future absent government intervention.  Recommendations New York must do more to protect people of color from COVID-19 and its financial repercussions. In the short term, New York can decrease gaps in health insurance coverage and affordability and protect New Yorkers from medical debt collection actions. In the long term, New York must achieve universal health coverage and must distribute health care resources according to population need. Urgent Actions New York should take immediate actions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color by ensuring that New Yorkers impacted by COVID-19 have health insurance and protecting New Yorkers from medical debt collection actions. Ensure Immigrants Have Health Coverage. Prior to the COVID-19 emergency, immigrants formed one of the largest groups of uninsured in New York. Federal law and policies exclude and deter many state residents from health coverage because of their immigration status. New York could partially fill in this coverage gap by opening the Essential Plan to income-eligible New Yorkers who have had COVID-19 regardless of immigration status. This would ameliorate these racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 fatalities by providing coverage to low-income immigrant communities so that they have timely access diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This action would build on the state’s leadership in extending Emergency Medicaid coverage to low-income immigrants for testing and treatment on COVID-19. It would improve on this action by providing full health coverage, not just coverage linked directly to COVID-19. Ensure Immigrants Have Health Coverage.

Enact a Moratorium on Medical Debt Collections and Lawsuits: As discussed above, medical debt is an issue that disproportionately impacts communities of color. The state should prohibit hospitals from filing new medical debt lawsuits or taking other collection actions against patients for the duration of the state of emergency.

The state should prohibit hospitals from filing new medical debt lawsuits or taking other collection actions against patients for the duration of the state of emergency. Reduce Interest on Medical Debt. The state should ensure that interest does not accrue on medical debt during the emergency. After the emergency, the state should limit the interest that hospitals may add to medical debt from the extraordinarily high commercial interest rate of 9 percent to the United States Treasury rate—a policy proposed by Governor Cuomo in his initial state budget proposal, but which was not enacted in the final budget.

Increase Access to Hospital Financial Assistance. New York should standardize its hospital financial assistance process so that eligible low- and moderate-income patients can successfully apply no matter which hospital they go to.

Target Indigent Care Pool funds to safety-net hospitals: In every other state, federal disproportionate share hospital funding is directed to true safety net hospitals that serve the highest proportions of Medicaid or uninsured patients. New York must start using these scarce resources to support the top 25 percent of true safety-net hospitals instead of diluting the funds by distributing them to every hospital.

Require Hospitals to Use Relief Funds Before Billing and Suing Uninsured Patients. New York should require hospitals to prove that they filed claims with the Health Resource and Services Administration’s relief fund before attempting to collect from uninsured patients.

New York should require hospitals to prove that they filed claims with the Health Resource and Services Administration’s relief fund before attempting to collect from uninsured patients. Protect New Yorkers Struggling to Pay Insurance Premiums. For health insurers, the COVID-19 emergency has meant a financial windfall as all elective and most non-urgent care has stopped. Insurers should thus preserve coverage for those who are having trouble paying premiums. Governor Cuomo and Superintendent Lacewell took critical administrative action to temporarily achieve this. The Legislature should extend that protection for people experiencing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic until it ends and require insurers to notify members that are struggling to pay premiums of alternative coverage options and consumer assistance programs.

The Legislature should extend that protection for people experiencing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic until it ends and require insurers to notify members that are struggling to pay premiums of alternative coverage options and consumer assistance programs. Long-Term Solutions New York must also address the systemic problems that created this crisis for communities of color. In the realm of health policy, that means ensuring that all New Yorkers have affordable health insurance and that resources are distributed to providers based on need, not community wealth or the provider’s ability to lobby. Universal health coverage. Most New Yorkers still get health insurance through employment. The result is that an emergency of this scale automatically means millions of people lose health insurance. New York must break the link between employment and health coverage. The New York Health Act would do this by creating one public health program that covers all residents of New York, regardless of income or other characteristics. In the absence of the New York Health Act’s universal coverage, New York could also take steps to expand public programs for those who cannot get coverage through work. One way to do this would be to permanently expand the Essential Plan to cover all immigrants, not just those who have had COVID-19. New York could also build on its successful Navigator and other consumer assistance programs to conduct outreach in communities with low rates of insurance coverage but high likelihoods of qualifying for assistance.

Global budgeting to stop the unfair distribution of resources to safety-net hospitals. New York cannot continue to allow “free market” forces to dictate where health care infrastructure exists. In the past, New York has taken a much stronger role in regulating hospital rates and in health care planning. Without that oversight, the result is that wealthy New Yorkers have access to a well-resourced health care system while everyone else must rely on an under-resourced, chaotic system for care. Maryland sets hospital rates for all payers, and caps the amount of revenue that hospitals may take in. New York should take steps towards a similar global budgeting process to eradicate the disparities in resources that have led to so many unnecessary deaths and illnesses.

Restore a Health Planning and Certificate of Need Process That is Responsive to Affected Communities. Decisions about hospital closures must be approved by the state. The body that makes these decisions is overly influenced by the hospitals that benefit the most from consolidation and the closure of community safety-net hospitals. These decisions should take into account the need to preserve access to care in all communities, and they should be made with the full engagement of communities that are losing infrastructure. For example, the state should issue a moratorium on further hospital consolidation, downsizing, or closures.

Bassett, Contributor New York City's Health Commissioner Jun 27, 2016, 10:59 PM EDT For far too long, far too many lives have been cut short by the plague of gun violence in the places we live, work, play and love. We can't wait for Congress to act on gun control; it's time for the rest of us to take responsibility. For me, it means addressing gun violence as the public health emergency it is. The mission of public health is to protect and promote the health, safety and wellbeing of entire populations. When public health professionals notice a troubling trend, we can't sit on the sidelines. We must take action. When we saw that thousands of people were dying before their time due to smoking each year, we aggressively disseminated information about the harms of smoking, implemented new treatment tools and collaborated with lawmakers to raise taxes and ban smoking in public places. Our multipronged approach worked - the adult smoking rate in New York City declined by 35% between 2002 and 2014 , and the youth smoking rate fell by 53% from 2001 to 2013 . There's no reason our country can't take a similar multipronged approach to prevent gun violence. Community-based interventions like Cure Violence, a program started in Chicago by Dr. Gary Slutkin , are part of this effort. In New York City, Cure Violence aims to reduce gun violence in 17 neighborhoods that account for more than half of the city's shootings through a collaborative of community organizations and government partners delivering wraparound behavioral and social support services which have been shown to reduce violence. Advertisement We do this through the use of "credible messengers" and community mobilization techniques that aim to mediate conflicts between individuals and groups and prevent retaliatory violence before it occurs. Since its launch, the NYC Cure Violence program has grown to become the largest replication site in the world. Last year, Mayor de Blasio and the City Council expanded the successful NYC Cure Violence program to give even more New Yorkers the opportunity to live in a community not plagued by gun violence. Working alongside city agency partners and with our community partners, we're confident that New York City will remain the safest big city in the country. However, community-level interventions are not enough. Public health improvements take time and require long-term investment, sustained action and strong collaboration to see results. We need stricter gun control in the United States to prevent these senseless killings. We must prevent civilians from purchasing guns that have no purpose other than to kill people quickly and in large numbers. Additionally, we need data to inform and understand the impacts of our efforts. An unnecessary, longstanding ban on federal research has prevented the Centers for Disease Control from funding studies on nationwide gun violence for more than two decades. I support the American Medical Association's fight to lift this unnecessary ban . Ignoring the problem of gun violence won't make it go away. We Don't Work For Billionaires. We Work For You.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A Shadow System Feeds Segregation in New York City Schools Share full article 84 84 At Beacon High School in Manhattan, applicants must have an average above 90 and 3s and 4s on their state tests to gain admission. Sixty percent of its students are white or Asian, about double the percentage of those groups in the system overall. Credit... Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times By Winnie Hu and Elizabeth A. Harris June 17, 2018 No other city in the country screens students for as many schools as New York — a startling fact all but lost in the furor that has erupted over Mayor Bill de Blasio’s recent proposal to change the admissions process for the city’s handful of elite high schools. One in five middle and high schools in New York, the nation’s largest school district, now choose all of their students based on factors like grades or state test scores. That intensifies an already raw debate about equity, representation and opportunity that has raged since Mr. de Blasio proposed scrapping the one-day test now required to gain entry into New York’s eight elite high schools. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in many of the most selective screened middle and high schools , just as they are in the specialized high schools. In Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest district, there are only two selective high schools and two “highly gifted” magnet schools. Boston has seven schools that screen — all high schools — including the prestigious Boston Latin School, a feeder for Harvard University that has an entrance exam akin to New York’s specialized high school test. In Seattle, the only screened schools are two elementary schools with accelerated curriculums for “highly capable” students who pass a district-administered gifted test. “When we have a publicly funded school system, the notion that you can pick and choose your students is problematic,” said Matt Gonzales, director of the school diversity project at New York Appleseed, an organization that pushes for integrated schools. “It undermines the democratic, and free and open nature of public education.” Unlike many cities, New York, with its 1.1 million students, also has a large base of middle-class families that attend the public schools, said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. Screened schools are a way to appeal to them and keep their children in the public schools, especially in a city where public housing projects sit beside million-dollar apartments, he said.

Sixty percent of its students are white or Asian, about double the percentage of those groups in the system overall. Credit... Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times Credit... Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times By Winnie Hu and Elizabeth A. Harris By June 17, 2018 No other city in the country screens students for as many schools as New York — a startling fact all but lost in the furor that has erupted over Mayor Bill de Blasio’s recent proposal to change the admissions process for the city’s handful of elite high schools. One in five middle and high schools in New York, the nation’s largest school district, now choose all of their students based on factors like grades or state test scores. That intensifies an already raw debate about equity, representation and opportunity that has raged since Mr. de Blasio proposed scrapping the one-day test now required to gain entry into New York’s eight elite high schools. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in many of the most selective screened middle and high schools , just as they are in the specialized high schools. In Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest district, there are only two selective high schools and two “highly gifted” magnet schools. Boston has seven schools that screen — all high schools — including the prestigious Boston Latin School, a feeder for Harvard University that has an entrance exam akin to New York’s specialized high school test. In Seattle, the only screened schools are two elementary schools with accelerated curriculums for “highly capable” students who pass a district-administered gifted test. “When we have a publicly funded school system, the notion that you can pick and choose your students is problematic,” said Matt Gonzales, director of the school diversity project at New York Appleseed, an organization that pushes for integrated schools. “It undermines the democratic, and free and open nature of public education.” Unlike many cities, New York, with its 1.1 million students, also has a large base of middle-class families that attend the public schools, said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. Screened schools are a way to appeal to them and keep their children in the public schools, especially in a city where public housing projects sit beside million-dollar apartments, he said.

While Governor Cuomo extended the prohibition on evictions for those with proof of direct impact by the pandemic until late August, New York City’s housing courts–which were cramped and chaotic spaces before the pandemic–opened their doors for certain types of cases on Monday. As eviction cases begin to run their course within the courts’ chambers, New York does not have an adequate plan for addressing the long-term economic impacts of the pandemic on tenants. Below, we review pre-pandemic eviction data and the latest U.S. Census survey measuring COVID-19’s economic toll. We find that New York’s Black renter households face the greatest eviction risk as the moratorium expires. [1] Latinx tenants are also in danger of increased eviction-related housing insecurity. Figure 1. Before the pandemic, Latinx tenants were the most likely to be threatened with eviction. [2] Source: 2019 Unheard Third survey Before the pandemic began, the role of evictions in long-term housing instability among Black tenants had been well-documented by housing justice groups across the country and scholarly-organizing efforts like the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project . Evictions perpetuate poverty , especially among women-led Black households, and have long-term adverse effects on health outcomes , demonstrated by increased emergency room use and mental health hospitalizations. According to our 2019 Unheard Third survey, Latinx and Black tenants were more likely to be threatened with an eviction than white or Asian tenants (See Figure 1). Figure 2. Between 2017 and 2019, tenants living in majority Black zip codes were more than three times as likely to be evicted as tenants living in majority white zip codes. [3] Source: 2017-2019 DOI eviction data and US Census 2017 ACS 5 Year estimate. Even though Latinx tenants were more likely to be threatened with evictions than black tenants, tenants living in majority black zip codes experienced the highest average eviction rates between 2017 and 2019. Tenants living in majority black or Latinx zip codes were more likely to be evicted than those living in majority white zip codes – more than three times and more than double, respectively (see Figure 2). While we don’t have enough data to understand exactly why the threat of eviction was highest for Latinx tenants, there is emerging scholarship about the different ways landlords use evictions: in some cases to remove tenants directly, while in others to capitalize on tenants in precarious economic situations to create an “additional revenue stream from fees and fines.” Figure 3. Half of Black tenant households in New York State fell behind on their rent as of late May/early June 2020. Source: U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (weeks 1,3,5) The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color, from healthcare access to social distancing arrests . Within the housing sphere, racist lending and real estate practices, often with support from public policy, have produced an environment where black tenants were experiencing the most acute level of eviction risk before the pandemic, with the threat of eviction-related housing insecurity also extending out to Latinx tenants. [4] The pandemic has also amplified these existing racial disparities. As illustrated in Figure 3, six percent of white tenants in New York State were behind on their rent as of late May/early June, compared to 22 percent of Latinx tenants and half of black tenants. And, while the trend among Latinx, Asian, and white tenants seems to be moving downward, perhaps indicative of tenants catching up on their rent as they access unemployment benefits or return to work, the trend among black tenants is moving in the opposite direction: alarmingly upward. Analysis of nationwide employment data by the New York Times shows rising job losses in May and June among black workers relative to white and Latinx workers. This unemployment data should be viewed in the context of an existing racial wealth gap . Figure 4. A higher than average share of Latinx, Black, and Asian tenants in New York State have little or no confidence in their ability to make their next month’s rent payment. Source: U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (weeks 1,3,5) As New York State’s courts open their doors to eviction hearings this week, Black, Latinx, and Asian renters are three or four times as likely to report having little or no confidence in being able to make their next rent payment, as compared to white tenants (see Figure 4). As the summer progresses and increased unemployment benefits that have allowed many people to continue to pay their rent expire at the end of July, the steady stream of eviction cases making their way through the now open housing courts will turn into a tsunami. Based on the above Census data, paired with pre-pandemic eviction patterns, black tenants will face the greatest level of direct eviction risk, with Latinx tenants also facing a significant level of housing insecurity. It is paramount for the state to take immediate action and expand the universal eviction moratorium while developing a plan to make housing court safe and accessible. Our previous research has shown that evictions in zip codes where tenants have the right to counsel declined by 29 percent, compared to a 16 percent decline in similar zip codes without right to counsel. The city should prioritize the law’s expansion and provide funding for housing organizing and outreach in the budget for the coming year, which is being negotiated between the City Council and the Mayor this month. Finally, New York State should develop a universal and comprehensive approach for addressing rent arrears that is easily accessible to everyone impacted by the pandemic. Footnotes 1.

The Unheard Third is a scientific telephone survey designed by Community Service Society in collaboration with Lake Research Partners who administer it using Random Digit Dialing and professional interviewers. In 2019, 1,829 New York City residents were reached by cell phones and landlines from June 18 to July 20. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish and Chinese. The margin of error for the entire survey is +/- 2.29 percentage points and +/- 2.97 percentage points for the low-income component. 3. New York City has approximately 180 residential zip codes.

Organizers in other U.S. cities have observed similar dynamics around evictions. See for example “Moms 4 Housing: Redefining the Right to a Home in Oakland” : “As Fife would soon learn, ACCE’s Latino renters often faced threats and harassment, but weren’t often thrown out, “whereas black families are actually evicted, especially black mothers.” (In 2016, renters in majority-black neighborhoods of Oakland were more than twice as likely to receive an eviction notice, compared to majority-Latino neighborhoods.)” Issues Covered Affordable Housing Latest News April 24th, 2025 Testimony: The Rent Guidelines Board’s Data Supports a Rent Freeze in 2025 April 17th, 2025 Albany can stand up to Trump by defending and funding the MTA April 10th, 2025 The Trump Administration’s Reckless Assault on Public Health More News Race and Evictions in New York City Oksana Mironova Oksana Mironova New York State’s universal eviction moratorium expired last week.

New data obtained by the Legal Aid Society shows that 87 percent of the embattled public housing agency’s 174,000 apartments went without heat or hot water at some point last winter, the New York Post first reported. Obtained through a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, the data shows that between October 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, 338,918 residents went without heat or hot water, affecting 259 of 326 NYCHA developments. There were 3,559 outages in total during that period: 2,341 hot water outages and 1,218 heat outages, the data shows. “This data again demonstrates NYCHA’s daily struggle to ensure that public housing residents have access to working heat and hot water,” Lucy Newman, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, said in a statement. “As the landlord, NYCHA has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that these necessary utilities are functioning properly.” The numbers also show that developments most affected by these outages during the winter season included Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses in the Bronx. But NYCHA says the numbers have actually decreased compared to last year. “Our staff worked night and day to attack this problem and as a result 70,000 fewer NYCHA residents lost heat this winter, we shortened our response time for service interruptions from 23 hours to 9 hours, and outages lasting longer than 24 hours fell by 93 percent,” Vito Mustaciuolo, NYCHA general manager, said in a statement. “We’re proud of that progress and are already working through this summer to build on those improvements for the coming winter.” With the winter approaching, advocates are hoping the authority takes action to avoid repeating these instances. “New York’s heat season is only a few months away and we hope [NYCHA] is taking the necessary steps to avoid a reprise of last year’s widespread outages that plagued thousands of tenants in every borough,” Newman said. As part of a five-year plan, NYCHA—which is now under the oversight of a federal monitor —agreed to have no more than 15 percent of occupied apartments with temperatures below the legal limits during heating season, by October 1, 2024. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plan includes several other goals regarding lead-based paint abatement, mold incidences, elevator service, and trash collection.

Twitter YouTube  Menu Menu Home About Commentary CityLaw Elections Updates Max Politics Podcast CityLand Sponsors UPDATE: Proposed Land Use Ballot Question Seeks to Enhance Community Input Passes October 24, 2019 Image Credit: 2019 Charter Revision Commission One of the five ballot questions proposes changes to the City’s land use review process. On Election Day, November 5, 2019, voters will have a say in whether to amend the City Charter by voting on five proposed ballot measures, including one that alters ULURP requirements to allow for more community input. The 2019 Charter Revision Commission was established by the City Council in June 2018 to review the City Charter and create proposals to amend it. The Commission engaged in an extensive review process involving input from the public and experts to create five ballot proposals for the 2019 general election. The first four ballot proposals relate to ranked voting and special elections; Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) appointments and funding, Conflict of Interest Board membership and lobbying/appearance bans before agencies after leaving office, and the City Budget. For more information on these proposals, click here . Ballot Question Five contains two proposed amendments to the City’s Uniform Land Use Review Process (ULURP). Currently, the land use public review process starts with the certification of a project at the Department of City Planning. Prior to certification, project applicants are not required to notify communities, community boards or borough presidents of a pending application. Community boards, borough boards, and borough presidents are not given an opportunity to review the application until after the project has already been certified by the Department of City Planning. Once certified, community boards only have 60 days to review and vote. The application is subsequently handed to the borough president’s office, who has 30 days to review and vote on the application before returning the application to the City Planning Commission for consideration. The first amendment will require the Department of City Planning to provide a detailed project summary to affected community boards, borough boards, and borough presidents at least 30 days before the application will be certified for public review. The project summary would also need to be posted on the Department of City Planning’s website. The application as certified would also have to be substantially consistent with the project summary. This change would take effect on August 31, 2020. The second amendment will provide community boards with more time to review applications in the summer. Community boards do not always hold hearings in the summer, so if an application is certified in late spring/early summer, the community board may not have time to hold public hearings and meetings to review the application. If the amendment is approved, community boards will have 90 days to review applications certified from June 1 to July 15, and 75 days to review applications certified between July 1 and July 15. This change would take effect immediately. Image Credit: VoteEarlyNY Supporters of the proposal say the amendment would allow communities to have greater input in the land use review process. However, opponents of the proposal say that any new requirements to ULURP just delay the timeline, which can add to the overall expense of a project. Other critics of the proposal support the overall idea of giving community boards more input but believing this proposal does not do enough. For a snippet of each of these perspectives, view statements in support and opposition to the proposal here . Voters will not have to wait until Election Day to cast their votes. This election will be the first for early voting in the state of New York. From October 26 to November 3, voters can go to assigned early voting sites to cast their votes.

Officials from the New York City Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene at the opening of the Quickie Lab at Chelsea Express Sexual Health Clinic. NYCDOHMH By Tim Fitzsimons New York City’s health department on Wednesday unveiled the “Quickie Lab” at its Chelsea Express Sexual Health Clinic, a new system for gonorrhea and chlamydia tests that reduces the wait time for results from seven days to three hours. City health officials say the shorter wait time should help stem the spread of these common sexually transmitted infections, both of which are often asymptomatic. Rates of gonorrhea in particular are increasing in the U.S., almost entirely due to a sharp uptick in cases among gay men. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the new system closes a loophole at their sexual health clinics. “Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing — that’s on the slow boat, not that slow but still not that fast,” Daskalakis said. “You have to get the specimen, then it goes to lab, then the lab tests it, and the information goes back, and then the clinic releases the information, and then if you need treatment you have to come back in.” Currently that process takes about five days. Related NBC Out NBC Out NBC Out presents Pride50: LGBTQ people who are making the community proud Now, with the help of a new integrated testing system called GeneXpert, made by Cepheid, the Quickie Lab at Chelsea Express will be able to do all of that lab work in the basement of the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic. Officials say the system will be up and running soon, with extended testing hours around WorldPride NYC—Stonewall 50. Daskalakis said he’d heard a community pitch about opening a rapid STI clinic, but the problem was the size of the GeneXpert. “The machine weighs almost a ton each, so it looked pretty impossible,” Daskalakis explained. Eventually, they identified a location in the basement that didn’t require reinforced floors. "It looks like a space ship landed in Chelsea." David Persing, chief medical and technology officer at Cepheid, said all the lab work previously done  to conduct nucleic acid amplification tests, which can detect minuscule amounts of gonorrhea and chlamydia DNA, takes place in a cartridge that goes into the GeneXpert machine. Dr. Jennifer Rakeman-Cagno, Asst. Commissioner of the NYCDOHMH's Public Health Laboratory, holding a GeneXpert cartridge on Wednesday. NYCDOHMH “We essentially automated this process so that a plastic cartridge can carry out all the steps necessary to perform nucleic acid amplification tests,” Persing said. “So all you have to do now is add the sample to the cartridge and all the rest of the steps are automated.” This new technology, which the health department hopes to bring to its seven other sexual health clinics across the city, comes as the decades-long success against the spread of gonorrhea has begun to falter. Historically, U.S. rates of gonorrhea have had two peaks: during World War II, just before penicillin was commercialized, and during the so-called Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and '70s. In 1970, as rates skyrocketed, The New York Times wrote that “most medical men attribute the rising incidence of gonorrhea among young people to promiscuity, parental permissiveness and the pill, usually in that order.” The number of cases dropped from the 1970s to roughly 2010, driven by new antibiotics and increased condom use during the AIDS epidemic. But now they're back on an upswing with almost all the new cases in men who have sex with men. Persing said “part of the reason for the epidemic rise in STIs in the past year is the fact that we have a lot of asymptomatic people out there who are incubating.” “We think that it's going to be entirely possible to test and treat on the same day,” Persing said. “So you really have a dramatic effect on transmission.” A potential vaccine Even as the fight against gonorrhea appears to be slipping, as many warned could happen after the introduction of PrEP, which has lessened the risk of HIV and led some gay men to abandon condoms, there are reasons to be hopeful the disease can be controlled. Helen Petoussis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, has been investigating an unexpected side effect of Bexsero, a vaccine for meningococcal disease serogroup type B. This form of meningitis is caused by a bacteria called neisseria meningitidis , related to the neisseria gonorrhea bacteria. Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Generic HIV prevention drug coming in 2020, Gilead says From 1991 to 2007, New Zealand conducted a mass vaccination campaign because of a meningitis outbreak, and Petoussis-Harris studied its impact on gonorrhea rates. Her findings, published in 2017 in the Lancet , were stark. “Exposure to [the vaccine] was associated with reduced rates of gonorrhoea diagnosis, the first time a vaccine has shown any protection against gonorrhoea. These results provide a proof of principle that can inform prospective vaccine development not only for gonorrhoea but also for meningococcal vaccines.” Her study was the first to show that a vaccine can have be protective against gonorrhea. Petoussis-Harris said she believes there is serious potential for a gonorrhea vaccine, and pharmaceutical companies , like Bexsero’s manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, have taken notice. “It’s a good vaccine against meningococcal disease, particularly group B, and there’s a reasonable chance that there will be some cross protecting against gonorrhea," she said. Petoussis-Harris pointed to new research published this month that examined gonorrhea rates in Cuba, where officials have long vaccinated using Bexsero. That country also had gonorrhea rates there were lower than expected. A new antibiotic In addition, the growing risk of multidrug resistant gonorrhea also appears to be receding with the discovery of a novel antibiotic that is effective against the bacteria: zoliflodacin . Since 2015, the CDC has recommended testing gonorrhea with a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, chosen together because of the low likelihood that the bacteria will be resistant to both. Related NBC OUT NBC OUT When it comes to Stonewall, the myths are as famous as the riots But beyond the current two-drug regimen, there are no more powerful antibiotics that are known to kill the bacteria. Zoliflodacin, if approved to treat gonorrhea, will likely help control the epidemic as new antibiotics did in the late 1970s. Daskalakis said he believes the public health world is paying closer attention to the spread of these curable diseases after years of focus elsewhere. “The research agenda for STIs has been a little anemic — whereas HIV takes like quantum leaps every three or four years,” he said, adding he hopes the new clinic will take the stigma out of coming in for an STI test.

Facebook X Advocates gathered at City Hall to protest New York City's school discipline policies last year. (Alex Zimmerman / Chalkbeat) Advocates gathered at City Hall to protest New York City's school discipline policies last year. Student suspensions fall sharply in New York City, reversing an unusual bump the year before By Alex Zimmerman | November 1, 2019, 7:40pm UTC       Suspensions handed out to New York City public school students last year fell significantly, reversing an unusual uptick the year before. The total number of suspensions decreased 10.5% in the 2018-19 school year to 32,801, according to data released Friday by the education department. Principal suspensions, which are handed out for less serious offenses, and are typically under six days, decreased by nearly 10%. Meanwhile, more serious superintendent suspensions — which can range from a few days to an entire school year — decreased by roughly 12%. Still, big disparities remain in terms of which students are punished. Black students and students with disabilities continue to be disproportionately suspended, while white and Asian students are underrepresented. Mayor Bill de Blasio has made school discipline reform a priority since taking office in 2014. City schools have seen multiple changes to the discipline code that have limited suspensions for the city’s youngest students and for more subjective infractions such as “insubordination.” The changes have also required approval from central office administrators for a host of infractions. But these efforts have won mixed reviews from educators, who say training in alternatives to student suspensions has been scattershot and has coincided with a parallel drop in discipline within some schools. The decrease last year more than erases a 4% increase during the 2017-18 school year, the first rise in suspensions under Mayor Bill de Blasio. Chancellor Richard Carranza suggested that increase was linked to the response of a fatal school stabbing in the Bronx that year. Following that uptick, city officials rolled out more training on “restorative” approaches, a constellation of practices that favor peer mediation and conflict resolution over ejecting students from their regular schools or classes. On average, the length of the average suspension last year slid to 5.8 days compared with 7.5 days the year before. (This school year, the department tweaked the discipline code to limit most suspensions to 20 days, though they had been quietly doing that even before the policy officially changed.) Students who are suspended for more than five days on superintendent suspensions are typically sent to alternative sites, which some students have likened to jails . Overall, suspensions have fallen roughly 39% in the past five years, and major crimes in schools have fallen 32%, officials said. [Related: Here are the numbers for every NYC school ] De Blasio has championed policies that make issuing suspensions more difficult — including among students in grades K-2 — and the education department has started requiring central signoff for suspensions for certain infractions. The city has also invested in training staff members to provide alternatives to suspensions, something that community advocates have asked for. Yet, the city’s new discipline policies have drawn criticism from some educators as well as union officials. Limiting schools’ ability to suspend students without proper training in alternative approaches has made schools more chaotic and dangerous, they argue. [Calling all educators: Tell us about your experience with student discipline by filling out our survey ] The data released Friday continues to show deep disparities, and many students of color note they continue to be disproportionately targeted for discipline. A report from the city’s Independent Budget Office found black students are more likely to receive harsher suspensions than students from other racial groups for the top eight out of ten categories of infractions. Research has shown that suspensions can have a long-lasting impact. They are associated with declines in students’ academic performance , and suspended students are more likely to drop out of school and enter the juvenile-justice system. A study focusing on New York City suggests that suspensions contribute to students passing fewer classes, increasing their risk of dropping out, and lowering the odds of graduating. Nearly 45% of the city’s suspensions went to black students, even though they represent about 26% of the student population. (City officials stressed that the number has fallen about eight percentage points in the past five years.) White students accounted for nearly 9% percent of the city’s suspensions despite being roughly 15% of the city’s students. Hispanic students accounted for 39% of suspensions and are just under 41% of students. About 40% of suspensions were issued to students with disabilities last year. Overall, 20% of the city’s students are listed as having a disability. The share of suspensions among these different groups were similar to the year before. “Our schools are safe and our approach is working, and we’re going to continue to dive deeper into this work to address disparities that persist nationally, and in New York City,” Carranza said in a statement. New York City has joined many other districts working to reduce suspensions, especially for historically marginalized student groups. But even supporters of the mayor’s efforts say the city still needs to do more to ensure schools aren’t funneling certain student populations into the criminal justice system. City officials pointed to a number of initiatives to improve school climate and reduce student suspensions. They noted that the education department has overhauled an agreement with the police department to limit the situations in which police officials can send students into the criminal justice system for relatively low-level offenses. And they pointed to investments in implicit-bias training and additional social workers . Research suggests that some of the disparities in school discipline are rooted in bias from teachers and administrators. A study in Louisiana found that black students received slightly harsher punishments than white students for the same altercation; other research has shown that black students are more likely to be suspended for discretionary offenses such as insubordination. Black teachers are also less likely to suspend black students than white teachers. Some advocates cheered the continued decline in suspensions, and added that more  social support is needed. “Going forward, it is critical that the city build on these promising results by creating a solid infrastructure to institutionalize them and make the necessary additional investments in mental health services and supports, social workers, and restoratives practices to further expand on them,” said Dawn Yuster, director of the School Justice Project at Advocates for Children.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Council Will Require Developers Set Aside A Portion Of City-Funded Housing For New Yorkers Experiencing Homelessness December 19, 2019 City Hall – The New York City Council on Thursday will vote on legislation that will require developers of large housing projects receiving financial assistance from the City to allocate 15 percent of the units for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. As New York City continues to face a homelessness crisis, this legislation is designed to move more New Yorkers into stable and permanent housing. This legislation will apply to new rental buildings that have more than 40 units, and will make New York City the first large city in the country to require developers to set aside housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. This bill would go into effect in July 2020. The Council will also vote on a package of education bills that will expand the data reported by the New York City Department of Education on special education services. There are an estimated nearly 200,000 students in NYC schools who require special education services and too often parents report that their children are not getting required special education services in a timely way. These measures are designed to hold the Education Department more accountable by requiring them to provide more information about their compliance to rules that require them to provide services to students with disabilities. There is also a resolution that calls for the school system to create a chief compliance officer position so there is a designated person who will ensure schools are complying with Individualized Education Programs and other required services for students in special education. The council will also vote on legislation designed to better regulate indoor air temperatures in buildings that have not complied with legal heat requirements. Owners of those buildings would be required to install devices that can monitor and report internal temperatures in specific dwelling units. This device will report data on temperatures that individual tenants can use on and offline. The New York City Housing Maintenance Code requires building owners to maintain certain temperatures in each unit during heat season. However, tenants and owners may not always be aware if the building is being adequately heated. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to select 50 rental buildings based on factors indicating heat issues to install the device and for heat inspections. The buildings would be chosen on factors such as a high number of heat violations or complaints and other potential indicators that a building owner has failed to comply with the heating requirements set forth in the Housing Maintenance Code. Additionally, the Council will be voting on legislation that will amend current local law that currently only collects information on injuries sustained by municipal employees in the course of duty in order to include occupational diseases. Finally, the Council will vote on several land use and finance items. Housing & Buildings Legislation Requires that a percentage of dwelling units in housing development projects receiving city financial assistance be set aside for homeless individuals and families Proposed Int. No. 1211, sponsored by Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr., would require developers who receive City financial assistance for new construction of housing development projects to set aside at least 15 percent of dwelling units offered for rent in each housing development project for homeless individuals and families. The Department of Housing and Preservation would be required to annually report to the Mayor and the Speaker the number of units set aside for homeless individuals and families for each housing development project and housing preservation project that received City financial assistance, as well as whether the project is a supportive housing project. This bill would take effect on July 1, 2020. “Today, the City Council is voting on legislation that will tackle both the housing and homelessness crisis. Despite well-intentioned policies, the number of people living in shelters has reached record high numbers. Introduction 1211, which would require residential developments receiving city subsidies to set aside 15% of units for the homeless, gives us a path forward to creating what advocates and shelter residents have been calling on for years – thousands of units of new, permanent housing for the city’s most vulnerable. Legislating an increased set aside ensures that future councils and administrations will continue to do their part in addressing a crisis that one day we will eradicate. I thank Speaker Corey Johnson for leadership and support on this issue, my colleagues who showed overwhelming support for the legislation, and most importantly, the advocates from the House Our Future NY campaign for their dedication to ensuring every New Yorker has access to permanent housing,” said Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. Extends the J-51 tax exemption and abatement program through June 30, 2020, and increases the assessed value limitation from $35,000 to $40,000. Proposed Introduction No. 1710-A, sponsored by Council Member Donovan J. Richards , would extend the J-51 tax exemption and abatement program through June 30, 2020. The J-51 program is administered by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and provides tax exemption or abatement for major capital improvements on certain buildings. This bill would also raise the assessed value limitation on the units eligible for this program from $35,000 to $40,000. “As we continue to wait for reforms to our property tax system, the renewal of the J-51 tax incentives for owners of converted or renovated co-ops and condos in the outer boroughs will allow thousands of homeowners to improve living conditions and still maintain some of the most reasonably priced homes in the entire city. There are so few opportunities for homeownership in our city, which is why it is critical that we provide as much incentives as possible to ensure that there is still an affordable path to ownership for our families in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island. I’d like to thank Speaker Johnson for keeping this program active across New York City,” said Council Member Donovan J. Richards. Requires dedicated heat violation inspections and the installation of temperature reporting devices in certain multiple dwellings Proposed Introduction No. 948-A, sponsored by Council Member Ritchie J. Torres, would require HPD to select a list of 50 buildings based on such factors as the highest number of heat violations, the highest number of heat complaints, and other factors that indicate the building owner has failed to comply with the heating requirements set forth in the Housing Maintenance Code. This bill would require owners of buildings on this list to install an internet capable temperature reporting device in each dwelling unit for up to four years. The device must be capable of measuring the indoor air temperature at least once per hour and then reporting that information to a server from which the data can be viewed, through the internet or other means when no such connection is available, by both the building owner and the tenant. This bill would also require HPD to conduct targeted inspections of buildings on that list every two weeks for the duration of the heat season. “This technology would turn up the heat on landlords. In private housing not only do you have an epidemic of heat and hot water outages, but you have the added element of harassment. There are landlords who want to deprive residents of heat and hot water as a means of harassment. This legislation will bring housing code enforcement into the 21 st century. Heat and hot water are not a luxury; they are basic necessities of life,” said Council Member Ritchie J. Torres. Education Legislation Requires the New York City Department of Education to provide school-level data regarding compliance rates for students’ individualized education programs Proposed Introduction No. 559-A, sponsored by Council Member Mark Treyger, would amend Local Law 27 of 2015 to require the DOE to disaggregate by school its report on individualized education program compliance rates and provide the number and percentage of students, by school, that are receiving the full services they are entitled to. “I’m proud to have two pieces of legislation moving forward at today’s Stated Meeting. My bill, Introduction 559-A, will require the Department of Education (DOE) to expand its current reporting on Individual Education Plan (IEP) compliance rates to include reporting on a school level. This will provide a more holistic picture of what is happening in our more than 1,800 schools. Most importantly, this bill highlights what services students are not receiving, which helps ensure more transparency and accountability. Resolution 749-A encourages the DOE to create a special education Chief Compliance Officer position to ensure students with IEPs are a priority and that the DOE is in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Our students deserve the best, and these bills make sure there is true accountability. I want to thank Speaker Corey Johnson for his leadership in advancing the special education legislative package,” said NYC Council Member Mark Treyger, Chair of the Committee on Education. Calls upon the New York City Department of Education to establish a chief compliance officer position to ensure compliance with Individualized Education Programs and other requirements for students in special education Proposed Resolution No. 749-A, sponsored by Council Member Mark Treyger, calls upon the DOE to create a chief compliance officer position within the Department to ensure that DOE is in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA guarantees a free appropriate public education to eligible children with disabilities through and Individualized Education Program (IEP). It is through an IEP that a student with disabilities receives special education services. This chief compliance officer would ensure that DOE is meeting its legal mandate to provide all the services a student with disabilities is entitled to under IDEA. Requires the New York City Department of Education to report tri-annually on compliance with students’ individual education programs and to expand the services on which the department is required to annually report Proposed Introduction No. 900-A, sponsored by Council Member Ben Kallos, would amend Local Law 27 of 2015 to require the DOE to report tri-annually, rather than annually, on its provision of special education services in compliance with students’ IEPs. The bill would also add “assistive technology services” and “special transportation services” to the enumerated list of services that students with disabilities are entitled to on which DOE is required to annually report. “Int. No. 900-A builds on the work started by former Public Advocate, Tish James, forcing the Department of Education to provide more information about services for public school students with disabilities. Tish James introduced this bill while she was Public Advocate and I am proud to carry it to the finish line. The bill requires the DOE to report three times annually, rather than just once, on its provision of special education services in compliance with students’ IEPs. This will help students with disabilities receive the critical services they are entitled to receive. Thank you to Speaker Corey Johnson for his devotion to education reform and for working with us to ensure this bill’s success,” said Council Member Ben Kallos. Requires the New York City Department of Education to annually report on certain claims for payment for tuition or services Proposed Introduction No. 1380-A, sponsored by Council Member Helen Rosenthal, would require the DOE to annually report on claims for payment for tuition or services, for the preceding academic year, that resulted in a written settlement agreement with the Department. These claims are made by parents of a student with a disability pursuant to a due process complaint notice filed during the preceding academic year or a ten-day notice filed when parents believe their child is not receiving appropriate special education services in public school. The bill would also require the Department to report on the number of impartial hearing officers certified by the state education department to cover New York City, how many of those hearing officers had their certification revoked by the state education department, and how many cases hearing officers recused themselves from. “The tragic reality in our city is that some children with disabilities are still unable to receive the educational services they need and to which they are entitled. Parents are forced to exhaust all options and then front payments for special education that the City is supposed to provide. To make matters far worse, the process to reimburse parents is scuttled by bureaucratic and legal nightmares. My legislation is intended to hold the Department of Education accountable to their own commitments for special education reimbursements; stop wasting taxpayer money and resources; deliver much-needed transparency for parents and advocates; ease the bureaucratic and financial burden for parents; and, most importantly, improve education for all special-education students,” said Council Member Helen Rosenthal. Requires reports on preschool special education and early intervention services Proposed Introduction No. 1406-A, sponsored by Council Member Daniel Dromm, would require the DOE to annually report on several indicators regarding its evaluation of preschool-age children for special education services and the provision of such services. Those indicators would cover the initial referral for evaluation at the beginning of the process to the provision of such services and reporting on how many students eligible to receive such services actually receiving them, in full and partial. The bill also requires the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to annually report on several indicators regarding its provision of early intervention services to eligible infants and toddlers with disabilities. “Intro. 1406-A will help deliver appropriate special education services and early intervention services to pre-school aged children, helping put them on the path to success. This legislation builds upon the Council’s pioneering effort to improve how our schools deal with special education services. Nearly five years ago, the Council passed my bill, enacted as Local Law 27 of 2015, requiring the Department of Education to provide data on students receiving special education services. Intro 1406-A builds upon this successful effort by requiring the Department to report on preschool special education and early intervention services they currently offer. This report will help shed light on current practices and track the Department’s progress toward special education for all eligible students, no matter how economically disadvantaged or otherwise hard to reach. I want to thank Speaker Johnson, Chair Treyger and the many advocates for their commitment to this effort and to early childhood education in our city,” said Council Member Daniel Dromm. Civil Service and Labor Legislation Related to the reporting of workers’ compensation data by the City of New York Introduction No. 1604-B, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would expand the previous local law to require the collection of workers’ compensation data on occupational diseases in addition to physical injuries as well as collection of additional data overall. The bill would also require each agency to develop and implement an annual accident and illness program designed to reduce injuries and illnesses identified in the report and the mayor to submit a report on steps the city will take to develop programs to mitigate occupational injury and illnesses. “The passage of Introduction 1604 represents a win for our civil servants and taxpayers alike. Unlike the previous law, this legislation will result in a data rich report that prioritizes the prevention of injury or illness, and helps to save the city tens of millions of dollars in costly workers’ compensation claims. Among the key data points to be found within the revamped summary is the inclusion of occupational diseases, and the knowledge gained through this particular enhancement will better reveal how city employees are getting hurt or sick on the job, enable the identification of patterns within specific titles, and bring about improvements in workplace ergonomics that can keep our workers safe and healthy. I thank my colleagues, Speaker Johnson, and the Administration for supporting the passage of this bill,” said Council Member I. Daneek Miller. Extends health insurance coverage benefits to surviving family members of a deceased employee of the Department of Sanitation Introduction No. 1786, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would extend health insurance coverage benefits specifically to the surviving family of Matthew Jakubowski, who worked at the Department of Sanitation. He was killed on September 24, 2019. Extends health insurance coverage benefits to the surviving family members of a deceased employee of the Department of Transportation Introduction No. 1810, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would extend health insurance coverage benefits specifically to the surviving family of Eduardo Calle Abril, who worked at the Department of Transportation. He was killed on October 22, 2019. “Two of our city’s civil servants, Matthew Jakubowski at the Department of Sanitation and Eduardo Calle Abril at the Department of Transportation, tragically lost their lives over the course of their duty this past fall. All work has dignity, and, in gratitude for their service to our eight million plus New Yorkers, we as a government have a responsibility to ensure that the loved ones they left behind have the peace of mind they deserve. Introduction 1786 and Introduction 1810 will provide health insurance benefits to the surviving family members of these workers, and I thank my colleagues, Speaker Johnson, and the Administration for supporting the passage of these bills,” said Council Member I. Daneek Miller. Calls on the New York City Employees’ Retirement System to expand the necessary qualifications for members to be considered disabled Resolution No. 40-A , sponsored by Council Member Robert E. Cornegy Jr., would call on the New York City Employees’ Retirement System (NYCERS) to determine that members are “disabled” for purposes of receiving City disability pensions if 1) the state Workers’ Compensation Board determines that the member has a permanent partial disability and 2) the U.S. Social Security Administration determines that the member is disabled for substantial work activity and approved for social security disability benefits. “When the NYS Workers Compensation Board and the US Social Security Administration have both found an injured worker eligible for benefits the New York City Employee Retirement System (NYCERS) needs to act, not make that injured worker jump through yet another process of paperwork and delays to access their accidental disability pension. Resolution 40 says the design of this system should change to reflect the fact that in Workers Comp and in SSA, we already have two examinations as to an injured worker’s circumstances. NYCERS should take those findings and create an altogether less burdensome, easier to navigate, and more common-sense system. Thanks to all my colleagues voting in favor of efforts to make that more common-sense system a reality for New Yorkers,” said Council Member Robert E. Cornegy Jr. Parks and Recreation Legislation Co-names 55 thoroughfares and public places based on Council Member request Preconsidered Introduction No., sponsored by Council Members Adams, Ampry-Samuel, Borelli, Brannan, Chin, Deutsch, Diaz, Espinal, Jr., Gibson, Gjonaj, Holden, Koslowitz, Lander, Levin, Matteo, Miller, Perkins, Reynoso, Richards, Rodriguez, Rose, Salamanca, Jr., Torres, Treyger, Vallone and Van Bramer, would co-name 55 thoroughfares and public places, based on requests of Council Members whose district includes the location. Of these 55 co-names, 5 are either a relocation of a previously enacted co-naming or a revision to the street sign installed with respect to a previously enacted co-naming. Land Use Items MMN 1902 117 Street HPD is seeking approval for an Article XI  ax exemption and Urban Development Action Area project designation and project approval to facilitate the rehabilitation and preservation of 41 units of affordable housing, located in Council Member Bill Perkins’ district. La Hermosa The applicant, La Hermosa Christian Church, is seeking approval of a series of applications that would facilitate a mixed-use development for expansion of a church, within mixed-use building with 180 dwelling units, including approximately 45 affordable units.  The council modification will remove MIH Option 2 and retain Option 1, in Council Member Bill Perkins’s district. POPS Text Amendment A Citywide Zoning Text Amendment that would facilitate the updating of the City’s public space symbol, require public space signage for various types of POPS, and allow as-of-right the addition of publicly accessible moveable tables and chairs. The Council will be modifying the application to make clear that required signage in all Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS), includes the words “Open to Public.” Finance Items Budget Modifications The Council is considering Expense, Revenue, and Capital Budget Modifications to make midyear changes to the Fiscal 2020 Budget. Article XI Property Tax Exemptions William R. Anderson in Council Member Levine’s district, will receive a full, 32-year Article XI exemption to preserve 32 units of affordable rental housing. 1632 Hutchinson River Parkway East in Council Member Gjonaj’s district, will receive a partial, 40-year Article XI exemption to preserve 44 units of affordable rental housing. 1414 Walton Avenue in Council Member Cabrera’s district, will receive a full, 40-year Article XI exemption to preserve 60 units of affordable rental housing. 254 East 184 Street in Council Member Torres’s district, will receive a full, 40-year Article XI exemption to preserve 24 units of affordable homeownership. Evergreen and Tiebout Pillars in Council Member Torres’s district and Council Member Salamanca’s district, will receive a full, 40-year Article XI exemption to preserve 120 units of affordable rental housing. ### Council Will Require Developers Set Aside A Portion Of City-Funded Housing For New Yorkers Experiencing Homelessness December 19, 2019 City Hall – The New York City Council on Thursday will vote on legislation that will require developers of large housing projects receiving financial assistance from the City to allocate 15 percent of the units for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. As New York City continues to face a homelessness crisis, this legislation is designed to move more New Yorkers into stable and permanent housing. This legislation will apply to new rental buildings that have more than 40 units, and will make New York City the first large city in the country to require developers to set aside housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. This bill would go into effect in July 2020. The Council will also vote on a package of education bills that will expand the data reported by the New York City Department of Education on special education services. There are an estimated nearly 200,000 students in NYC schools who require special education services and too often parents report that their children are not getting required special education services in a timely way. These measures are designed to hold the Education Department more accountable by requiring them to provide more information about their compliance to rules that require them to provide services to students with disabilities. There is also a resolution that calls for the school system to create a chief compliance officer position so there is a designated person who will ensure schools are complying with Individualized Education Programs and other required services for students in special education. The council will also vote on legislation designed to better regulate indoor air temperatures in buildings that have not complied with legal heat requirements. Owners of those buildings would be required to install devices that can monitor and report internal temperatures in specific dwelling units. This device will report data on temperatures that individual tenants can use on and offline. The New York City Housing Maintenance Code requires building owners to maintain certain temperatures in each unit during heat season. However, tenants and owners may not always be aware if the building is being adequately heated. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to select 50 rental buildings based on factors indicating heat issues to install the device and for heat inspections. The buildings would be chosen on factors such as a high number of heat violations or complaints and other potential indicators that a building owner has failed to comply with the heating requirements set forth in the Housing Maintenance Code. Additionally, the Council will be voting on legislation that will amend current local law that currently only collects information on injuries sustained by municipal employees in the course of duty in order to include occupational diseases. Finally, the Council will vote on several land use and finance items. Housing & Buildings Legislation Requires that a percentage of dwelling units in housing development projects receiving city financial assistance be set aside for homeless individuals and families Proposed Int. No. 1211, sponsored by Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr., would require developers who receive City financial assistance for new construction of housing development projects to set aside at least 15 percent of dwelling units offered for rent in each housing development project for homeless individuals and families. The Department of Housing and Preservation would be required to annually report to the Mayor and the Speaker the number of units set aside for homeless individuals and families for each housing development project and housing preservation project that received City financial assistance, as well as whether the project is a supportive housing project. This bill would take effect on July 1, 2020. “Today, the City Council is voting on legislation that will tackle both the housing and homelessness crisis. Despite well-intentioned policies, the number of people living in shelters has reached record high numbers. Introduction 1211, which would require residential developments receiving city subsidies to set aside 15% of units for the homeless, gives us a path forward to creating what advocates and shelter residents have been calling on for years – thousands of units of new, permanent housing for the city’s most vulnerable. Legislating an increased set aside ensures that future councils and administrations will continue to do their part in addressing a crisis that one day we will eradicate. I thank Speaker Corey Johnson for leadership and support on this issue, my colleagues who showed overwhelming support for the legislation, and most importantly, the advocates from the House Our Future NY campaign for their dedication to ensuring every New Yorker has access to permanent housing,” said Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. Extends the J-51 tax exemption and abatement program through June 30, 2020, and increases the assessed value limitation from $35,000 to $40,000. Proposed Introduction No. 1710-A, sponsored by Council Member Donovan J. Richards , would extend the J-51 tax exemption and abatement program through June 30, 2020. The J-51 program is administered by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and provides tax exemption or abatement for major capital improvements on certain buildings. This bill would also raise the assessed value limitation on the units eligible for this program from $35,000 to $40,000. “As we continue to wait for reforms to our property tax system, the renewal of the J-51 tax incentives for owners of converted or renovated co-ops and condos in the outer boroughs will allow thousands of homeowners to improve living conditions and still maintain some of the most reasonably priced homes in the entire city. There are so few opportunities for homeownership in our city, which is why it is critical that we provide as much incentives as possible to ensure that there is still an affordable path to ownership for our families in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island. I’d like to thank Speaker Johnson for keeping this program active across New York City,” said Council Member Donovan J. Richards. Requires dedicated heat violation inspections and the installation of temperature reporting devices in certain multiple dwellings Proposed Introduction No. 948-A, sponsored by Council Member Ritchie J. Torres, would require HPD to select a list of 50 buildings based on such factors as the highest number of heat violations, the highest number of heat complaints, and other factors that indicate the building owner has failed to comply with the heating requirements set forth in the Housing Maintenance Code. This bill would require owners of buildings on this list to install an internet capable temperature reporting device in each dwelling unit for up to four years. The device must be capable of measuring the indoor air temperature at least once per hour and then reporting that information to a server from which the data can be viewed, through the internet or other means when no such connection is available, by both the building owner and the tenant. This bill would also require HPD to conduct targeted inspections of buildings on that list every two weeks for the duration of the heat season. “This technology would turn up the heat on landlords. In private housing not only do you have an epidemic of heat and hot water outages, but you have the added element of harassment. There are landlords who want to deprive residents of heat and hot water as a means of harassment. This legislation will bring housing code enforcement into the 21 st century. Heat and hot water are not a luxury; they are basic necessities of life,” said Council Member Ritchie J. Torres. Education Legislation Requires the New York City Department of Education to provide school-level data regarding compliance rates for students’ individualized education programs Proposed Introduction No. 559-A, sponsored by Council Member Mark Treyger, would amend Local Law 27 of 2015 to require the DOE to disaggregate by school its report on individualized education program compliance rates and provide the number and percentage of students, by school, that are receiving the full services they are entitled to. “I’m proud to have two pieces of legislation moving forward at today’s Stated Meeting. My bill, Introduction 559-A, will require the Department of Education (DOE) to expand its current reporting on Individual Education Plan (IEP) compliance rates to include reporting on a school level. This will provide a more holistic picture of what is happening in our more than 1,800 schools. Most importantly, this bill highlights what services students are not receiving, which helps ensure more transparency and accountability. Resolution 749-A encourages the DOE to create a special education Chief Compliance Officer position to ensure students with IEPs are a priority and that the DOE is in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Our students deserve the best, and these bills make sure there is true accountability. I want to thank Speaker Corey Johnson for his leadership in advancing the special education legislative package,” said NYC Council Member Mark Treyger, Chair of the Committee on Education. Calls upon the New York City Department of Education to establish a chief compliance officer position to ensure compliance with Individualized Education Programs and other requirements for students in special education Proposed Resolution No. 749-A, sponsored by Council Member Mark Treyger, calls upon the DOE to create a chief compliance officer position within the Department to ensure that DOE is in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA guarantees a free appropriate public education to eligible children with disabilities through and Individualized Education Program (IEP). It is through an IEP that a student with disabilities receives special education services. This chief compliance officer would ensure that DOE is meeting its legal mandate to provide all the services a student with disabilities is entitled to under IDEA. Requires the New York City Department of Education to report tri-annually on compliance with students’ individual education programs and to expand the services on which the department is required to annually report Proposed Introduction No. 900-A, sponsored by Council Member Ben Kallos, would amend Local Law 27 of 2015 to require the DOE to report tri-annually, rather than annually, on its provision of special education services in compliance with students’ IEPs. The bill would also add “assistive technology services” and “special transportation services” to the enumerated list of services that students with disabilities are entitled to on which DOE is required to annually report. “Int. No. 900-A builds on the work started by former Public Advocate, Tish James, forcing the Department of Education to provide more information about services for public school students with disabilities. Tish James introduced this bill while she was Public Advocate and I am proud to carry it to the finish line. The bill requires the DOE to report three times annually, rather than just once, on its provision of special education services in compliance with students’ IEPs. This will help students with disabilities receive the critical services they are entitled to receive. Thank you to Speaker Corey Johnson for his devotion to education reform and for working with us to ensure this bill’s success,” said Council Member Ben Kallos. Requires the New York City Department of Education to annually report on certain claims for payment for tuition or services Proposed Introduction No. 1380-A, sponsored by Council Member Helen Rosenthal, would require the DOE to annually report on claims for payment for tuition or services, for the preceding academic year, that resulted in a written settlement agreement with the Department. These claims are made by parents of a student with a disability pursuant to a due process complaint notice filed during the preceding academic year or a ten-day notice filed when parents believe their child is not receiving appropriate special education services in public school. The bill would also require the Department to report on the number of impartial hearing officers certified by the state education department to cover New York City, how many of those hearing officers had their certification revoked by the state education department, and how many cases hearing officers recused themselves from. “The tragic reality in our city is that some children with disabilities are still unable to receive the educational services they need and to which they are entitled. Parents are forced to exhaust all options and then front payments for special education that the City is supposed to provide. To make matters far worse, the process to reimburse parents is scuttled by bureaucratic and legal nightmares. My legislation is intended to hold the Department of Education accountable to their own commitments for special education reimbursements; stop wasting taxpayer money and resources; deliver much-needed transparency for parents and advocates; ease the bureaucratic and financial burden for parents; and, most importantly, improve education for all special-education students,” said Council Member Helen Rosenthal. Requires reports on preschool special education and early intervention services Proposed Introduction No. 1406-A, sponsored by Council Member Daniel Dromm, would require the DOE to annually report on several indicators regarding its evaluation of preschool-age children for special education services and the provision of such services. Those indicators would cover the initial referral for evaluation at the beginning of the process to the provision of such services and reporting on how many students eligible to receive such services actually receiving them, in full and partial. The bill also requires the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to annually report on several indicators regarding its provision of early intervention services to eligible infants and toddlers with disabilities. “Intro. 1406-A will help deliver appropriate special education services and early intervention services to pre-school aged children, helping put them on the path to success.

I want to thank Speaker Johnson, Chair Treyger and the many advocates for their commitment to this effort and to early childhood education in our city,” said Council Member Daniel Dromm. Civil Service and Labor Legislation Related to the reporting of workers’ compensation data by the City of New York Introduction No. 1604-B, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would expand the previous local law to require the collection of workers’ compensation data on occupational diseases in addition to physical injuries as well as collection of additional data overall. The bill would also require each agency to develop and implement an annual accident and illness program designed to reduce injuries and illnesses identified in the report and the mayor to submit a report on steps the city will take to develop programs to mitigate occupational injury and illnesses. “The passage of Introduction 1604 represents a win for our civil servants and taxpayers alike.

Extends health insurance coverage benefits to surviving family members of a deceased employee of the Department of Sanitation Introduction No. 1786, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would extend health insurance coverage benefits specifically to the surviving family of Matthew Jakubowski, who worked at the Department of Sanitation. He was killed on September 24, 2019. Extends health insurance coverage benefits to the surviving family members of a deceased employee of the Department of Transportation Introduction No. 1810, sponsored by Council Member I. Daneek Miller, would extend health insurance coverage benefits specifically to the surviving family of Eduardo Calle Abril, who worked at the Department of Transportation. He was killed on October 22, 2019. “Two of our city’s civil servants, Matthew Jakubowski at the Department of Sanitation and Eduardo Calle Abril at the Department of Transportation, tragically lost their lives over the course of their duty this past fall. All work has dignity, and, in gratitude for their service to our eight million plus New Yorkers, we as a government have a responsibility to ensure that the loved ones they left behind have the peace of mind they deserve. Introduction 1786 and Introduction 1810 will provide health insurance benefits to the surviving family members of these workers, and I thank my colleagues, Speaker Johnson, and the Administration for supporting the passage of these bills,” said Council Member I. Daneek Miller. Calls on the New York City Employees’ Retirement System to expand the necessary qualifications for members to be considered disabled Resolution No. 40-A , sponsored by Council Member Robert E. Cornegy Jr., would call on the New York City Employees’ Retirement System (NYCERS) to determine that members are “disabled” for purposes of receiving City disability pensions if 1) the state Workers’ Compensation Board determines that the member has a permanent partial disability and 2) the U.S. Social Security Administration determines that the member is disabled for substantial work activity and approved for social security disability benefits. “When the NYS Workers Compensation Board and the US Social Security Administration have both found an injured worker eligible for benefits the New York City Employee Retirement System (NYCERS) needs to act, not make that injured worker jump through yet another process of paperwork and delays to access their accidental disability pension.

SECTIONS SECTIONS Magazine Membership Donate Racial Justice Economic Justice Collections Glossary Collections Glossary Climate Justice Health Justice Leadership CONTENT TYPES CONTENT TYPES Magazine Webinars Membership Submissions Building a Worker Co-op Ecosystem: Lessons from the Big Apple Steve Dubb February 5, 2020 Excerpt from “FY2017-19, Working Together, Addendum,” NYC Small Business Services What if a nonprofit wrote a report and city policy actually changed as a result? Truth is, reports by nonprofits that advocate policy changes are written all the time, but most, even when full of good policy ideas, gather electronic dust. But in New York City, in January 2014, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies (FPWA) published a report, authored by its executive director Jennifer Jones Austin, titled Worker Cooperatives for New York City: A Vision for Addressing Income Inequality . There have been a lot of reports written on worker cooperatives over the past decade, including many by national nonprofits and one published by the Surdna Foundation . But none have been as influential as that 40-page report published in New York City in 2014. The report, in its executive summary, made the following top-line policy recommendations: Recognize worker cooperatives as natural vehicles for reducing the various inequalities in its economic system. Support and grow worker cooperatives within the City through the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and Department of Small Business Services (SBS). Make worker cooperatives a preferred contractor for City agencies. Provide funding to worker cooperative developers. Award capital or incubator start-up funds for worker cooperative businesses. Connect workforce funding to worker cooperatives. By June , less than six months after the report was published, New York City, which had never before spent a dime to support worker cooperatives, had launched its Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative , seeded with $1.2 million in city funds. In so doing, New York became, as Jake Blumgart wrote in Next City at the time, “the first city in the United States with a line item in its budget specifically for the development and cultivation of worker cooperatives.” It was a big step in an astonishingly short period of time, even if the $1.2 million was a drop in the bucket of the $75 billion budget the city approved that year. Fortunately for worker co-op advocates, the program has been largely successful. City spending accordingly has increased over time to Fiscal Year 2020’s allocation of $3.6 million . Of course, it wasn’t simply the report’s policy logic that led City Council to respond so promptly. The “who” behind the report mattered—a lot. First, there was the FPWA itself, a large nonprofit which in 2014 had over $6 million in revenues. It mattered too that a leading city anti-poverty agency backed the campaign, rather than just worker co-ops themselves. Additionally, Jones Austin herself was an influential city political leader, who then-mayor-elect Bill de Blasio tapped to co-chair his 60-person transition team . And FPWA was backed by its many coalition partners, who mobilized to support the budget allocation, testifying at a city council committee hearing held a month after the report came out. For example, at the hearing, Elizabeth Mendoza, a worker-owner of the Beyond Care childcare co-op incubated by the nonprofit Center for Family Life , located in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood, told the Council committee: In 2008, I had the opportunity to begin working with the cooperative Beyond Care. My life changed completely—personally, professionally, and economically. The beginning of the cooperative was not easy. No one knew about our co-op; we did volunteer work at organizations and universities and often gave childcare in exchange for opportunities to market our group in the places we volunteered. I had basic English then. I have learned so much more. I have also learned to use computers. My salary is better. I work the amount of time I want to work … My first daughter will graduate from college in June. My youngest son is in third grade. The best benefit of all of this is giving my children the opportunity to have a better education. Mendoza added that the co-op, which had begun with 25 members, had grown to 40 members, while wages had climbed from $10 an hour or less before the co-op formed to $16 an hour. Beyond Care, of course, was one of a number of worker co-ops that had developed in New York City before 2014, even in the absence of policy support. Now that the city has supported worker co-op development for over five years, what can we say about the policy’s effectiveness? Understanding the Policy Framework The framework established largely followed the vision set forth in FPWA’s report. The lead agency ended up being Small Business Services (SBS), one of the two city agencies named in the report. In its first-year report on what ended up being called the Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative, SBS indicated that, the initiative, which disbursed funds to ten organizations, aimed “to share information with prospective entrepreneurs, support existing worker cooperatives, spur the creation of new worker cooperatives, and help small businesses transition into the worker cooperative model.” Sign up for our free newsletters Subscribe to NPQ's newsletters to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from NPQ and our partners. The initial ten nonprofits involved in product delivery included a couple of national nonprofits that support worker cooperatives ( Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI) and ICA Group ), a couple of local co-op specific organizations ( Bronx Cooperative Development Initiative and Green Worker Cooperatives ), a worker co-op-focused loan fund ( The Working World ), the city co-op trade association ( New York City Network of Worker Cooperatives ), a nonprofit which had historically been the city’s leading worker co-op developer ( Center for Family Life ), and three community-based nonprofits (FPWA, Make the Road New York , and Urban Justice Center ). Over time, the composition of the nonprofit partners has changed, Two of the three community-based nonprofits (FPWA and Make the Road New York) are no longer directly involved, and Urban Justice Center’s role has been taken over by Takeroot Justice , which spun off from the organization. Meanwhile, five new nonprofits have been added to the mix, including two business-support nonprofits ( CAMBA Small Business Services and Business Outreach Center Network ), the City University of New York’s community and economic development law clinic , and two anti-poverty nonprofits ( Urban Upbound and Worker’s Justice Project ) Different nonprofits have played different roles. Some nonprofits focus on community outreach and education. For instance, over the past three years of the program, WCBDI-funded nonprofits have conducted educational workshops and trainings that have reached over 8,000 New Yorkers . On the WCBDI website, nonprofits roles are set forth in five distinct categories—1) groups that help with worker co-op startups; 2) groups that provide one-on-one support services (business plan development, accounting, etc.); 3) groups that provide worker co-ops with legal support; 4) groups that focus on converting existing businesses into worker co-ops (which, as NPQ has detailed , is an essential strategy for maintaining existing businesses as Baby Boomer owners retire); and 5) one group (the Working World) that helps finance worker co-ops. While most of the direct project work has been done by and through the nonprofit partners, SBS has played an essential role in helping legitimize worker cooperatives in New York City as a respectable way of operating a business. For instance, in the first year of the program, SBS created and offered a course called “Ten Steps to Starting a Worker Cooperative,” with sessions held at NYC Business Solutions Centers in Lower Manhattan, Harlem, and the Bronx. The agency also in the first year of the program created a two-page brochure on workers co-ops that remains available at the city’s seven SBS offices and on its website. The Big Apple’s approach of working with multiple nonprofits reflected the coalition that had testified at City Council back in 2014 and had made passage of a city worker co-op support policy possible. At the same time, it is important to understand how the approach differed from past efforts. When the New York City policy was adopted, the leading philanthropic-backed US worker co-op development approach was the one pursued by the Cleveland Foundation , which had backed the launch of the Evergreen Cooperative network, a centralized model that aimed to launch a group of cooperatives from a single, well-funded incubator nonprofit. New York City—perhaps by design, but more likely due to the momentum created by the organizing coalition—took a different tack. Rather than make one big bet, it made a lot of small ones. This has led to far more rapid creation of cooperatives than what a centralized single incubator model has been able to produce. The diverse network of nonprofits involved also likely helps reach the immigrant workforce that to date has been at the heart of New York City’s worker co-op boom. According to the city’s annual reports on the program, in the first year alone 21 new worker cooperatives were formed. One challenge with the multiple nonprofit approach, though, is that the co-ops by and large formed in New York City have been much smaller than the co-ops created through a centralized single incubator model. While New York City’s program in Fiscal Year 2015 supported 21 co-ops, these co-ops had a total of 141 worker-owners, an average of less than seven worker-owners per co-op. (By contrast, Evergreen has formed three co-ops over the course of a decade, but those three co-ops as of 2018 employed 220 people .) Despite their small size, however, the New York City co-ops have displayed considerable staying power. As the city’s Fiscal Year 2019 report indicates, “In its first year, the NYC Council distributed $1.2 million across 10 partner organizations who assisted in the creation of 21 worker-owned cooperatives. Fourteen (67 percent) of those businesses are still in operation — surpassing the national five-year survival rate for small businesses (about 50 percent).” Whither Worker Co-op Policy Today? It is worth noting that New York City’s model has had broad influence outside the Big Apple. A number of cities have, with tweaks, adopted what Michelle Camou and others have labeled the “ ecosystem approach .” Madison, Wisconsin is one of the more prominent, allocating $3 million over five years to support worker co-op development through a process managed by the Madison Cooperative Development Coalition . Minneapolis, albeit at a smaller scale, has implemented a similar approach . In California, a policy passed in Berkeley last year aligns in a similar direction. Meanwhile, efforts to strengthen the worker co-op ecosystem continue. Even as the effort in New York City has added more than 100 new worker-owners a year, these are still small numbers in the context of a city population that is close to 8.4 million people. A few years ago, a report by DAWI and the Oakland, California-based Project Equity highlighted three challenges : “Build Member Skills and Capacity within worker co-ops, especially the 50 percent that were formed in the past ten years.” “Increase the quantity and diversity of patient capital available as Financing for NYC worker cooperatives and Co-op Developers.” “Make Cooperative Education and Business Supports available through educational institutions, community programs, and city agencies.” For its part, the city’s most recent report noted that the worker co-ops that it had surveyed had reported problems, despite city efforts, in being successful in winning city procurement contracts. In response, the city recommends stepped-up efforts to assist co-ops with language translation, with assisting co-ops obtain certification as women and/or people-of-color-owned businesses, and with accessing city bond and financing programs. In thinking about policy, it is also important to consider that it often helps to focus co-op development in industries where they have been most effective. Generally, as Melissa Hoover, who directs DAWI, pointed out last year, worker co-ops often do best in businesses that are “value-driven” and rely on teamwork. Co-ops in home healthcare and childcare are two prominent examples of this. As Hoover put it last year , “If there’s something that says we should do this in a humane or human-centered way, [people] often come to cooperatives because it enacts their values across-the-board and it dovetails with the work they’re trying to do.”  What if a nonprofit wrote a report and city policy actually changed as a result? Truth is, reports by nonprofits that advocate policy changes are written all the time, but most, even when full of good policy ideas, gather electronic dust.

How to Help Homeless Families: Permanent Housing Posted on June 30, 2017 by Jacquelyn Simone With 15,328 families – including 23,000 children – sleeping in NYC shelters tonight, many New Yorkers and organizations have endeavored to understand how we arrived at such a crisis, as well as how to reverse the trend. In the past few weeks, the Family Homelessness Task Force and The Bassuk Center have released reports in response to Mayor de Blasio’s own report, Turning the Tide on Homelessness , including recommendations about how to address family homelessness. While the Family Homelessness Task Force report contains several important recommendations to prevent homelessness, improve shelter conditions, and help families maintain housing after they leave shelter, it missed the opportunity to make the case for an accelerated, more aggressive housing plan needed to substantially reduce the shelter census. The Bassuk Center report failed to grasp the fundamental causes of record family homelessness in NYC: The revolving door that resulted from the flawed, short-term rent subsidies known as the Advantage program, and the “ lost decade ” when the City denied homeless families priority access to permanent housing placements. The Bassuk report attributes the rate of return to shelters to a perceived lack of social services in NYC shelters, rather than to the dearth of affordable housing and the flaws of the Advantage rent subsidy program. In 2005, the Bloomberg administration made a devastating policy choice when it ended all permanent housing placements for homeless families and instituted a series of flawed, time-limited housing subsidy programs, the last of which was called Advantage. The program abruptly ended in 2011 when the State eliminated its share of the funding and the City cancelled it. With the end of Advantage, for the first time in NYC history, there was no way for families to exit the shelter system. An astonishing 63 percent of families who moved into housing with Advantage subsidies (and who did not transition to a permanent rent subsidy) ultimately returned to the shelter system. Over 10,900 families became homeless again as a result of this policy failure: A huge revolving door that fueled the massive increase in family homelessness between 2011 and 2014. The result of these extremely flawed policy decisions was a veritable “lost decade” – a period between 2006 and 2014 in which on average 3,548 fewer homeless families per year received stable housing placements, resulting in an accumulated deficit of 31,935 fewer Federal housing placements before the de Blasio administration reinstated the permanent housing priority for homeless families. Predictably, in the absence of any way for families to secure permanent housing, the shelter census ballooned and the number of families cycling through the system skyrocketed during that time. The Coalition examined this lost decade and reiterated the need to make up for the deficit in both a January 2017 briefing paper and in our State of the Homeless 2017 report . While arguments can be made for improving the conditions and services in shelters, it is flawed logic to attribute recidivism principally to the lack of shelter services rather than to the structural flaws of the Advantage program and the absolute lack of permanent housing placements during Bloomberg’s latter terms. In order to appreciably reduce the number of homeless families, we must bring the City’s permanent housing response to homelessness to a scale that matches the record need and compensates for the accumulated deficit in housing placements that arose during the “lost decade.” Specifically, the City must increase stable housing placements in NYCHA and HPD to 5,500 per year for families, as well as 5,000 rent subsidies and supported placements for single adults, and create a new capital development program to finance construction of at least an additional 10,000 units of affordable housing for homeless households over the next five years. In order to alleviate the suffering of the near-record number of homeless families, it is imperative that the City commit to housing solutions that will enable these men, women, and children to move out of shelters and into homes of their own. If you agree that housing is the answer to homelessness, please sign our petition calling on Mayor de Blasio to increase the number of public housing placements for homeless families from 1,500 per year to at least 3,000.

Andrew Seng for The New York Times By Winnie Hu and Nate Schweber Published July 15, 2020 Updated July 28, 2020 Governors Island, a 172-acre oasis in the middle of New York Harbor, has become one of New York’s City’s most popular summer playgrounds with hammocks, biking and spectacular water views. But the island’s managers want it to be a greater resource for those who need it the most, especially during the pandemic — poor and nonwhite New Yorkers who often lack parks in their neighborhoods. So the island, which reopens on Wednesday, has for the first time adopted a ticketing system aimed at prioritizing those parkgoers while sharply reducing the number of overall visitors to ensure social distancing. “Our goal this year is really to make sure New Yorkers in need are able to access the island,” said Clare Newman, the president and chief executive of the Trust for Governors Island, which manages the park. The coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the poor and people of color the hardest, has laid bare another glaring inequity: park access. In a city with some of the most famous green spaces in the world, many low-income New Yorkers live in virtual park deserts and are largely shut out of a sprawling network of more than 2,300 parks that has become more important than ever for physical and mental well being.

So the island, which reopens on Wednesday, has for the first time adopted a ticketing system aimed at prioritizing those parkgoers while sharply reducing the number of overall visitors to ensure social distancing. “Our goal this year is really to make sure New Yorkers in need are able to access the island,” said Clare Newman, the president and chief executive of the Trust for Governors Island, which manages the park. The coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the poor and people of color the hardest, has laid bare another glaring inequity: park access. In a city with some of the most famous green spaces in the world, many low-income New Yorkers live in virtual park deserts and are largely shut out of a sprawling network of more than 2,300 parks that has become more important than ever for physical and mental well being.

How will New York decarbonize its famous skyline? Justin Gerdes Justin Gerdes April 23, 2020  Justin Gerdes Contributing Writer Greentech Media 8 8 Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of the passage of perhaps the most ambitious law ever adopted by a U.S. city to reduce planet-warming emissions from buildings. Local Law 97, one of 10 bills in the sweeping Climate Mobilization Act , requires New York City’s 50,000 largest buildings to reduce their carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. Owners of noncompliant buildings face the prospect of multimillion-dollar annual fines beginning in 2024. When the legislation passed, progressives on the New York City Council called the package of bills “the largest single carbon-reduction effort that any city, anywhere, has ever put forward.” With New York sheltering in place and the city’s office buildings largely empty of workers, electricity demand in New York City has declined by as much as 18 percent compared to typical levels. When life returns to some semblance of normal and electricity demand rebounds, the first emissions compliance deadline still looms for New York City’s building owners. Greentech Media recently checked in with some key members of New York City’s buildings community to get an update on the implementation of Local Law 97 and how building owners are preparing to comply with the law. Building energy audits: Little more than a good start Local Law 97 is not New York City’s first attempt to tackle emissions from buildings, which are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. 2009's Greener, Greater Buildings Plan included requirements for energy-use data reporting, regular energy audits and retro-commissioning, and lighting upgrades. But the impact has been modest. Researchers at NYU’s Marron Institute recently published a review of 2011 to 2016 data for 4,000 buildings finding that the city’s mandatory energy audits resulted in energy use reductions of 2.5 percent for multifamily residential buildings and 4.9 percent for office buildings. “Mandatory audits, by themselves, create an insufficient incentive to invest in energy efficiency at the scale needed to meet citywide carbon-reduction goals,” wrote the co-authors. In an interview with Greentech Media, John Mandyck, CEO of the nonprofit Urban Green Council, agreed. “The energy audits were meant to raise awareness and draw attention to the opportunities for energy efficiency. They weren’t by design a mandate to do upgrades.” The building provisions in the Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 are much more aggressive. Under Local Law 97, buildings larger than 25,000 square feet are required to meet emissions caps beginning in 2024. The 50,000 covered buildings — out of 1 million total buildings in New York City — account for about 60 percent of both the city’s floor area and building emissions. Rent-controlled units, affordable housing and houses of worship are sent down a separate compliance path with a required list of some 60 prescriptive measures such as LED lighting, control valves for radiators and leak sealing. Twenty percent of buildings subject to the emissions cap may be out of compliance in 2024, and up to 75 percent when the cap tightens in 2030. “The policy intention is the worst-emitting 20 percent of the buildings have to act first,” said Mandyck. Cap and trade for buildings? Among the measures building owners can embrace to stay under the emissions caps are energy retrofits, procurement of renewable power, and, if approved by policymakers, carbon trading. Local Law 97 required that a study be completed by January 2021 on how a cap-and-trade program for buildings could work in New York City. Big fines for noncompliant building owners are set to begin in 2024. (Credit: NYC Mayor's Office) “Cap and trade is not new, but as a policy tool for cities and addressing the emissions of buildings, it is quite revolutionary, and one we think can unlock carbon reductions in a way we haven’t been able to get at in large urban centers,” said Mandyck. Tokyo launched the world’s first cap-and-trade program for buildings in 2010. Urban Green Council, which pushed for the inclusion of the carbon trading study in Local Law 97, launched an initiative in May 2019 with representatives from New York City, Hong Kong, London, Singapore and Toronto to evaluate how carbon trading for buildings could work in each jurisdiction. The Tokyo case study is illustrative, Mandyck said, but New York City’s envisioned system is of an entirely different scale. Tokyo’s program encompasses around 1,000 buildings, compared to 50,000 in New York. Only about 30 trades have been completed to date in Tokyo. New York City lawmakers will ultimately decide the fate of any cap-and-trade system. “Presuming there is a positive determination that carbon-trading can and should work in New York, it will then require legislation by our city council to actually enact the measure,” said Mandyck. Multimillion-dollar penalties Unsurprisingly, building owners haven’t universally embraced Local Law 97. Some were displeased about the classes of buildings exempted from the emissions cap. And then there are the looming financial penalties. Building owners face fines of $268 per ton of emissions above their designated cap beginning in 2024. Fines could reach as high as $5 million annually for individual buildings. “You can say, ‘OK, well, that’s fine. They choose not to comply. They have to pay a big fine,” said Mandyck. “Building owners can pay fines, but that doesn’t get us the carbon reduction that we need.” Even some LEED Platinum-rated buildings will have a hard time complying with the law. A building can be highly energy-efficient but still consume a lot of energy if it happens to host a data center or trading floor. That reality complicates the picture for any potential carbon-cap system. “A carbon cap is a simple policy tool, but it is a blunt policy instrument, in the sense that it is blind to what’s happening inside the building. You want more density, not less density,” said Mandyck. PACE financing program delayed by COVID-19 Building owners can avoid fines and stay under their emissions caps by investing in energy efficiency and clean energy. The Climate Mobilization Act included a provision authorizing the establishment of property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing in New York City. Building owners can use PACE financing to avoid the upfront costs to install energy-saving equipment or onsite renewable energy. Loans are paid back over the life of the equipment, usually 20 years or more, via a line item on the building’s property tax bill. The repayment obligation is tied to the building, not the owner. “PACE is a big element in the financing puzzle,” said Mandyck. “There’s a big appetite to learn more about it and how it can work. It is a unique and lower-cost financing mechanism to finance these upgrades, with the added benefit that the loans and financing stays with the building.” But the coronavirus outbreak may slow the rollout of PACE financing. The nonprofit New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC), which administers the commercial PACE program, had planned to begin accepting PACE loan applications in early 2020. “This process has been delayed for a variety of reasons, but most recently because of the COVID-19 crisis,” NYCEEC co-CEO Fred Lee told GTM in an email. The city must still issue draft rules for public comment before the PACE program rules can be finalized. Enormous opportunity for building retrofits An analysis published by Urban Green Council in June 2019 found that if all 50,000 covered buildings opted for efficiency upgrades to meet the carbon caps, it would create an energy retrofit market opportunity as large as $24.3 billion in New York City through 2030. In an interview, Richard Yancey, executive director of the nonprofit Building Energy Exchange, said closure of a loophole in the state code that had enabled partial renovations to avoid compliance with the energy code should raise the floor on energy performance. “Building owners are seeing dramatic savings from tenant retrofits — upward of 30 percent energy savings,” Yancey said. “Just by bringing those tenant spaces up to current code, and maybe even going a little further, they are seeing some pretty dramatic energy savings to their overall buildings.” Because such a large share of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions come from space and water heating systems that run on fossil fuels — more than 40 percent, according to Urban Green Council — replacing oil- and gas-burning boilers and furnaces with electric heat pumps would help building owners meet their carbon targets. The challenge of bringing renewable power into NYC More difficult, at least for now, is the option to procure enough renewable electricity to offset a building’s emissions. Local Law 97 allows building owners to meet up to 100 percent of their compliance obligations by buying renewable power. But that electricity must feed directly into the New York City grid. The proposed Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line would carry hydropower from Quebec south to New York City. And by the mid-2020s, electricity from wind farms offshore Long Island should begin replacing zero-carbon power from the soon-to-be-shuttered Indian Point nuclear power plant. If policymakers decide to establish a cap-and-trade program, buildings with emissions below their cap will be able to sell credits to their peers, creating a revenue stream that could be invested in additional energy-saving or clean energy projects. Urgent need to educate building owners Work at NYC’s Department of Buildings to implement Local Law 97 is ongoing. A Climate Advisory Board met for the first time in December 2019. On April 9, the department announced eight new working groups, comprising experts in areas such as building technologies, carbon accounting, economics and communications, will meet for the first time in May. The advisory bodies are to deliver recommendations to the mayor and city council by January 1, 2023. One year after the passage of Local Law 97, there is still much work to be done to engage and educate building owners. “There’s a broad group of people who, quite frankly, still don’t really know what this is,” said Yancey. “A lot of the real estate community — not all of them, but quite a few of them — don’t do long-term planning.” “2024: it’s not right around the corner, so it’s not an immediate concern for them. Even though it is right around the corner," he said. Organizations like Building Energy Exchange and NYC Retrofit Accelerator are educating building professionals on Climate Mobilization Act compliance and how to make their buildings more energy-efficient. The mayor’s office recently committed more than $30 million to ensure that NYC Retrofit Accelerator can provide free technical assistance to any building larger than 25,000 square feet. “As more of these projects are done, they’ll become less expensive for more people to do it,” said Yancey. “Equipment will become less expensive and more available, and expertise will start to get assimilated by the workforce. I remain optimistic we’ll be able to meet these goals and move this all forward.” Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of the passage of perhaps the most ambitious law ever adopted by a U.S. city to reduce planet-warming emissions from buildings. Local Law 97, one of 10 bills in the sweeping Climate Mobilization Act , requires New York City’s 50,000 largest buildings to reduce their carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050.

Twenty percent of buildings subject to the emissions cap may be out of compliance in 2024, and up to 75 percent when the cap tightens in 2030. “The policy intention is the worst-emitting 20 percent of the buildings have to act first,” said Mandyck. Cap and trade for buildings? Among the measures building owners can embrace to stay under the emissions caps are energy retrofits, procurement of renewable power, and, if approved by policymakers, carbon trading. Local Law 97 required that a study be completed by January 2021 on how a cap-and-trade program for buildings could work in New York City. Big fines for noncompliant building owners are set to begin in 2024. (Credit: NYC Mayor's Office) “Cap and trade is not new, but as a policy tool for cities and addressing the emissions of buildings, it is quite revolutionary, and one we think can unlock carbon reductions in a way we haven’t been able to get at in large urban centers,” said Mandyck. Tokyo launched the world’s first cap-and-trade program for buildings in 2010. Urban Green Council, which pushed for the inclusion of the carbon trading study in Local Law 97, launched an initiative in May 2019 with representatives from New York City, Hong Kong, London, Singapore and Toronto to evaluate how carbon trading for buildings could work in each jurisdiction. The Tokyo case study is illustrative, Mandyck said, but New York City’s envisioned system is of an entirely different scale. Tokyo’s program encompasses around 1,000 buildings, compared to 50,000 in New York. Only about 30 trades have been completed to date in Tokyo. New York City lawmakers will ultimately decide the fate of any cap-and-trade system. “Presuming there is a positive determination that carbon-trading can and should work in New York, it will then require legislation by our city council to actually enact the measure,” said Mandyck. Multimillion-dollar penalties Unsurprisingly, building owners haven’t universally embraced Local Law 97. Some were displeased about the classes of buildings exempted from the emissions cap. And then there are the looming financial penalties. Building owners face fines of $268 per ton of emissions above their designated cap beginning in 2024. Fines could reach as high as $5 million annually for individual buildings. “You can say, ‘OK, well, that’s fine. They choose not to comply. They have to pay a big fine,” said Mandyck. “Building owners can pay fines, but that doesn’t get us the carbon reduction that we need.” Even some LEED Platinum-rated buildings will have a hard time complying with the law. A building can be highly energy-efficient but still consume a lot of energy if it happens to host a data center or trading floor. That reality complicates the picture for any potential carbon-cap system. “A carbon cap is a simple policy tool, but it is a blunt policy instrument, in the sense that it is blind to what’s happening inside the building. You want more density, not less density,” said Mandyck. PACE financing program delayed by COVID-19 Building owners can avoid fines and stay under their emissions caps by investing in energy efficiency and clean energy. The Climate Mobilization Act included a provision authorizing the establishment of property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing in New York City. Building owners can use PACE financing to avoid the upfront costs to install energy-saving equipment or onsite renewable energy. Loans are paid back over the life of the equipment, usually 20 years or more, via a line item on the building’s property tax bill. The repayment obligation is tied to the building, not the owner. “PACE is a big element in the financing puzzle,” said Mandyck. “There’s a big appetite to learn more about it and how it can work. It is a unique and lower-cost financing mechanism to finance these upgrades, with the added benefit that the loans and financing stays with the building.” But the coronavirus outbreak may slow the rollout of PACE financing. The nonprofit New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC), which administers the commercial PACE program, had planned to begin accepting PACE loan applications in early 2020. “This process has been delayed for a variety of reasons, but most recently because of the COVID-19 crisis,” NYCEEC co-CEO Fred Lee told GTM in an email. The city must still issue draft rules for public comment before the PACE program rules can be finalized. Enormous opportunity for building retrofits An analysis published by Urban Green Council in June 2019 found that if all 50,000 covered buildings opted for efficiency upgrades to meet the carbon caps, it would create an energy retrofit market opportunity as large as $24.3 billion in New York City through 2030. In an interview, Richard Yancey, executive director of the nonprofit Building Energy Exchange, said closure of a loophole in the state code that had enabled partial renovations to avoid compliance with the energy code should raise the floor on energy performance. “Building owners are seeing dramatic savings from tenant retrofits — upward of 30 percent energy savings,” Yancey said. “Just by bringing those tenant spaces up to current code, and maybe even going a little further, they are seeing some pretty dramatic energy savings to their overall buildings.” Because such a large share of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions come from space and water heating systems that run on fossil fuels — more than 40 percent, according to Urban Green Council — replacing oil- and gas-burning boilers and furnaces with electric heat pumps would help building owners meet their carbon targets. The challenge of bringing renewable power into NYC More difficult, at least for now, is the option to procure enough renewable electricity to offset a building’s emissions. Local Law 97 allows building owners to meet up to 100 percent of their compliance obligations by buying renewable power. But that electricity must feed directly into the New York City grid. The proposed Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line would carry hydropower from Quebec south to New York City. And by the mid-2020s, electricity from wind farms offshore Long Island should begin replacing zero-carbon power from the soon-to-be-shuttered Indian Point nuclear power plant. If policymakers decide to establish a cap-and-trade program, buildings with emissions below their cap will be able to sell credits to their peers, creating a revenue stream that could be invested in additional energy-saving or clean energy projects. Urgent need to educate building owners Work at NYC’s Department of Buildings to implement Local Law 97 is ongoing. A Climate Advisory Board met for the first time in December 2019. On April 9, the department announced eight new working groups, comprising experts in areas such as building technologies, carbon accounting, economics and communications, will meet for the first time in May. The advisory bodies are to deliver recommendations to the mayor and city council by January 1, 2023. One year after the passage of Local Law 97, there is still much work to be done to engage and educate building owners. “There’s a broad group of people who, quite frankly, still don’t really know what this is,” said Yancey. “A lot of the real estate community — not all of them, but quite a few of them — don’t do long-term planning.” “2024: it’s not right around the corner, so it’s not an immediate concern for them. Even though it is right around the corner," he said. Organizations like Building Energy Exchange and NYC Retrofit Accelerator are educating building professionals on Climate Mobilization Act compliance and how to make their buildings more energy-efficient. The mayor’s office recently committed more than $30 million to ensure that NYC Retrofit Accelerator can provide free technical assistance to any building larger than 25,000 square feet. “As more of these projects are done, they’ll become less expensive for more people to do it,” said Yancey. “Equipment will become less expensive and more available, and expertise will start to get assimilated by the workforce. I remain optimistic we’ll be able to meet these goals and move this all forward.” Local Law 97, one of 10 bills in the sweeping Climate Mobilization Act , requires New York City’s 50,000 largest buildings to reduce their carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. Owners of noncompliant buildings face the prospect of multimillion-dollar annual fines beginning in 2024. When the legislation passed, progressives on the New York City Council called the package of bills “the largest single carbon-reduction effort that any city, anywhere, has ever put forward.” With New York sheltering in place and the city’s office buildings largely empty of workers, electricity demand in New York City has declined by as much as 18 percent compared to typical levels. When life returns to some semblance of normal and electricity demand rebounds, the first emissions compliance deadline still looms for New York City’s building owners. Greentech Media recently checked in with some key members of New York City’s buildings community to get an update on the implementation of Local Law 97 and how building owners are preparing to comply with the law. Building energy audits: Little more than a good start Local Law 97 is not New York City’s first attempt to tackle emissions from buildings, which are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. 2009's Greener, Greater Buildings Plan included requirements for energy-use data reporting, regular energy audits and retro-commissioning, and lighting upgrades. But the impact has been modest. Researchers at NYU’s Marron Institute recently published a review of 2011 to 2016 data for 4,000 buildings finding that the city’s mandatory energy audits resulted in energy use reductions of 2.5 percent for multifamily residential buildings and 4.9 percent for office buildings. “Mandatory audits, by themselves, create an insufficient incentive to invest in energy efficiency at the scale needed to meet citywide carbon-reduction goals,” wrote the co-authors. In an interview with Greentech Media, John Mandyck, CEO of the nonprofit Urban Green Council, agreed. “The energy audits were meant to raise awareness and draw attention to the opportunities for energy efficiency. They weren’t by design a mandate to do upgrades.” The building provisions in the Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 are much more aggressive. Under Local Law 97, buildings larger than 25,000 square feet are required to meet emissions caps beginning in 2024. The 50,000 covered buildings — out of 1 million total buildings in New York City — account for about 60 percent of both the city’s floor area and building emissions. Rent-controlled units, affordable housing and houses of worship are sent down a separate compliance path with a required list of some 60 prescriptive measures such as LED lighting, control valves for radiators and leak sealing.

Since the national uprisings of 2020 fueled by the police killing of George Floyd, Communities United for Police Reform has led a historic coalition of local and national organizations united to demand #NYCBudgetJustice – a call for real public safety through investment in infrastructure and community safety solutions and reducing the reliance on police and criminalization. Mayor Eric Adams FY25 Executive Budget is not a financial plan that will increase real health and safety for New Yorkers in the upcoming year. The FY25 Budget includes significant staffing and budget cuts to crucial agencies, services, and infrastructure – cuts that undermine the foundation of safe and thriving cities. At the same time, Mayor Eric Adams has virtually fully restored the staffing and budget of the NYPD [a] and the FY25 Executive Budget includes $11.9 billion dollars in police spending. [b] We are especially concerned that increases to the size and scope of the NYPD are being proposed at a time when NYPD overspending, misconduct, and secrecy is at an all-time high. We can’t continue to reward the NYPD by expanding police spending while gutting key NYC programs that create the ecosystem of non-police safety infrastructure for our communities. We are demanding that the following changes be incorporated into the FY25 Adopted Budget so that New Yorkers can have access to the services and support they need and  the NYPD is held accountable for their record of violence, misinformation, overspending, and their refusal to fire officers who unjustly kill, brutalize, and violate the rights of New Yorkers. Areas that should be considered for cuts in the NYPD budget to make monies available for other agencies include: Cut the NYPD’s press/communications budget by at least 50%, including Deputy Commissioner of Public Information and other NYPD press/communications infrastructure and programs. Public resources should not be used to spread misinformation, and the millions of dollars being spent by the NYPD public relations spin team should be cut and re-invested to close critical gaps. When accounting for full cost of staffing of DCPI, social media management and other contracts, we estimate that the full cost of NYPD press and communications is well over $10 million dollars. [i] Remove NYPD from mental health response. New Yorkers need mental health care, not increased criminalization. NYPD Co-Response Teams should be eliminated, and this money should be moved into crisis response teams that do not include police officers and community-based mental health services and programs that can provide mental health crisis prevention, response and post-crisis services. We estimate that the NYPD Uniform costs of NYPD Mental Health Co-Response teams is approximately $5.6 million dollars. [ii] Freeze hiring of school police and cut funding for remaining vacant school positions. Mayor Eric Adams is proposing hiring 574 school police officers next year in the FY25 Executive Budget.[iii] It was also recently announced that an additional 400 school police positions [iv] are being proposed for the FY25 Adopted budget, meaning close to 1000 new school police officers in schools next year.  The city should be taking the opposite approach, cutting school cop vacancies, freezing hiring, and moving at least $98 million dollars [v] to close needed gaps in services and support for students. Students need restorative justice, mental health, other non-police schools’ staff and practices that help students learn and thrive, not cops. Disband the Strategic Response Group (SRG) Adams is proposing an increase in funding next year for this notoriously abusive unit [vi] .  The SRG should be disbanded, and their hyper-aggressive escalating tactics should be eliminated. Militarized forces that target protesters for exercising their first amendment rights do not belong in our communities or in our streets, we must disband the SRG and reinvest $145 million [vii] to serve, not harm New Yorkers. Block attempts to add 1,200 additional officers in FY25 [viii], and instead invest those monies to fund help keep jobs in schools, mental health programs, libraries, composting, and non-police anti-violence programs. The NYPD should not be allowed to add an additional 1,200 new recruits in FY25 while staffing from other critical agencies and programs are being cut. These officers would add $62 million dollars to the NYPD expense budget and at least an additional $62 [ix] million in fringe and pension costs for FY2 for a total of $124 million dollars that can be reinvested. Stop the Creation of Cop City NYC! Reject Mayor Eric Adams plan to spend $225 million on a mega-police training facility in Queens. This capital project will consolidate training for the NYPD and 17 other city agencies that have enforcement arms. Adams' Cop City project will increase the influence and power of the NYPD and mold the enforcement arms of other city agencies to more closely follow NYPD protocols and practices. This is a dangerous expansion of policing and enforcement and will result in increased criminalization of New Yorkers.  Featured News For immediate release: June 30, 2024 CPR Responds to FY25 NYC Budget Vote Following the budget vote today, Communities United for Police Reform (CPR) released the following statement from NYC Budget Justice Coalition spokesperson, Loyda Colón (they/them), Executive Director of the Justice Committee. “The Council and New Yorkers should be commended for fighting Mayor Adam's monstrous cuts and restoring funding to some important safety infrastructure and services, such as libraries, arts and culture and affordable housing. However, it’s deeply concerning that the budget will maintain a record-breaking $12B in unchecked police spending in FY25 when redirecting some of the NYPD's bloated budget could have fully restored and baselined key city programs.

When crises hit, cash transfers are a part of the package of policies that governments deploy to ameliorate their economic effects. Whether it’s about refugees, economic downturns, or natural disasters, countries have used cash extensively . Empirical evidence shows that cash transfers are generally spent judiciously, they can save lives and, if they are designed well, can help people get permanently out of poverty. But there is more to it. More recently, it has become clear that cash injections can spark wider knock-on benefits. In Africa, the provision of $1 in such programs generated between $1.27 and $2.60 in local economies . In the United States, a dollar’s worth of SNAP, a quasi-cash scheme, leads to $1.79 in economic gains . And even amid the EU’s recession a decade ago , every cash euro generated 85 euro cents in economic activity. The question is: Could cash transfers help offset some of the economic damage being wrought by COVID-19? It’s not a hypothetical question. In responding to the novel coronavirus, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and China are anticipating, expanding, and increasing payments of their flagship cash programs. And so is the U.K . Because of the universal nature of the virus, some countries are considering universal transfers. These include the provision of cash to everyone with no strings attached, namely universal basic income (UBI)—the subject of our new book . One tool, many objectives Traditionally, UBI is framed around three different goals: (1) countering possible job losses from automation , including at-risk occupations like truck drivers; (2) strengthening social contracts and trust in government by redistributing oil revenues a la Alaska ; and (3) acting as a deliberate poverty-reduction instrument . Each of these objectives has different implications for how UBI has to be communicated to the public, how it is perceived and supported societally, and how it is designed. For example, the amount of cash provided as a token for social contracts may hardly be adequate to make a dent in poverty. Trade-offs and expectations need to be managed. The COVID-19 epidemic is now presenting policymakers an opportunity to consider a new approach to UBI—a one-off cash transfer to stimulate consumer demand. This could be implemented as monetary levers at the disposal of central banks, or as part of fiscal packages rolled out by ministries of finance. There are precedents: Kuwait had such one-off transfers in 2011, while Australia did a similar injection in 2009. Policymakers have taken note and are now considering one-off cash transfers as a serious policy option. In fact, Hong Kong has already announced that it will reach its 7 million adult residents with a one-off payment, and the European Union is pondering doing so as it “turns every stone.” 5 lessons Previous experiences with UBI and UBI-like interventions provide five lessons. They have to do with inflation risks, strains on delivery systems, communication, synchronization with other safety nets, and using temporary crises to make permanent changes. One-off transfers in Kuwait and Australia, as well as regular UBI payments in Mongolia , did not seem to generate significant inflation. This is because goods and services kept being supplied by private markets and public agencies and enterprises. But this should not be taken as a given during crises. The strength of delivery systems is key. If the movements of people are constrained (e.g., because of quarantines), massive pressure may be exerted on digital and online payments, the development of which lies at the heart of India’s “quasi-UBI” programs . Making sure that those systems are robust would be a priority during pandemics. The importance of a sound communication strategy around a UBI scheme cannot be overstated. UBI comes with competing narratives and expectations, putting a premium on clarity about its purpose, design, and eligibility requirements. This is even more important at times when people are prone to panic. If considered, a UBI program should fit within the ecosystem of existing schemes. A UBI could ensure rapid and widespread coverage, but it may lack nuance in addressing specific vulnerabilities (e.g., providing care to the elderly and other vulnerable groups such as children). And if the crises are prolonged or deep, the burden of supporting people will rest on existing safety nets. Making sure that they are scalable, tailored, and well-funded is key. Crises tend to shed light on the gaps in social protection systems. The experience in high-income economies, as well as in countries such as Indonesia, Egypt, Lebanon, and Ethiopia, shows that crises are often precious junctions for enacting long-term improvements . UBI may be the way to plug the hole but, equally possibly, it may not be the best to do so. In fighting COVID-19, there might well be a role for developing this new form of one-off cash transfers. Hopefully cross-country learning on cash transfers will spread faster than the virus.

Nov. 10, 2020 Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times Share full article By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom. For generations, affordable housing has been built in lower-income neighborhoods. Across the United States for more than a half century, that practice deepened residential segregation and income inequality. In New York City alone, more than 50,000 new affordable housing units have been built or financed since 2014, according to city officials, the overwhelming majority in lower-income neighborhoods, like East New York. Now, though, the city is ready to take a different approach. One promising plan would rezone SoHo, bringing thousands of new apartments to the cobblestone-lined area of Lower Manhattan that makes up one of the wealthiest areas of the city. Image Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times Image Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times Of the roughly 3,200 new apartments, at least 25 percent of the housing will be set aside for lower income New Yorkers as part of the city’s affordable housing program, according to city officials. That number can and should be negotiated upward over the coming months. Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the plan, as do several of the candidates vying to succeed him. That’s crucial since the City Council isn’t likely to vote on the rezoning until next year, and the political capital of Mr. de Blasio, who is term-limited, is waning. Similar rezonings are being considered at the southern tip of Manhattan and in Gowanus, a once industrial Brooklyn neighborhood that gentrified years ago. The proposal in southern Manhattan, in the Seaport area, would smartly build new housing, including affordable housing, on a site that is currently used as a parking lot. City officials can serve New York by securing more affordable housing at lower rents from developers, since the market-rate apartments will generate a far greater profit than in lower-income areas.

In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression. This page provides key statistics and some of the main factors causing modern mass homelessness. You can download these key facts he r e . Also see: How many people are homeless in NYC altogether? The Basic Facts: In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s . In January 2025, 120,513 people slept each night in NYC shelters. Thousands more (there is no reliable number, as the annual HOPE estimate is deeply flawed) slept unsheltered in public spaces, and more than 200,000 people slept temporarily doubled-up in the homes of others. Thus, it can be estimated that more than 350,000 people were without homes in NYC in January 2025. In January 2025, 70 percent of those in shelters were members of homeless families , including 41,615 children . That month, 35,651 single adults slept in shelters. Thirty-nine percent of those in shelters, or 46,418 individuals, were New Arrivals.* More than 146,000 NYC schoolchildren experienced homelessness at some point during the 2023–2024 school year, representing one in eight children attending city schools . The primary reason people in NYC become homeless is the lack of affordable housing . Surveys of homeless families have identified the following major immediate, triggering causes of homelessness in NYC: eviction; doubled-up or severely overcrowded housing; domestic violence; job loss; and hazardous housing conditions . Between 1996 and 2017, NYC lost 1.1 million units of affordable housing . The most recent Housing Vacancy Survey indicates a vacancy rate of less than one percent for affordable apartments in NYC. Families entering shelters (excluding New Arrivals) predominantly come from a few clustered zip codes in the poorest neighborhoods in NYC. However, every community district in NYC contributes to the ongoing homelessness crisis . Compared to homeless families, homeless single adults have higher rates of serious mental illness, substance use disorders, and other severe health problems . There is not yet reliable data on such rates New Arrivals in the shelter system. Of the longer-term New Yorkers (non-New Arrivals) sleeping in the DHS shelters, 43 percent of families with children, 65 percent of single adults, and 75 percent of families without minor children have a disability requiring a facility-related accommodation. The majority of unsheltered homeless individuals are people living with a mental illness or other severe health problems . Black and Hispanic/Latinx New Yorkers are disproportionately affected by homelessness . Approximately 56 percent of heads of household in shelters are Black, 32 percent are Hispanic/Latinx, 7 percent are White, less than 1 percent are Asian-American or Native American, and 4 percent are of unknown race/ethnicity.  Demographic info on asylum seekers and other new arrivals in shelters has not been provided by the City. In City Fiscal Year 2023, the average length of stay in the DHS shelter system was 412 days for single adults, 437 days for families with children, and 750 days for adult families. New York’s legal Right to Shelter has given more than one million homeless New Yorkers a way off the streets since 1981.

Credit... Emily Kask for The New York Times By Sheryl Gay Stolberg Published June 7, 2020 Updated July 27, 2021 WASHINGTON — When Mike Griffin, a black community organizer in Minneapolis, took to the streets in protest, he was grieving for two black men taken during the turmoil convulsing the country: George Floyd, who died after gasping for air under the knee of a white police officer, and his own godfather, who succumbed to Covid-19. “I’m just as likely to die from a cop as I am from Covid,” he said. In Providence, R.I., graduate students and alumni of color at the Brown University School of Public Health are demanding their professors take a strong stand against police violence — and direct research dollars to study it. And in Baltimore, a city still reckoning with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in police custody, Rajikh Hayes, an activist, said protesters were acutely aware that they were risking exposure to the coronavirus, which is far likelier to kill black people than white people, and of the suffering Covid-19 had caused in their community. “It’s really a simple question: ‘Am I going to let a disease kill me or am I going to let the system — the police?” he said. “And if something is going to take me out when I don’t have a job, which one do I prefer? Folks who don’t have much else to lose — they understand that this system isn’t built for black people. And that’s why people are in the streets.” As protests over police brutality continue to roil cities, this is an extraordinary moment of pain for the nation, especially for black Americans who are bearing the brunt of three crises — police violence, crushing unemployment and the deadliest infectious disease threat in a century — that have laid bare longstanding injustice. Public health experts, activists and lawmakers say the triple threat requires a coordinated response. “These are interrelated crises — the crisis of racism and inequality that is now converging with the crisis of Covid-19,” said Dr. Leana S. Wen, who was Baltimore’s health commissioner when Mr. Gray died, and who testified before Congress on Thursday about racial disparities in the pandemic . “There is no playbook for what you do for addressing public health impacts of civil unrest.” The precise toll that the coronavirus has taken on people of color remains unknown; not every state collects data. The Trump administration, under pressure from Congress, announced on Thursday new requirements for states to do so. But an analysis of data from 40 states and the District of Columbia, released last month by the nonpartisan APM Research Lab, found black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites, Latinos or Asian-Americans to die from the coronavirus. In some states, the disparity is much greater. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Join today Politics Bryan Stevenson on how America can heal A conversation about truth and reconciliation in the US. by Ezra Klein Jul 20, 2020, 1:20 PM UTC Facebook Link Bryan Stevenson stands in front of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, the first memorial dedicated to those terrorized by lynching. Rog and Bee Walker/Equal Justice Initiative What would it take for America to heal? To be the country it claims to be? This is the question that animates Bryan Stevenson’s career. Stevenson is the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a clinical professor at the New York University School of Law, a MacArthur “genius,” and the author of the remarkable book Just Mercy — which was recently turned into a feature film where Stevenson was played by Michael B. Jordan. I admire Stevenson tremendously. He has lived a life dedicated to justice — justice for individuals (some of whom he has rescued from death row) and justice for the society he lives in. He’s one of the fairly few people I’ve found with a vision for how America could find justice on the far shore of its own history. That vision is particularly needed now and so I asked him to return to The Ezra Klein Show to share it. To my delight, he agreed. This conversation is about truth and reconciliation in America — and about whether truth would actually lead to reconciliation in America. It’s about what the process of reckoning with our past sins and present wounds would look and feel and sound like. It’s about what we can learn from countries like Germany and South Africa, that have walked further down this path than we have. And it’s about the country and community that could lie on the other side of that confrontation. An edited transcript from our conversation follows. The full conversation can be heard on The Ezra Klein Show . Ezra Klein What is a healthy relationship for society to have with its own history? Bryan Stevenson Knowing the actual history. If you don’t know your history, you can’t really begin to understand what your obligations are, what your responsibilities are, what you should fear, what you should celebrate, what’s honorable and what’s not honorable. The big problem we have in the United States is that we don’t actually know our history. We don’t know about the centuries of racial injustice. We don’t know about the native genocide. You say “native genocide” and people have no idea what you’re talking about. They think you’re saying something radical. Once you know that history, you begin to think differently about who we are. We got comfortable with creating a Constitution that talks about equality and justice for all, but didn’t apply to millions of Indigenous people who were on this land. And so until you understand that history, you can’t begin thinking about, well, what are your responsibilities now? What are your obligations now? What would it take to recover from that kind of violence, that kind of destruction that we did to millions of Indigenous people? And, of course, that failure to acknowledge that history is what makes us vulnerable to the two-and-a-half centuries of slavery that follow. We’ve invested a lot of time in creating false narratives about slavery, about enslavers, about the South, about the North, about emancipation, about abolitionists — many of whom didn’t believe in slavery but also didn’t believe in racial equality. And the legacy of that is very different than the legacy we’ve been taught. So for me, it begins with honesty. If you’ve done something wrong to someone else and you genuinely don’t know what you’ve done wrong, you’re not going to be able to fully reconcile with that person. You’re not going to be able to adequately apologize. You’re not going to be able to say the things you need to say to create a path toward recovery. You have to know what you did. And once you understand what you did, you can then begin to calibrate all the things that have to happen for you to try to make peace. For you to recover. To create fellowship again. We have committed ourselves in this country to silence about our history, to ignorance about our history, to denying our history. And that’s the first part of this relationship that has to be repaired. We’ve got to be willing now to talk honestly about who we are and how we got here. Ezra Klein A word you used a few times there was “we.” But when we begin having this conversation about our history, the shared national identity that gets taken for granted in other contexts begins to dissolve very fast. After 9/11, or after winning World War II or during an election, people talk about Americans as a “we” no matter when their ancestors got here. They tend to associate themselves with its founding, its lineages, its victories. But then you get into its misdeeds, its injustices, its sins, and the idea there is a “we” here becomes very difficult for people. People say things like, “ Well, I wasn’t here. I didn’t do any of that. My grandparents came here from Ireland in 1942.” How do you deal with the pronouns in this conversation? Who is talking? Who is listening? Who owes what to whom? Bryan Stevenson I think you’re exactly right. There is a tendency when it comes to mistakes, misconduct, abuse, to disassociate yourself from those things while running to embrace every aspect of achievement. “We won the most medals at the United States Olympics.” Well, you didn’t win any medals, but we do invoke ownership. So I believe it’s important for anyone who identifies as an American, as a citizen of this country, to not simply embrace all the things about American history that we think are glorious and wonderful, but to also acknowledge and accept the things about our history that are tragic and devastating. What’s interesting for me, when I look at the experience of African Americans in particular, Black people have been so committed to this country, they’ve been so committed to the identity of an America that is committed to equality and justice. In the 250 years of enslavement in which Black people endured being kidnapped, put in chains, brutalized, mistreated, abused, raped — there was daily humiliation and degradation, the violence of slavery. That kind of abuse and mistreatment finally ends in 1865 after the Civil War, after the ratification of the 13th Amendment. And instead of seeking revenge or retribution or violence against those who had enslaved them, emancipated Black people said, “ We’re going to make peace here. We’re going to make community here. We’re going to commit to education. We’re going to commit to voting. We’re going to become ideal American citizens. ” When you think about all of the brutality and violence and abuse that Black people suffered and they still were willing to live in harmony with those who had abused them, it says something remarkable about the power of “we.” They believed in an America and they got no credit for that. What they got instead was more abuse. There were over 2,000 lynchings between 1865 and 1877. One of the most violent periods in American history. And yet, for 100 years, they still believed enough in the American idea that they would continue finding ways to contribute. You saw those contributions in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. And then when they got back from war, they’d be targeted for violence by white supremacists who feared their American military service might cause them to believe that they were an equal. What Dr. King and Rosa Parks and others do in the 1950s and ’60s is so rooted in a commitment to the American identity. To me, the model that African Americans have established with this country is that even when things are not good we invoke this idea of an American identity. It means that we absolutely have to be willing to acknowledge the things that are harmful, that are injurious in the American South. The entire American South benefited from the institution of slavery — the entire United States did. The rail lines that allowed those companies in the North to become industrialists, the industries that gave rise to all of that growth during the first half of the 20th century — all of it had its roots in this forced labor stolen from Black bodies. We have to understand that to really be honest. There is no way of saying “they did that.” If we’re going to claim American citizenship and American identity, there has to be a willingness to say “we” just like there’s that willingness to say “we” when an American does something great. Ezra Klein In an interview you did at MOMA in 2015, you had this line that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since: “We need to engage everyone in a meaningful conversation about what it would take to cleanse ourselves of the legacy of slavery.” When I first heard that I thought it was obvious. And then I realized that almost every word in that sentence could take a lifetime to unpack. We began with the first word in that sentence: “we.” But let me go to one of the next pieces of it, which is “engage everyone.” The conversations we have in this country, to the extent we have them at all, are polarized and fractured. So how do we engage everyone in a conversation about America’s foundational sins? Bryan Stevenson I think it begins with an understanding of what actually happened. The true evil of American slavery wasn’t involuntary servitude or the forced labor. It wasn’t the bondage. The real evil of slavery was the ideology that we created — that Black people are less deserving, less worthy, less human, less evolved. If you understand that’s the true problem of slavery, then it becomes easier to understand how we don’t really end slavery with the passage of the 13th Amendment. In 1865, my view is that slavery doesn’t end — it just evolves. Because we never deal with the fundamental character that made enslavement so horrific, which is this ideology of white supremacy. Once you understand that, then you can continue to see that legacy play out in the disenfranchisement and exclusion of Black people from jobs in the North and West in the 1950s. When banks don’t give Black people mortgage loans, they don’t help veterans who are Black move into the middle class. You begin to see it in the ’70s and ’80s when we declared this war on drugs and we target Black communities. You see it in the ways in which police violence manifests itself. And once you understand that, you begin to understand that you are implicated in this story. You are implicated in this moment that we live in where the smog created by our history of racial injustice is still in the air and we’re still breathing it in and it’s corrupting our world view, just like it corrupted the world view of people before us. So it does begin with that understanding. Ezra Klein What does that engagement actually look like? What is the structure in which people are pulled into this conversation so they can get to that understanding? Bryan Stevenson I think it’s local. It’s intimate. It’s familial, it’s communal. It’s statewide. It’s nationwide. I think every entity, every institution has to commit to this process of truth-telling. I think it’s really important that people understand that if you’re genuinely engaged and recovering from human rights abuses, you have to commit to truth-telling first. You can’t jump to reconciliation. You can’t jump to reparation or restoration until you tell the truth. Until you know the nature of the injuries, you can’t actually speak to the kind of remedies that are going to be necessary. For me, that’s very immediate. I believe colleges and universities need to have their own truth-telling process to document the ways in which they contributed to the history of racial inequality, the history of white supremacy. If you were a college and university functioning in the first half of the 20th century, there are things you should acknowledge you did to sustain racial inequality. Corporations, banks, insurance companies all played a critical role in allowing racial injustice and white supremacy to prevail throughout the 20th century. You don’t have to go outside of your own institutions. You can begin with your own truth-telling. You can tell your own story about the ways in which you are complicit. For me, that’s got to be the way it works. There are places in the American South that have to address things that were unique to this region. We didn’t allow Black people to vote in many states in the American South for a century. It took blood and violence and federal troops and congressional acts just to give people their right to vote. And there was no shame about denying people their right to vote. The North wins the Civil War and the South wins the narrative war because not only do they not apologize, they actually double down and say what we did by enslaving people and forming this Confederacy was noble and glorious and honorable. And when that’s your mindset, you don’t get to the right place. That didn’t happen when lynching becomes less prominent in the 1950s. It didn’t happen in the 1960s after the passage of the civil rights laws. It hasn’t happened yet. So I want to say to the state of Alabama: Will you reckon with your history of enslavement, your history of lynching, your history of segregation? What are you going to say? What are you going to be reckoned with? In 1965, we should have said: If you’re really sorry about all of this abuse and disenfranchisement, if you really want to do something to recover from a century of disenfranchisement, the state of Alabama ought to say, “We’re going to register every Black person when they turn 18. We no longer want the burden to be on Black people who have been discouraged and abused and turned away and humiliated and threatened for trying to vote. We’re going to take that burden. We’re going to register every Black person.” We’re going to say to the University of Alabama, University of Georgia, and some of these schools that were adamantly opposed to integration, if those universities really want to reckon, then maybe they’re going to say, “ We don’t think Black people who are residents of the state should have to pay tuition. We think we should take that on as a way of recovering, responding to this history of exclusion.” Banks could be thinking very differently about what they owe African Americans in this country when they reckon with the history of exclusion. The military could be thinking about what it owes to Black veterans when it allowed banks and American institutions to turn veterans away because of the color of their skin. Companies have that same responsibility. The government has that same responsibility. But for me, it begins with the truth-telling, because when you start telling the truth, you recognize things. For me, the question is: What is the truth of our institution as it relates to the history of racial inequality? It’s very, very concrete. How do we frame an investigation into the truth of our history? What is the truth of our history? What is our institutions’ role? What is our community’s role in allowing this landscape to be created that is so shattered by racial injustice and white supremacy? Ezra Klein Barbara Lee recently proposed a Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Commission. Do you think that is a model that could work here, and how do you imagine it looking? And for those who don’t know, can you talk about the truth and reconciliation process more generally? Bryan Stevenson There are countries that have engaged in a national effort of truth-telling. We saw that in South Africa after the collapse of apartheid. The truth and reconciliation process there was very powerful. The victims of apartheid had an opportunity to tell their stories. The perpetrators were also required to speak to their role. It was an important process. We’ve seen it in Rwanda, where the victims of the genocide have been invited to give voice to their suffering, their loss. The prisons were filled with perpetrators of that violence and there was a reckoning around it. Obviously, in Germany, we’ve seen a dramatic transformation of that country’s landscape so that you now have stones and symbols and memorials and monuments throughout cities like Berlin. There’s a Holocaust memorial in the center of Berlin. Every student in Germany as an elementary school student is required to go to the Holocaust memorials and learn that history. Police officers are required to study that history. And so it can be effective at the national level. I’m very supportive of Representative Lee’s commission. But I want to caution that the difference between South Africa and Rwanda and Germany and the United States is that there was a transfer of power in each of those countries. Black South Africans took over South Africa once they had the vote — it’s a Black majority country. In Rwanda, the victims of the genocide ultimately regained power through military intervention. So in each case, the parameters of that truth-telling were shaped by people who had been victimized. In Germany, the Nazis lost the war. We wouldn’t see all of that iconography honoring victims of the Holocaust in Berlin had the Nazis prevailed. With that transfer of power, we had the opportunity to do some things that we don’t have in this country. The people who were the perpetrators of so much of this bigotry and violence are still in power. There was no transfer in power after the Civil War, after the era of lynching, even after the civil rights movement. And because of that, it’s going to have to be much more atomized. I think we should have a national truth-telling commission, but that is not going to be an excuse for banks and schools and corporations and industries and police departments and localities from engaging in their own truth-telling. I think we have to try to get people to understand that when we confront this history, we don’t have to fear punishment. I’m a lawyer. I defend people who have done things that are terrible. And I’m persuaded that each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done. Because of that, I want to talk about this history of enslavement and of native genocide and of lynching and segregation, not because I’m interested in punishing America. I want to liberate us. I really do believe there is something better waiting for us. I think there’s something that feels more like freedom. There’s something that feels more like equality. There’s something that feels more like justice that we have yet to experience in this country. And if we are committed to this idea of America, if we believe in this idea of America, then we ought to figure out how we’re going to get to that promise that we have been denied because we have been unwilling to acknowledge the past. That’s the beauty that awaits us if we’re willing to take that step. We opened this memorial that is dedicated to thousands of victims of racial terror lynchings. And for me, it’s been so affirming to see people come into that space. Black and white people, many of them are in tears. Many of them will wrap their arms around the monuments that represent the communities where they are from, a need to see them sobbing. But through that pain, there is beauty that emerges. You begin to see the possibility of restoration. But until we tell the truth, we deny ourselves the opportunity for beauty. Justice can be beautiful. Reconciliation can be beautiful. Repair can be beautiful. It’s powerful to actually experience redemption. And we deny ourselves that when we insist on denying our broken past, our ugly past, our racist past, when we insist on avoiding the truth. And because there hasn’t been a military intervention, because we are not a Black majority in this country, because there isn’t hopefully some war that transitions power, we’re going to have to compel people, call people, push people to see the beauty that comes with truth-telling and personal relationship. You can’t overcome abuse, you can’t overcome violence, you can’t overcome victimization if you’re unwilling to reckon with all that you have suffered. And that’s the only power we possess when it comes to pushing this country. Nothing good has ever come from things that are easy. To do hard things, you gotta confront them. And so there’s no way forward at this moment in our history that doesn’t involve some discomfort and doesn’t involve some inconvenience. And you just have to find the capacity and the courage to embrace that.

Advertiser Content From This is the title for the native ad Politics Politics Bryan Stevenson on how America can heal A conversation about truth and reconciliation in the US. by Ezra Klein by Ezra Klein  Ezra Klein Jul 20, 2020, 1:20 PM UTC Facebook Link Facebook Link What would it take for America to heal? To be the country it claims to be? This is the question that animates Bryan Stevenson’s career. Stevenson is the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a clinical professor at the New York University School of Law, a MacArthur “genius,” and the author of the remarkable book Just Mercy — which was recently turned into a feature film where Stevenson was played by Michael B. Jordan. I admire Stevenson tremendously. He has lived a life dedicated to justice — justice for individuals (some of whom he has rescued from death row) and justice for the society he lives in. He’s one of the fairly few people I’ve found with a vision for how America could find justice on the far shore of its own history. That vision is particularly needed now and so I asked him to return to The Ezra Klein Show to share it. To my delight, he agreed. This conversation is about truth and reconciliation in America — and about whether truth would actually lead to reconciliation in America. It’s about what the process of reckoning with our past sins and present wounds would look and feel and sound like. It’s about what we can learn from countries like Germany and South Africa, that have walked further down this path than we have. And it’s about the country and community that could lie on the other side of that confrontation. An edited transcript from our conversation follows. The full conversation can be heard on The Ezra Klein Show . Ezra Klein What is a healthy relationship for society to have with its own history? Bryan Stevenson Knowing the actual history. If you don’t know your history, you can’t really begin to understand what your obligations are, what your responsibilities are, what you should fear, what you should celebrate, what’s honorable and what’s not honorable. The big problem we have in the United States is that we don’t actually know our history. We don’t know about the centuries of racial injustice. We don’t know about the native genocide. You say “native genocide” and people have no idea what you’re talking about. They think you’re saying something radical. Once you know that history, you begin to think differently about who we are. We got comfortable with creating a Constitution that talks about equality and justice for all, but didn’t apply to millions of Indigenous people who were on this land. And so until you understand that history, you can’t begin thinking about, well, what are your responsibilities now? What are your obligations now? What would it take to recover from that kind of violence, that kind of destruction that we did to millions of Indigenous people? And, of course, that failure to acknowledge that history is what makes us vulnerable to the two-and-a-half centuries of slavery that follow. We’ve invested a lot of time in creating false narratives about slavery, about enslavers, about the South, about the North, about emancipation, about abolitionists — many of whom didn’t believe in slavery but also didn’t believe in racial equality. And the legacy of that is very different than the legacy we’ve been taught. So for me, it begins with honesty. If you’ve done something wrong to someone else and you genuinely don’t know what you’ve done wrong, you’re not going to be able to fully reconcile with that person. You’re not going to be able to adequately apologize. You’re not going to be able to say the things you need to say to create a path toward recovery. You have to know what you did. And once you understand what you did, you can then begin to calibrate all the things that have to happen for you to try to make peace. For you to recover. To create fellowship again. We have committed ourselves in this country to silence about our history, to ignorance about our history, to denying our history. And that’s the first part of this relationship that has to be repaired. We’ve got to be willing now to talk honestly about who we are and how we got here. Ezra Klein A word you used a few times there was “we.” But when we begin having this conversation about our history, the shared national identity that gets taken for granted in other contexts begins to dissolve very fast. After 9/11, or after winning World War II or during an election, people talk about Americans as a “we” no matter when their ancestors got here. They tend to associate themselves with its founding, its lineages, its victories. But then you get into its misdeeds, its injustices, its sins, and the idea there is a “we” here becomes very difficult for people. People say things like, “ Well, I wasn’t here. I didn’t do any of that. My grandparents came here from Ireland in 1942.” How do you deal with the pronouns in this conversation? Who is talking? Who is listening? Who owes what to whom? Bryan Stevenson I think you’re exactly right. There is a tendency when it comes to mistakes, misconduct, abuse, to disassociate yourself from those things while running to embrace every aspect of achievement. “We won the most medals at the United States Olympics.” Well, you didn’t win any medals, but we do invoke ownership. So I believe it’s important for anyone who identifies as an American, as a citizen of this country, to not simply embrace all the things about American history that we think are glorious and wonderful, but to also acknowledge and accept the things about our history that are tragic and devastating. What’s interesting for me, when I look at the experience of African Americans in particular, Black people have been so committed to this country, they’ve been so committed to the identity of an America that is committed to equality and justice. In the 250 years of enslavement in which Black people endured being kidnapped, put in chains, brutalized, mistreated, abused, raped — there was daily humiliation and degradation, the violence of slavery. That kind of abuse and mistreatment finally ends in 1865 after the Civil War, after the ratification of the 13th Amendment. And instead of seeking revenge or retribution or violence against those who had enslaved them, emancipated Black people said, “ We’re going to make peace here. We’re going to make community here. We’re going to commit to education. We’re going to commit to voting. We’re going to become ideal American citizens. ” When you think about all of the brutality and violence and abuse that Black people suffered and they still were willing to live in harmony with those who had abused them, it says something remarkable about the power of “we.” They believed in an America and they got no credit for that. What they got instead was more abuse. There were over 2,000 lynchings between 1865 and 1877. One of the most violent periods in American history. And yet, for 100 years, they still believed enough in the American idea that they would continue finding ways to contribute. You saw those contributions in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. And then when they got back from war, they’d be targeted for violence by white supremacists who feared their American military service might cause them to believe that they were an equal. What Dr. King and Rosa Parks and others do in the 1950s and ’60s is so rooted in a commitment to the American identity. To me, the model that African Americans have established with this country is that even when things are not good we invoke this idea of an American identity. It means that we absolutely have to be willing to acknowledge the things that are harmful, that are injurious in the American South. The entire American South benefited from the institution of slavery — the entire United States did. The rail lines that allowed those companies in the North to become industrialists, the industries that gave rise to all of that growth during the first half of the 20th century — all of it had its roots in this forced labor stolen from Black bodies. We have to understand that to really be honest. There is no way of saying “they did that.” If we’re going to claim American citizenship and American identity, there has to be a willingness to say “we” just like there’s that willingness to say “we” when an American does something great. Ezra Klein In an interview you did at MOMA in 2015, you had this line that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since: “We need to engage everyone in a meaningful conversation about what it would take to cleanse ourselves of the legacy of slavery.” When I first heard that I thought it was obvious.

The NYPD says it will expand a small but widely praised Brooklyn policing experiment that swapped cops for community support on a two-block stretch in Brownsville. During the five-day pilot program last month, a collection of Cure Violence groups, community organizations and city agencies called the Brownsville Safety Alliance set up information booths on Mother Gaston Boulevard as cops from the 73rd Precinct withdrew from their regular posts. Officers remained a 911 call away from responding to any emergencies. During a City Council hearing on police reform Monday, Chief of Patrol Juanita Holmes pledged to grow the program. “I like it, I love it,” Holmes said, responding to questions from Council Justice Committee Chair Adrienne Adams (D-Queens), who cited THE CITY’s reporting on the Brownsville effort. Holmes told the Council another round of the program is in the works elsewhere in Brooklyn.

The analysis includes new information on how the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program contributes to the city’s soaring arrest rates for marijuana possession. Racial Justice Policing Criminal Legal System Share: The New York Civil Liberties Union today released an analysis of the NYPD’s 2012 stop-and-frisk data showing that the stop-and-frisk program’s stark racial disparities and ineffectiveness in recovering illegal guns continued last year despite a decline in the overall number of stops. The analysis includes new information on how the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program contributes to the city’s soaring arrest rates for marijuana possession. “Despite the welcome decline in the overall number of stops, the NYPD last year still subjected hundreds of thousands of innocent people to humiliating, intimidating and unjustified stop-and-frisk encounters,” NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman said. “With a 90-percent failure rate, the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program remains a tremendous waste of resources, sows mistrust between police and the communities of color and routinely violates fundamental rights. The city’s next mayor must make a clean break from the Bloomberg administration’s ineffective and abusive stop-and-frisk regime.” Last year, the NYPD stopped and interrogated people 532,911 times, a 448-percent increase in street stops since 2002 – when police recorded 97,296 stops during Mayor Bloomberg’s first year in office. Nine out of 10 of people stopped were innocent, meaning they were neither arrested nor ticketed. About 87 percent were black or Latino. White people accounted for only about 10 percent of stops. The NYCLU analyzed the NYPD’s full 2012 computerized stop-and-frisk database, which contains detailed information not included in the quarterly stop-and-frisk reports the Police Department provides the City Council. The analysis examines multiple aspects of the 2012 stop-and-frisk data, including stops, frisks, use of force, reason for stop and recovery of weapons. The analysis provides detailed information at a precinct level and a close examination of race-related aspects of stop-and-frisk. The NYCLU’s analysis reveals that: The 532,911 stops in 2012 (a 22-percent decrease from 2011) were spread unevenly amongst the city’s 76 police precincts, with the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn (East New York) leading the city with 24,408 stops and, excluding the Central Park Precinct, the 17th Precinct in Manhattan (Kips Bay) having the fewest stops at 1,331. In 71 out of 76 precincts, black and Latino people accounted for more than 50 percent of stops, and in 36 precincts they accounted for more than 90 percent of stops. In the 10 precincts with the lowest black and Latino populations (such as the 6th Precinct in Greenwich Village), blacks and Latinos accounted for more than 70 percent of stops in six of those precincts. Young black and Latino men were the targets of a hugely disproportionate number of stops. Though they account for only 4.7 percent of the city’s population, black and Latino males between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 40.6 percent of stops in 2012. The number of stops of young black men neared the entire city population of young black men (133,119 as compared to 158,406). More than 90 percent of young black and Latino men stopped were innocent. Though frisks can be legally conducted only when an officer reasonably suspects the person has a weapon that might endanger officer safety, 55.8 percent of those stopped in 2012 were frisked. Of those frisked, a weapon was found only 2 percent of the time. Frisks varied enormously by precinct, with officers in the 110th Precinct in Queens frisking people 81.4 percent of the time, as compared to a low of 27.3 percent in the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Black and Latino New Yorkers were more likely to be frisked than whites and were less likely to be found with a weapon. In 2012 as compared to 2003, the earliest year that a gun recovery figure is available, the NYPD conducted 372,060 more stops but recovered only 96 more guns. That amounts to an additional recovery rate of 0.02 percent. Of the 473,644 stops of innocent people in 2012, 53.7 percent were frisked. The 75th Precinct led the city in stops of innocent people with 22,776 such stops, excluding the Central Park Precinct, the 17th Precinct had the fewest with 1,181. More than 26,000 people were stopped for alleged marijuana possession. More people were arrested for marijuana-possession offenses than for any other type of offense.  Despite the NYPD’s repeated claim that its stop-and-frisk program is valuable because it targets guns, the facts show it is much more a marijuana arrest program. In 2012 the NYPD recovered 729 guns through the stop-and-frisk; by contrast, more than 5,000 people were arrested last year under the program for marijuana-possession offenses. “The NYPD defends its abusive stop-and-frisk program as the reason why New York City’s streets are safe. But last year stops went down 22 percent and homicide was at an all time low. This gives the lie to the NYPD’s repeated claims that more and more stops are needed to save lives,” said NYCLU Associate Legal Director Christopher Dunn. The NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices have been on trial over the past two months in Floyd v. City of New York – a federal class-action lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging the constitutionality of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices. The remedy phase of the trial, which concluded Monday, involved Ligon v. City of New York , a lawsuit filed by the NYCLU, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP challenging the NYPD’s enforcement of Operation Clean Halls – a citywide program within the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk regime that allows police officers to patrol in and around certain private apartment buildings. The NYCLU sued the NYPD in 2007 for access to the Police Department’s electronic stop-and-frisk database. In 2008, a State Supreme Court judge ordered the NYPD to turn over the database. Prior to that, the NYPD withheld detailed information of its stop-and-frisk program. The NYCLU has also been working with its coalition partners in Communities United for Police Reform and leaders in the City Council for passage of the Community Safety Act, a landmark police reform package designed to help end discriminatory policing and bring real accountability to the NYPD by creating an Inspector General over the NYPD and creating a strong ban on profiling. “The evidence remains clear: The NYPD’s stop, question & frisk policy has a disparate impact on young men of color – the overwhelming majority of whom have done nothing wrong,” said City Councilman Brad Lander. “Even in Park Slope, where 67 percent of the population is white, 84.8 percent of the stops in 2012 were of black and Latino people. So this is not a matter of simply going where the crime is. That’s why we must pass Intro 800-A, to strengthen New York City’s prohibition on discriminatory profiling by establishing a thoughtfully-tailored private right of action. We all want a safe city, but we can’t make our city truly safe by profiling our neighbors.” “The NYPD’s policy towards stop, question and frisk is still inordinately targeting young men of color and harassing an overwhelming majority of innocent New Yorkers,” said City Councilman Jumaane Williams. “This practice has been utterly divisive and corrosive to the essential relationship between historically disenfranchised communities and the police charged with protecting them. I am confident that with the passage of the Community Safety Act, including an enforceable ban on bias-based profiling and an inspector general over the NYPD, we can bring about better policing and safer streets for all.” Related Content Apr 25, 2025 Press Release NYCLU Slams DOJ Lawsuit Against City of Rochester Over Immigration Enforcement Immigrants' Rights Policing Apr 24, 2025 Press Release New Filings: Government Admits It Had No Warrant for Mahmoud Khalil When Agents Took Him Free Speech Education Apr 18, 2025 Press Release New NYCLU Analysis Shows Skyrocketing, Racially-Biased NYPD Vehicle Stops and Searches Policing Apr 11, 2025 Press Release NYCLU Condemns Violent Arrest of Two Black Men During Traffic Stop in Syracuse Policing Analysis Finds Racial Disparities, Ineffectiveness in NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Program; Links Tactic to Soaring Marijuana Arrest Rate The New York Civil Liberties Union today released an analysis of the NYPD’s 2012 stop-and-frisk data showing that the stop-and-frisk program’s stark racial disparities and ineffectiveness in recovering illegal guns continued last year despite a decline in the overall number of stops.

The 75th Precinct led the city in stops of innocent people with 22,776 such stops, excluding the Central Park Precinct, the 17th Precinct had the fewest with 1,181. More than 26,000 people were stopped for alleged marijuana possession. More people were arrested for marijuana-possession offenses than for any other type of offense.  Despite the NYPD’s repeated claim that its stop-and-frisk program is valuable because it targets guns, the facts show it is much more a marijuana arrest program. In 2012 the NYPD recovered 729 guns through the stop-and-frisk; by contrast, more than 5,000 people were arrested last year under the program for marijuana-possession offenses. “The NYPD defends its abusive stop-and-frisk program as the reason why New York City’s streets are safe. But last year stops went down 22 percent and homicide was at an all time low. This gives the lie to the NYPD’s repeated claims that more and more stops are needed to save lives,” said NYCLU Associate Legal Director Christopher Dunn. The NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices have been on trial over the past two months in Floyd v. City of New York – a federal class-action lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging the constitutionality of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices. The remedy phase of the trial, which concluded Monday, involved Ligon v. City of New York , a lawsuit filed by the NYCLU, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP challenging the NYPD’s enforcement of Operation Clean Halls – a citywide program within the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk regime that allows police officers to patrol in and around certain private apartment buildings. The NYCLU sued the NYPD in 2007 for access to the Police Department’s electronic stop-and-frisk database. In 2008, a State Supreme Court judge ordered the NYPD to turn over the database. Prior to that, the NYPD withheld detailed information of its stop-and-frisk program. The NYCLU has also been working with its coalition partners in Communities United for Police Reform and leaders in the City Council for passage of the Community Safety Act, a landmark police reform package designed to help end discriminatory policing and bring real accountability to the NYPD by creating an Inspector General over the NYPD and creating a strong ban on profiling. “The evidence remains clear: The NYPD’s stop, question & frisk policy has a disparate impact on young men of color – the overwhelming majority of whom have done nothing wrong,” said City Councilman Brad Lander. “Even in Park Slope, where 67 percent of the population is white, 84.8 percent of the stops in 2012 were of black and Latino people. So this is not a matter of simply going where the crime is. That’s why we must pass Intro 800-A, to strengthen New York City’s prohibition on discriminatory profiling by establishing a thoughtfully-tailored private right of action. We all want a safe city, but we can’t make our city truly safe by profiling our neighbors.” “The NYPD’s policy towards stop, question and frisk is still inordinately targeting young men of color and harassing an overwhelming majority of innocent New Yorkers,” said City Councilman Jumaane Williams. “This practice has been utterly divisive and corrosive to the essential relationship between historically disenfranchised communities and the police charged with protecting them. I am confident that with the passage of the Community Safety Act, including an enforceable ban on bias-based profiling and an inspector general over the NYPD, we can bring about better policing and safer streets for all.” Related Content Apr 25, 2025 Press Release NYCLU Slams DOJ Lawsuit Against City of Rochester Over Immigration Enforcement Immigrants' Rights Policing NYCLU Slams DOJ Lawsuit Against City of Rochester Over Immigration Enforcement Immigrants' Rights Policing Apr 24, 2025 Press Release New Filings: Government Admits It Had No Warrant for Mahmoud Khalil When Agents Took Him Free Speech Education New Filings: Government Admits It Had No Warrant for Mahmoud Khalil When Agents Took Him Free Speech Education Apr 18, 2025 Press Release New NYCLU Analysis Shows Skyrocketing, Racially-Biased NYPD Vehicle Stops and Searches Policing New NYCLU Analysis Shows Skyrocketing, Racially-Biased NYPD Vehicle Stops and Searches Policing Apr 11, 2025 Press Release NYCLU Condemns Violent Arrest of Two Black Men During Traffic Stop in Syracuse Policing NYCLU Condemns Violent Arrest of Two Black Men During Traffic Stop in Syracuse Policing      Home Issues About How We Work Our People Regional Offices Careers Contact Us   How We Work Our People Regional Offices Careers Contact Us Resources Campaigns & Actions Know Your Rights Policy Court Cases Data   Campaigns & Actions Know Your Rights Policy Court Cases Data Ideas Commentary Podcasts Reports   Commentary Podcasts Reports Get Involved Take Action Volunteer Events   Take Action Volunteer Events Press Statements   Statements User Agreement Privacy Statement Website Accessibility Federal Transparency In Coverage

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC5759331  NIHMSID: NIHMS931248  PMID: 27320215 The publisher's version of this article is available at Am J Prev Med Abstract Context Children from low-income and racial or ethnic minority populations in the U.S. are less likely to have a conventional source of medical care and more likely to develop chronic health problems than are more-affluent and non-Hispanic white children. They are more often chronically stressed, tired, and hungry, and more likely to have impaired vision and hearing—obstacles to lifetime educational achievement and predictors of adult morbidity and premature mortality. If school-based health centers (SBHCs) can overcome educational obstacles and increase receipt of needed medical services in disadvantaged populations, they can advance health equity. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted for papers published through July 2014. Using Community Guide systematic review methods, reviewers identified, abstracted, and summarized available evidence of the effectiveness of SBHCs on educational and health-related outcomes. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015. Evidence synthesis Most of the 46 studies included in the review evaluated onsite clinics serving urban, low-income, and racial or ethnic minority high school students. The presence and use of SBHCs were associated with improved educational (i.e., grade point average, grade promotion, suspension, and non-completion rates) and health-related outcomes (i.e., vaccination and other preventive services, asthma morbidity, emergency department use and hospital admissions, contraceptive use among females, prenatal care, birth weight, illegal substance use, and alcohol consumption). More services and more hours of availability were associated with greater reductions in emergency department overuse. Conclusions Because SBHCs improve educational and health-related outcomes in disadvantaged students, they can be effective in advancing health equity. Context In the U.S., inequalities by race, ethnicity, and income in key health outcomes and educational achievement are well documented. 1 – 8 Although educational inequalities have declined modestly in recent years, they persist. 3 , 5 , 9 – 11 Health outcomes and educational achievement are related to each other by several causal pathways. Health problems (e.g., vision and oral health problems, asthma, teen pregnancy, malnutrition, obesity, chronic stress, and inattention and hyperactivity disorders) and risk-taking behavior (e.g., aggression and violence, unsafe sexual activity, unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and substance use) are associated with low scholastic performance. 12 – 22 Conversely, low academic achievement is strongly associated with risk-taking behavior, compromised health status, and reduced longevity. 22 – 33 Children from low-income and racial or ethnic minority populations in the U.S. are more likely to develop chronic health problems than are more-affluent and non-Hispanic white children and less likely to have a usual source of medical care. 1 Thus, if school-based health centers (SBHCs) can increase receipt of needed medical services and overcome educational obstacles in disadvantaged populations, they can advance health equity. For purposes of this review, SBHCs are defined as clinics that provide health services to students in pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12. Services may be offered onsite (i.e., school-based centers) or offsite (i.e., school-linked centers) and are often established in schools that serve predominantly low-income communities. SBHCs have the following characteristics: SBHCs must provide primary health care and may also provide mental health care, social services, dental care, and health education. Primary care services are sometimes provided by a single clinician, or comprehensive services may be provided by multidisciplinary teams. Services may be available only during some school days or hours, and may also be available in non-school hours. Student participation requires parental consent, and services provided for individual students are sometimes limited for specific types of care, such as reproductive or mental health. Services may be provided to school staff, student family members, and others within the surrounding community. Services are often provided by a medical center or provider independent of the school system, such as a federally qualified health center or academic institution. In 1986, there were only 61 documented SBHCs. 34 By 2013, the School Based Health Alliance (“Alliance,” www.sbh4all.org/ ) used a census to estimate that there were 2,300 SBHCs (1.8% of public and private schools in the U.S.). CDC’s Division of Adolescent and School Health estimates a prevalence of 6.4% of SBHCs in 2006, from a representative sample of U.S. public and private schools. 35 Estimates from the Alliance may be low because their census may be incomplete; Division of Adolescent and School Health estimates may be high because some respondents might have misinterpreted survey questions. According to the most recent Alliance survey, 29.2% of SBHCs provide “primary care only,” whereas 33.4% also provide mental health services and 37.4% offer additional services. 36 Most SBHCs report providing comprehensive health assessments (96.6%); treatment of acute illness (96.1%); prescriptions (96.0%); asthma treatment (94.6%); and screening for vision, hearing, and scoliosis (92.7%). 36 Most SBHCs provide primary prevention services such as immunizations; counseling for healthful eating/active living/weight management (90.1%); pregnancy testing (81.2%); substance abuse (53.2%); violence prevention (92.5%); dropout prevention (59.1%); oral health education (77%); and dental screenings (64.8%). 36 Most SBHCs are open beyond school hours and have prearranged source(s) of after-hours care (70.6%). 36 Previous reviews have found limited evidence of SBHC effectiveness in improving healthcare utilization and academic outcomes. 19 , 37 – 41 Two reviews 19 , 38 considered only academic outcomes, two 37 , 41 considered only reproductive outcomes, and two 39 , 40 considered only access and utilization. This Community Guide report provides the first quantitative, systematic review on the effectiveness of SBHCs, examining a wide array of educational and health-related outcomes and effect modifiers. A separate Community Guide report on the economic efficiency of SBHCs appears elsewhere in this issue. 42 Information about the Community Guide is available in Appendix A (available online) . The primary research question for this review was as follows: How effective are SBHCs in improving educational and health outcomes of disadvantaged students? Secondary research questions were as follows: Is intervention effectiveness affected by ○ extent of services (mental health, dental, social services) in addition to primary care? ○ focus of SBHC on specific health issues (e.g., asthma, immunization, or reproductive health)? ○ availability of services by time (hours or days per week) and proximity (onsite or offsite)? ○ demographic characteristics of the population served? ○ specific SBHC offerings, such as the availability of contraceptives onsite? ○ out-of-pocket cost versus no cost to students? ○ assessing the effect of SBHC on whole-school populations versus on SBHC users only? Evidence Acquisition Conceptual Approach and Analytic Framework It is hypothesized that SBHCs improve educational and health outcomes through several pathways ( Figure 1 ). Specifically, increased access to and satisfaction with health-related services are expected to increase receipt of recommended services a that lead to early detection and treatment or prevention of disease. Increases are expected in school achievement and the proportion of students with a usual place of care, along with reductions in illness, injury, and healthcare overuse (e.g., use of emergency departments [EDs] for non-urgent care). When SBHCs offer health education and counseling, reductions in risk behavior are also expected. Overall, SBHCs are expected to improve the health prospects of low-income and racial and ethnic minority students. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Analytic framework: school-based health centers to promote health equity. Search for Evidence Eight databases were searched from first available dates to July 2014. Full details of the search strategy are in Appendix B (available online) . Inclusion Criteria To qualify for inclusion in this review, a study had to evaluate the relative effectiveness of exposure to (or use of) the services of an SBHC versus a comparison condition that did not include exposure to (or use of) such services; report at least one school achievement or health-related outcome; evaluate an SBHC that served school-aged children (pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12); be published in English; and be conducted in a high-income nation. 43 Four outcomes were excluded because they lacked a plausible or clear mechanism of impact: asthma prevalence; utilization of services not recommended by an authoritative agency such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; non-urgent ED utilization; and school attendance. Although asthmatic events among asthma patients would be subject to reduction by access to SBHCs, the underlying prevalence of asthma would unlikely be affected by SBHCs. Although school attendance would be expected to increase because of SBHC-related reductions in illness, parents sometimes send sick children to school because of treatments available in SBHCs—thus increasing attendance because of sickness; further, sick children may be sent home because of increased SBHC-associated diagnoses, thus decreasing attendance. The improvement of health equity would have been reported if assessed in included studies. In addition, it is assumed that if SBHCs are effective in improving health outcomes and are targeted to low-income and minority communities, SBHCs are effective in improving health equity. Assessing and Summarizing the Body of Evidence of Effectiveness Study abstraction and quality assessment Two reviewers independently evaluated each study included in the review. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Information on study methods, results, and interpretation was abstracted following standard Community Guide criteria. 44 Using Community Guide methods, 44 , 45 each study was assessed for threats to internal and external validity—including inadequate descriptions of the intervention, population, sampling frame, and inclusion/exclusion criteria; inadequate measurement of exposure or outcome; inappropriate analytic methods; high attrition; and failure to control for confounding. Study quality of execution was characterized as good (one or fewer threats to validity); fair (two to four threats); or limited (five or more threats). Studies of limited quality of execution were excluded from analysis. Statistical analysis and synthesis of results Effect estimates were calculated for each study using relative percent or absolute percentage point change or difference in review outcomes. Absolute percentage point change or difference was used only for preventive screening or counseling and immunization. These outcomes generally have low baseline values, and small changes in the outcome could produce a large relative change or difference. With outcome measures that were sufficiently homogenous, effect estimates from individual studies were pooled to calculate an overall median as the summary measure. When at least five independent effect estimates were available, interquartile intervals (IQIs) were calculated to provide a measure of variation; otherwise, tables indicate the range of estimates. A meta-analysis was not conducted because of the heterogeneity of study designs and the small number of studies per outcome. Whereas some studies aggregated effect estimates from multiple study sites or school grades, many studies reported multiple effect estimates per outcome (e.g., by SBHC site, grade level). To give each study equal statistical weight, medians were calculated for studies with multiple effect estimates. Review studies were categorized into two types based on differences in SBHC exposure for the intervention and comparison groups: studies of the effects of SBHCs on entire student bodies ( whole-school effects ) assessed effects on all students in SBHC schools (including SBHC users and non-users) compared with all students in non-SBHC schools, or effects in school populations post-SBHC implementation compared with pre-SBHC implementation; and studies of the effects of SBHCs on SBHC users only ( SBHC user–only effects ) compared with SBHC non-users in schools with SBHCs or community care clinics. When studies included both whole-school and SBHC user–only effect estimates, the former estimates were used in calculating a summary effect measure (i.e., median) because these estimates indicate schoolwide SBHC effects. Overall medians presented in this article combine whole-school and SBHC user–only effects. Most studies that conducted longitudinal analyses did not collect baseline data before the study SBHC had been established. For studies in which the earliest data were collected within 6 months of SBHC opening and study outcomes required >6 months to manifest (e.g., birth, health status, educational outcomes), study baselines were treated as approximations of true baseline data, and the studies were considered longitudinal. Conversely, for studies in which the earliest data were collected >6 months after SBHC opening and study outcomes could be achieved within 6 months (e.g., vaccination or contraceptive uptake), the study baselines were not treated as approximations of true baselines and the studies were considered cross-sectional. When relevant data were available, stratified analyses were conducted to investigate secondary research questions. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether studies with better design and execution—the strongest evidence available—were consistent with the overall body of evidence. Analyses were performed in 2014–2015. Evidence Synthesis Descriptive Results and Applicability of Findings The literature search identified 50 studies in 52 papers that met the inclusion criteria 46 – 97 ; four 50 , 63 , 64 , 80 of these were excluded from analysis because of quality of execution limitations ( Figure 2 ). Six studies 46 , 70 , 78 , 90 , 93 , 94 reported that a median of 59% (IQI=43%, 88%) of students in schools with SBHCs enrolled in the clinics (although not all enrollees used the clinics). Five studies 46 , 70 , 76 , 78 , 90 reported that a median of 69% (IQI=61%, 82%) of students who enrolled in SBHCs received services. Across 15 studies, 54 , 56 , 59 , 62 , 68 , 71 , 73 , 79 , 84 , 86 – 88 , 91 , 92 , 96 a median of 52% (IQI=38%, 61%) of students in schools with SBHCs used the clinics. A summary of evidence from included studies is available on the Community Guide website ( www.thecommunityguide.org/healthequity/education/supportingmaterials/SET-schoolbasedhealthcenters.pdf ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Search process. Of the 46 studies in the analytic data set, 23 studies in 24 papers 51 – 55 , 57 , 58 , 60 – 62 , 70 – 73 , 75 , 77 , 81 – 84 , 86 , 93 , 95 , 96 assessed SBHC whole-school effects by comparing all students in SBHCs with all students in non-SBHC settings (14 studies 51 – 53 , 55 , 58 , 60 – 62 , 73 , 81 , 84 , 86 , 93 , 96 ) or students in schools before and after the implementation of SBHCs (eight studies 54 , 57 , 71 , 75 , 77 , 82 , 83 , 95 ); one study in two papers 70 , 72 included both comparisons. Seventeen studies in 18 papers 46 – 49 , 56 , 65 – 69 , 74 , 78 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 assessed SBHC user–only effects by comparing users with non-users within SBHC schools (eight studies 46 , 68 , 69 , 78 , 88 , 91 , 92 , 94 ) or SBHC users with users of healthcare sources in non-SBHC settings (nine studies in ten papers 47 – 49 , 56 , 65 – 67 , 74 , 85 , 89 ). Four studies 59 , 76 , 78 , 90 assessed both whole-school and SBHC user–only effects. Additionally, two studies 87 , 97 compared SBHCs, one 87 comparing an SBHC with onsite contraceptive services with an SBHC without onsite contraceptive services and the other 97 comparing an SBHC before and after implementation of onsite contraceptive services—thus evaluating the effectiveness of the contraceptive services rather than the SBHC itself. Thirty-two studies in 33 papers 46 – 48 , 51 – 53 , 55 – 62 , 65 , 68 , 69 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 79 , 81 – 83 , 86 – 88 , 90 – 93 , 95 , 97 were published after 2000, and only four studies in five papers 49 , 54 , 70 , 72 , 89 before 1990. Only three studies 51 , 75 , 92 evaluated hybrid school-based and school-linked centers, and no studies evaluated exclusively school-linked centers or mobile clinics. Results of this review are largely applicable to the urban context, as only ten studies in 11 papers 51 , 52 , 58 , 70 , 72 , 75 , 76 , 79 , 90 , 92 , 96 were conducted in mixed rural and urban or suburban areas, and none in predominantly rural areas. Applicability to younger grade levels is limited, as most studies (26 studies in 28 papers 46 – 49 , 52 , 54 , 55 , 59 , 62 , 65 , 66 , 68 – 74 , 81 , 82 , 85 , 87 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 , 96 , 97 ) evaluated high school SBHCs, whereas one study 83 assessed middle school SBHCs, seven studies 57 , 58 , 67 , 77 , 83 , 93 , 95 evaluated pre-Kindergarten or elementary school SBHCs, and the remaining 12 studies 51 , 56 , 60 , 61 , 75 , 76 , 78 , 79 , 84 , 86 , 88 , 90 assessed combinations of grade levels. The effects of the range of SBHC services were evaluated: 23 studies in 24 papers 49 , 52 – 56 , 59 , 69 – 72 , 74 , 77 – 79 , 82 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 91 – 93 , 96 , 97 compared SBHCs that provided primary care only (often including reproductive services); nine studies in ten papers 47 , 48 , 62 , 68 , 73 , 75 , 81 , 87 , 90 , 94 assessed SBHCs that also provided mental health care; and 13 studies 46 , 51 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 65 – 67 , 76 , 83 , 84 , 86 , 95 provided some combination of primary care and mental, dental, or social services. Most studies (28 studies in 29 papers 47 , 48 , 52 – 56 , 58 , 59 , 62 , 69 , 75 – 79 , 81 – 83 , 85 – 88 , 91 – 94 , 96 , 97 ) did not report hours of operation; among those that did, only two SBHCs 49 , 89 were open for fewer than normal school hours. The study populations were largely from racial and ethnic minority and low-income communities. Only six studies 61 , 74 , 89 , 90 , 96 , 97 evaluated SBHCs in majority white populations, with more studies evaluating SBHCs in majority black (16 studies in 18 papers 47 , 48 , 53 , 60 , 62 , 69 , 70 , 72 , 77 , 78 , 81 – 86 , 94 , 95 ); majority Hispanic (eight studies 46 , 55 , 56 , 59 , 65 , 87 , 88 , 93 ); or populations without a majority racial or ethnic group (seven studies 49 , 51 , 68 , 76 , 79 , 91 , 92 ). Nine studies 52 , 54 , 57 , 58 , 66 , 67 , 71 , 73 , 75 did not report the race or ethnicity of the study population. Nineteen studies in 21 papers 46 – 48 , 51 , 53 , 57 , 60 – 62 , 70 , 72 , 76 – 79 , 82 – 84 , 86 , 87 , 95 evaluated majority low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid, free or reduced-price lunch); 22 studies 49 , 52 , 54 – 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 , 67 , 69 , 71 , 73 – 75 , 81 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 92 – 94 , 97 did not report the SES of study participants; and only five studies 65 , 68 , 90 , 91 , 96 were conducted in study populations with less than half low-income participants. School-Based Health Center Effects on Educational and Health-Related Outcomes Substantial educational benefits associated with SBHCs included reductions in rates of school suspension or high school non-completion, and increases in grade point averages and grade promotion ( Table 1 ; Appendix Figure 1, available online ). Healthcare utilization also improved, including substantial increases in recommended immunizations and other preventive services, and a small increase in the proportion of students who reported a regular source of health care. There were benefits to students with asthma, including reductions in symptoms and incidents. Effects on self-reported health and mental health status were small; however, the presence of SBHCs was associated with substantial reductions in ED visits and hospital utilization for all conditions. Associations between SBHC exposure and risk behaviors were mixed, with apparent increases in cigarette smoking but reductions in consumption of alcohol and other substances. Regarding sexual and reproductive behaviors associated with SBHCs, contraceptive use among females increased, childbirth decreased, and prenatal care improved ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

Additional Analyses Range of offered services Schools with SBHCs that offered four services experienced the greatest reduction in total ED utilization (median reduction of 25.1%; IQI= −34.1%, −12.5%; seven studies 51 , 58 , 61 , 65 , 66 , 84 , 86 ) compared with those that offered three or fewer services (median increase of 4.5%; range, −39.8% to 37.8%; six studies in seven papers 46 , 62 , 70 , 72 , 73 , 76 , 95 ) ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effect modification: impact of range of services offered on ED visits. Hours of availability SBHCs accessible outside of regular school hours were associated with greater reductions in total ED utilization and hospitalizations (median reduction of 37.0%; range, −75% to −15.5%; four studies 46 , 65 , 66 , 84 ) than SBHCs accessible only during regular school hours (median reduction of 5.2%; range, −47.9% to 37.8%; four studies 61 , 72 , 73 , 93 ) ( Appendix Figure 15, available online ). One study 52 reported improved contraceptive use associated with increased hours of SBHC availability. Socioeconomic position One study 79 found greater reduction in high school non-completion for students at schools with SBHCs who received free or reduced-price lunch compared with those not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Onsite and offsite contraceptive dispensing Seven studies 54 , 55 , 71 , 72 , 81 , 87 , 97 provided details on contraceptive dispensation, but results were inconclusive ( Appendix Figures 16 and 17, available online ). One study 72 compared multiple study sites and found that onsite access to contraceptives increased female but not male use of contraceptives, with no effect observed for pregnancy outcomes. Two studies 87 , 97 investigated this question with internal comparisons, and both found onsite access to contraceptives associated with increased contraceptive uptake and reduced pregnancy rates. Whole-school versus school-based health center user–only effects Analysis of the whole-school effects versus effects for SBHC users only indicated no clear pattern of differences (results not shown). Sensitivity analyses Overall, findings on 26 outcomes were reported, of which 16 findings were based on bodies of evidence including at least one study of greatest design suitability 51 , 59 – 61 , 68 , 69 , 73 , 76 , 79 , 81 , 82 , 90 – 92 ; findings for the studies of greatest design suitability were consistent with the overall body of evidence for 13 outcomes and inconsistent for three outcomes (i.e., non–asthma related ED use, contraception use, and sexual activity). Nine of the greatest design suitability studies 51 , 59 – 61 , 69 , 81 , 82 , 90 , 91 were also of good quality of execution; all were consistent with the overall body of evidence. Data were not adequate to distinguish between the effects of SBHC service proximity and the effects of SBHC service costs. Descriptions of program contents were often incomplete in available studies; in addition, there were likely associations between program focus and the assessment and reporting of targeted outcomes, thus biasing the evaluation of the association between program focus and program outcomes. Discussion Summary of Findings This review found that SBHCs are effective in improving an array of educational and health-related outcomes. Increased effectiveness was associated with extended hours of availability and increased range of offered services. Because SBHCs aim to meet the needs of disadvantaged populations, 36 address the health-related obstacles to educational achievement, and address the cultural, financial, and privacy- and transportation-related barriers to clinical, preventive, and healthcare services, they have the potential to promote social mobility 98 and improve health equity. Limitations Although the review included a relatively large number of studies, synthesis presented unusual challenges, and some included studies have methodologic limitations. First, lack of randomization might have resulted in selection bias. Few studies adjusted for background health differences, and it is unclear whether users and non-users or SBHC sites and non-SBHC sites were comparable. SBHC placement was influenced by the greater healthcare needs of the school community, the presence, proximity, quality, or absence of other community health resources, or political and financial factors; the effects of these selection biases on estimates of SBHC effectiveness were not controlled. Lastly, SBHC effects might have been underestimated or overestimated because evaluators did not obtain true baseline data. Other Benefits and Potential Harms Increased parental work time and reduced child care, transportation needs, time, and costs have been identified in the broader literature as additional benefits of SBHCs. 99 – 101 Because many SBHCs are open to others in the community, 36 improvements in health (and education) in the broader community are also expected. There are reports that SBHCs provide more-sensitive care (e.g., for reproductive health and mental health) than may be available in other settings, 48 , 49 , 66 , 74 , 89 , 102 and improve quality of care 74 and patient satisfaction with and acceptability of care. 58 , 103 , 104 Services provided to community members may complement rather than replace or duplicate those available in the community. 65 , 66 , 76 , 105 Additionally, benefit is anticipated to extend beyond SBHC users, as many SBHCs offer health education and promotion activities to the entire student body, and non-users may adopt some of the promoted health behaviors (e.g., abstaining from drugs and alcohol). 79 SBHCs also have been reported to improve student academic expectations, safety and respect, and school engagement 106 ; to increase adolescents’ responsibility for and awareness of their health 104 ; and to strengthen connections between community and school. 107 Because of improved vaccination uptake, reduced transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases is also expected. Additionally, most SBHCs help children and families enroll in Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. 36 Some authors 108 – 110 have suggested that SBHCs might fragment a child’s health care by adding a separate source of care not necessarily linked to other sources. This review did not find evidence supporting this concern, but did find marginal increases in the proportion of students reporting that an SBHC provided a source of regular care. For disadvantaged students who have not had a usual source of care, the SBHC may become the regular source. Additionally, it has been reported that some SBHCs link with other sources of care through health information technology 36 , 107 and referral to community care providers for after-hours care. Another postulated harm involves increased sexual activity owing to increased access to contraceptive services. 55 Results from this review neither support nor contradict this hypothesis. Finally, the review found no evidence regarding the concern that SBHCs undermine parental authority over medical decisions for their children. 111 Evidence Gaps A number of research questions remain: Although SBHCs are usually located in high-need communities, the proportions of students who enroll, and those enrollees who receive SBHCs’ services, are often less than those in need of these services. What strategies would increase use of SBHC services? Are SBHCs effective in schools and communities with majorities of higher-income and non-Hispanic white students? Are there thresholds or points of diminishing returns on community income, insurance coverage, and other measures of need above which SBHCs are less effective? SBHCs usually offer services to school staff, student family members, and others in the community. What are the effects of SBHCs on the health of these populations? How effective are SBHCs in rural areas with low population density in which a different design of SBHCs may be necessary? What is the effectiveness of school-linked and mobile health centers? Are service uptake and outcomes of SBHCs different for services provided free of charge? What is the relative impact on specific outcomes of focused programs—such as intensive asthma programs or programs focused on reproductive health—when compared with general programs? What are the components of the SBHCs being assessed and the attributes of populations they serve? Better descriptive information is needed for optimal program evaluation, design, and targeting. What are the long-term impacts of SBHCs in academic achievement, income, and health? What synergistic effects, mutual support, or redundancies might occur among SBHCs, school health polices, or classroom health education? Will new SBHC-related studies be able to distinguish between changes caused by SBHCs themselves and changes caused by implementation of the Affordable Care Act? Conclusions Despite methodologic limitations, the breadth and consistency of the evidence, and the finding that the better designed and executed studies in the body of evidence confirm overall conclusions, support the conclusion that SBHCs improve both educational and health outcomes. Because SBHCs are commonly implemented in low-income communities and communities with high proportions of racial and ethnic minority populations, this source of student health care may be a prominent means of advancing health equity.

Abstract Context Children from low-income and racial or ethnic minority populations in the U.S. are less likely to have a conventional source of medical care and more likely to develop chronic health problems than are more-affluent and non-Hispanic white children. They are more often chronically stressed, tired, and hungry, and more likely to have impaired vision and hearing—obstacles to lifetime educational achievement and predictors of adult morbidity and premature mortality. If school-based health centers (SBHCs) can overcome educational obstacles and increase receipt of needed medical services in disadvantaged populations, they can advance health equity. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted for papers published through July 2014. Using Community Guide systematic review methods, reviewers identified, abstracted, and summarized available evidence of the effectiveness of SBHCs on educational and health-related outcomes. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015. Evidence synthesis Most of the 46 studies included in the review evaluated onsite clinics serving urban, low-income, and racial or ethnic minority high school students. The presence and use of SBHCs were associated with improved educational (i.e., grade point average, grade promotion, suspension, and non-completion rates) and health-related outcomes (i.e., vaccination and other preventive services, asthma morbidity, emergency department use and hospital admissions, contraceptive use among females, prenatal care, birth weight, illegal substance use, and alcohol consumption). More services and more hours of availability were associated with greater reductions in emergency department overuse. Conclusions Because SBHCs improve educational and health-related outcomes in disadvantaged students, they can be effective in advancing health equity. Context In the U.S., inequalities by race, ethnicity, and income in key health outcomes and educational achievement are well documented. 1 – 8 Although educational inequalities have declined modestly in recent years, they persist. 3 , 5 , 9 – 11 Health outcomes and educational achievement are related to each other by several causal pathways. Health problems (e.g., vision and oral health problems, asthma, teen pregnancy, malnutrition, obesity, chronic stress, and inattention and hyperactivity disorders) and risk-taking behavior (e.g., aggression and violence, unsafe sexual activity, unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and substance use) are associated with low scholastic performance. 12 – 22 Conversely, low academic achievement is strongly associated with risk-taking behavior, compromised health status, and reduced longevity. 22 – 33 Children from low-income and racial or ethnic minority populations in the U.S. are more likely to develop chronic health problems than are more-affluent and non-Hispanic white children and less likely to have a usual source of medical care. 1 Thus, if school-based health centers (SBHCs) can increase receipt of needed medical services and overcome educational obstacles in disadvantaged populations, they can advance health equity. For purposes of this review, SBHCs are defined as clinics that provide health services to students in pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12. Services may be offered onsite (i.e., school-based centers) or offsite (i.e., school-linked centers) and are often established in schools that serve predominantly low-income communities. SBHCs have the following characteristics: SBHCs must provide primary health care and may also provide mental health care, social services, dental care, and health education. SBHCs must provide primary health care and may also provide mental health care, social services, dental care, and health education. Primary care services are sometimes provided by a single clinician, or comprehensive services may be provided by multidisciplinary teams. Primary care services are sometimes provided by a single clinician, or comprehensive services may be provided by multidisciplinary teams. Services may be available only during some school days or hours, and may also be available in non-school hours. Services may be available only during some school days or hours, and may also be available in non-school hours. Student participation requires parental consent, and services provided for individual students are sometimes limited for specific types of care, such as reproductive or mental health.

Services are often provided by a medical center or provider independent of the school system, such as a federally qualified health center or academic institution. In 1986, there were only 61 documented SBHCs. 34 By 2013, the School Based Health Alliance (“Alliance,” www.sbh4all.org/ ) used a census to estimate that there were 2,300 SBHCs (1.8% of public and private schools in the U.S.). CDC’s Division of Adolescent and School Health estimates a prevalence of 6.4% of SBHCs in 2006, from a representative sample of U.S. public and private schools. 35 Estimates from the Alliance may be low because their census may be incomplete; Division of Adolescent and School Health estimates may be high because some respondents might have misinterpreted survey questions. According to the most recent Alliance survey, 29.2% of SBHCs provide “primary care only,” whereas 33.4% also provide mental health services and 37.4% offer additional services. 36 Most SBHCs report providing comprehensive health assessments (96.6%); treatment of acute illness (96.1%); prescriptions (96.0%); asthma treatment (94.6%); and screening for vision, hearing, and scoliosis (92.7%). 36 Most SBHCs provide primary prevention services such as immunizations; counseling for healthful eating/active living/weight management (90.1%); pregnancy testing (81.2%); substance abuse (53.2%); violence prevention (92.5%); dropout prevention (59.1%); oral health education (77%); and dental screenings (64.8%). 36 Most SBHCs are open beyond school hours and have prearranged source(s) of after-hours care (70.6%). 36 Previous reviews have found limited evidence of SBHC effectiveness in improving healthcare utilization and academic outcomes. 19 , 37 – 41 Two reviews 19 , 38 considered only academic outcomes, two 37 , 41 considered only reproductive outcomes, and two 39 , 40 considered only access and utilization. This Community Guide report provides the first quantitative, systematic review on the effectiveness of SBHCs, examining a wide array of educational and health-related outcomes and effect modifiers. A separate Community Guide report on the economic efficiency of SBHCs appears elsewhere in this issue. 42 Information about the Community Guide is available in Appendix A (available online) . The primary research question for this review was as follows: How effective are SBHCs in improving educational and health outcomes of disadvantaged students? How effective are SBHCs in improving educational and health outcomes of disadvantaged students? Secondary research questions were as follows: Is intervention effectiveness affected by ○ extent of services (mental health, dental, social services) in addition to primary care? ○ focus of SBHC on specific health issues (e.g., asthma, immunization, or reproductive health)? ○ availability of services by time (hours or days per week) and proximity (onsite or offsite)? ○ demographic characteristics of the population served? ○ specific SBHC offerings, such as the availability of contraceptives onsite? ○ out-of-pocket cost versus no cost to students? ○ assessing the effect of SBHC on whole-school populations versus on SBHC users only? ○ extent of services (mental health, dental, social services) in addition to primary care? ○ ○ focus of SBHC on specific health issues (e.g., asthma, immunization, or reproductive health)? ○ ○ availability of services by time (hours or days per week) and proximity (onsite or offsite)? ○ ○ demographic characteristics of the population served? ○ ○ specific SBHC offerings, such as the availability of contraceptives onsite? ○ ○ out-of-pocket cost versus no cost to students? ○ ○ assessing the effect of SBHC on whole-school populations versus on SBHC users only? ○ Evidence Acquisition Conceptual Approach and Analytic Framework It is hypothesized that SBHCs improve educational and health outcomes through several pathways ( Figure 1 ). Specifically, increased access to and satisfaction with health-related services are expected to increase receipt of recommended services a that lead to early detection and treatment or prevention of disease. Increases are expected in school achievement and the proportion of students with a usual place of care, along with reductions in illness, injury, and healthcare overuse (e.g., use of emergency departments [EDs] for non-urgent care). When SBHCs offer health education and counseling, reductions in risk behavior are also expected. Overall, SBHCs are expected to improve the health prospects of low-income and racial and ethnic minority students. Figure 1.  Analytic framework: school-based health centers to promote health equity. Search for Evidence Eight databases were searched from first available dates to July 2014. Full details of the search strategy are in Appendix B (available online) . Inclusion Criteria To qualify for inclusion in this review, a study had to evaluate the relative effectiveness of exposure to (or use of) the services of an SBHC versus a comparison condition that did not include exposure to (or use of) such services; evaluate the relative effectiveness of exposure to (or use of) the services of an SBHC versus a comparison condition that did not include exposure to (or use of) such services; report at least one school achievement or health-related outcome; report at least one school achievement or health-related outcome; evaluate an SBHC that served school-aged children (pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12); evaluate an SBHC that served school-aged children (pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12); be published in English; and be published in English; and be conducted in a high-income nation. 43 be conducted in a high-income nation. 43 Four outcomes were excluded because they lacked a plausible or clear mechanism of impact: asthma prevalence; asthma prevalence; utilization of services not recommended by an authoritative agency such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; utilization of services not recommended by an authoritative agency such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; non-urgent ED utilization; and non-urgent ED utilization; and school attendance. school attendance. Although asthmatic events among asthma patients would be subject to reduction by access to SBHCs, the underlying prevalence of asthma would unlikely be affected by SBHCs. Although school attendance would be expected to increase because of SBHC-related reductions in illness, parents sometimes send sick children to school because of treatments available in SBHCs—thus increasing attendance because of sickness; further, sick children may be sent home because of increased SBHC-associated diagnoses, thus decreasing attendance. The improvement of health equity would have been reported if assessed in included studies. In addition, it is assumed that if SBHCs are effective in improving health outcomes and are targeted to low-income and minority communities, SBHCs are effective in improving health equity. Assessing and Summarizing the Body of Evidence of Effectiveness Study abstraction and quality assessment Two reviewers independently evaluated each study included in the review. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Information on study methods, results, and interpretation was abstracted following standard Community Guide criteria. 44 Using Community Guide methods, 44 , 45 each study was assessed for threats to internal and external validity—including inadequate descriptions of the intervention, population, sampling frame, and inclusion/exclusion criteria; inadequate measurement of exposure or outcome; inappropriate analytic methods; high attrition; and failure to control for confounding. Study quality of execution was characterized as good (one or fewer threats to validity); fair (two to four threats); or limited (five or more threats). Studies of limited quality of execution were excluded from analysis. Statistical analysis and synthesis of results Effect estimates were calculated for each study using relative percent or absolute percentage point change or difference in review outcomes. Absolute percentage point change or difference was used only for preventive screening or counseling and immunization. These outcomes generally have low baseline values, and small changes in the outcome could produce a large relative change or difference. With outcome measures that were sufficiently homogenous, effect estimates from individual studies were pooled to calculate an overall median as the summary measure. When at least five independent effect estimates were available, interquartile intervals (IQIs) were calculated to provide a measure of variation; otherwise, tables indicate the range of estimates. A meta-analysis was not conducted because of the heterogeneity of study designs and the small number of studies per outcome. Whereas some studies aggregated effect estimates from multiple study sites or school grades, many studies reported multiple effect estimates per outcome (e.g., by SBHC site, grade level). To give each study equal statistical weight, medians were calculated for studies with multiple effect estimates. Review studies were categorized into two types based on differences in SBHC exposure for the intervention and comparison groups: studies of the effects of SBHCs on entire student bodies ( whole-school effects ) assessed effects on all students in SBHC schools (including SBHC users and non-users) compared with all students in non-SBHC schools, or effects in school populations post-SBHC implementation compared with pre-SBHC implementation; and studies of the effects of SBHCs on entire student bodies ( whole-school effects ) assessed effects on all students in SBHC schools (including SBHC users and non-users) compared with all students in non-SBHC schools, or effects in school populations post-SBHC implementation compared with pre-SBHC implementation; and studies of the effects of SBHCs on SBHC users only ( SBHC user–only effects ) compared with SBHC non-users in schools with SBHCs or community care clinics. studies of the effects of SBHCs on SBHC users only ( SBHC user–only effects ) compared with SBHC non-users in schools with SBHCs or community care clinics. When studies included both whole-school and SBHC user–only effect estimates, the former estimates were used in calculating a summary effect measure (i.e., median) because these estimates indicate schoolwide SBHC effects. Overall medians presented in this article combine whole-school and SBHC user–only effects. Most studies that conducted longitudinal analyses did not collect baseline data before the study SBHC had been established. For studies in which the earliest data were collected within 6 months of SBHC opening and study outcomes required >6 months to manifest (e.g., birth, health status, educational outcomes), study baselines were treated as approximations of true baseline data, and the studies were considered longitudinal. Conversely, for studies in which the earliest data were collected >6 months after SBHC opening and study outcomes could be achieved within 6 months (e.g., vaccination or contraceptive uptake), the study baselines were not treated as approximations of true baselines and the studies were considered cross-sectional. When relevant data were available, stratified analyses were conducted to investigate secondary research questions. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether studies with better design and execution—the strongest evidence available—were consistent with the overall body of evidence. Analyses were performed in 2014–2015. Evidence Synthesis Descriptive Results and Applicability of Findings The literature search identified 50 studies in 52 papers that met the inclusion criteria 46 – 97 ; four 50 , 63 , 64 , 80 of these were excluded from analysis because of quality of execution limitations ( Figure 2 ). Six studies 46 , 70 , 78 , 90 , 93 , 94 reported that a median of 59% (IQI=43%, 88%) of students in schools with SBHCs enrolled in the clinics (although not all enrollees used the clinics). Five studies 46 , 70 , 76 , 78 , 90 reported that a median of 69% (IQI=61%, 82%) of students who enrolled in SBHCs received services. Across 15 studies, 54 , 56 , 59 , 62 , 68 , 71 , 73 , 79 , 84 , 86 – 88 , 91 , 92 , 96 a median of 52% (IQI=38%, 61%) of students in schools with SBHCs used the clinics. A summary of evidence from included studies is available on the Community Guide website ( www.thecommunityguide.org/healthequity/education/supportingmaterials/SET-schoolbasedhealthcenters.pdf ). Figure 2.  Search process. Of the 46 studies in the analytic data set, 23 studies in 24 papers 51 – 55 , 57 , 58 , 60 – 62 , 70 – 73 , 75 , 77 , 81 – 84 , 86 , 93 , 95 , 96 assessed SBHC whole-school effects by comparing all students in SBHCs with all students in non-SBHC settings (14 studies 51 – 53 , 55 , 58 , 60 – 62 , 73 , 81 , 84 , 86 , 93 , 96 ) or students in schools before and after the implementation of SBHCs (eight studies 54 , 57 , 71 , 75 , 77 , 82 , 83 , 95 ); one study in two papers 70 , 72 included both comparisons. Seventeen studies in 18 papers 46 – 49 , 56 , 65 – 69 , 74 , 78 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 assessed SBHC user–only effects by comparing users with non-users within SBHC schools (eight studies 46 , 68 , 69 , 78 , 88 , 91 , 92 , 94 ) or SBHC users with users of healthcare sources in non-SBHC settings (nine studies in ten papers 47 – 49 , 56 , 65 – 67 , 74 , 85 , 89 ). Four studies 59 , 76 , 78 , 90 assessed both whole-school and SBHC user–only effects. Additionally, two studies 87 , 97 compared SBHCs, one 87 comparing an SBHC with onsite contraceptive services with an SBHC without onsite contraceptive services and the other 97 comparing an SBHC before and after implementation of onsite contraceptive services—thus evaluating the effectiveness of the contraceptive services rather than the SBHC itself. Thirty-two studies in 33 papers 46 – 48 , 51 – 53 , 55 – 62 , 65 , 68 , 69 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 79 , 81 – 83 , 86 – 88 , 90 – 93 , 95 , 97 were published after 2000, and only four studies in five papers 49 , 54 , 70 , 72 , 89 before 1990. Only three studies 51 , 75 , 92 evaluated hybrid school-based and school-linked centers, and no studies evaluated exclusively school-linked centers or mobile clinics. Results of this review are largely applicable to the urban context, as only ten studies in 11 papers 51 , 52 , 58 , 70 , 72 , 75 , 76 , 79 , 90 , 92 , 96 were conducted in mixed rural and urban or suburban areas, and none in predominantly rural areas. Applicability to younger grade levels is limited, as most studies (26 studies in 28 papers 46 – 49 , 52 , 54 , 55 , 59 , 62 , 65 , 66 , 68 – 74 , 81 , 82 , 85 , 87 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 , 96 , 97 ) evaluated high school SBHCs, whereas one study 83 assessed middle school SBHCs, seven studies 57 , 58 , 67 , 77 , 83 , 93 , 95 evaluated pre-Kindergarten or elementary school SBHCs, and the remaining 12 studies 51 , 56 , 60 , 61 , 75 , 76 , 78 , 79 , 84 , 86 , 88 , 90 assessed combinations of grade levels. The effects of the range of SBHC services were evaluated: 23 studies in 24 papers 49 , 52 – 56 , 59 , 69 – 72 , 74 , 77 – 79 , 82 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 91 – 93 , 96 , 97 compared SBHCs that provided primary care only (often including reproductive services); nine studies in ten papers 47 , 48 , 62 , 68 , 73 , 75 , 81 , 87 , 90 , 94 assessed SBHCs that also provided mental health care; and 13 studies 46 , 51 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 65 – 67 , 76 , 83 , 84 , 86 , 95 provided some combination of primary care and mental, dental, or social services. Most studies (28 studies in 29 papers 47 , 48 , 52 – 56 , 58 , 59 , 62 , 69 , 75 – 79 , 81 – 83 , 85 – 88 , 91 – 94 , 96 , 97 ) did not report hours of operation; among those that did, only two SBHCs 49 , 89 were open for fewer than normal school hours. The study populations were largely from racial and ethnic minority and low-income communities. Only six studies 61 , 74 , 89 , 90 , 96 , 97 evaluated SBHCs in majority white populations, with more studies evaluating SBHCs in majority black (16 studies in 18 papers 47 , 48 , 53 , 60 , 62 , 69 , 70 , 72 , 77 , 78 , 81 – 86 , 94 , 95 ); majority Hispanic (eight studies 46 , 55 , 56 , 59 , 65 , 87 , 88 , 93 ); or populations without a majority racial or ethnic group (seven studies 49 , 51 , 68 , 76 , 79 , 91 , 92 ). Nine studies 52 , 54 , 57 , 58 , 66 , 67 , 71 , 73 , 75 did not report the race or ethnicity of the study population. Nineteen studies in 21 papers 46 – 48 , 51 , 53 , 57 , 60 – 62 , 70 , 72 , 76 – 79 , 82 – 84 , 86 , 87 , 95 evaluated majority low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid, free or reduced-price lunch); 22 studies 49 , 52 , 54 – 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 , 67 , 69 , 71 , 73 – 75 , 81 , 85 , 88 , 89 , 92 – 94 , 97 did not report the SES of study participants; and only five studies 65 , 68 , 90 , 91 , 96 were conducted in study populations with less than half low-income participants. School-Based Health Center Effects on Educational and Health-Related Outcomes Substantial educational benefits associated with SBHCs included reductions in rates of school suspension or high school non-completion, and increases in grade point averages and grade promotion ( Table 1 ; Appendix Figure 1, available online ). Healthcare utilization also improved, including substantial increases in recommended immunizations and other preventive services, and a small increase in the proportion of students who reported a regular source of health care. There were benefits to students with asthma, including reductions in symptoms and incidents. Effects on self-reported health and mental health status were small; however, the presence of SBHCs was associated with substantial reductions in ED visits and hospital utilization for all conditions. Associations between SBHC exposure and risk behaviors were mixed, with apparent increases in cigarette smoking but reductions in consumption of alcohol and other substances. Regarding sexual and reproductive behaviors associated with SBHCs, contraceptive use among females increased, childbirth decreased, and prenatal care improved ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

Additional Analyses Range of offered services Schools with SBHCs that offered four services experienced the greatest reduction in total ED utilization (median reduction of 25.1%; IQI= −34.1%, −12.5%; seven studies 51 , 58 , 61 , 65 , 66 , 84 , 86 ) compared with those that offered three or fewer services (median increase of 4.5%; range, −39.8% to 37.8%; six studies in seven papers 46 , 62 , 70 , 72 , 73 , 76 , 95 ) ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3.  Effect modification: impact of range of services offered on ED visits. Hours of availability SBHCs accessible outside of regular school hours were associated with greater reductions in total ED utilization and hospitalizations (median reduction of 37.0%; range, −75% to −15.5%; four studies 46 , 65 , 66 , 84 ) than SBHCs accessible only during regular school hours (median reduction of 5.2%; range, −47.9% to 37.8%; four studies 61 , 72 , 73 , 93 ) ( Appendix Figure 15, available online ). One study 52 reported improved contraceptive use associated with increased hours of SBHC availability. Socioeconomic position One study 79 found greater reduction in high school non-completion for students at schools with SBHCs who received free or reduced-price lunch compared with those not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Onsite and offsite contraceptive dispensing Seven studies 54 , 55 , 71 , 72 , 81 , 87 , 97 provided details on contraceptive dispensation, but results were inconclusive ( Appendix Figures 16 and 17, available online ). One study 72 compared multiple study sites and found that onsite access to contraceptives increased female but not male use of contraceptives, with no effect observed for pregnancy outcomes. Two studies 87 , 97 investigated this question with internal comparisons, and both found onsite access to contraceptives associated with increased contraceptive uptake and reduced pregnancy rates. Whole-school versus school-based health center user–only effects Analysis of the whole-school effects versus effects for SBHC users only indicated no clear pattern of differences (results not shown). Sensitivity analyses Overall, findings on 26 outcomes were reported, of which 16 findings were based on bodies of evidence including at least one study of greatest design suitability 51 , 59 – 61 , 68 , 69 , 73 , 76 , 79 , 81 , 82 , 90 – 92 ; findings for the studies of greatest design suitability were consistent with the overall body of evidence for 13 outcomes and inconsistent for three outcomes (i.e., non–asthma related ED use, contraception use, and sexual activity). Nine of the greatest design suitability studies 51 , 59 – 61 , 69 , 81 , 82 , 90 , 91 were also of good quality of execution; all were consistent with the overall body of evidence. Data were not adequate to distinguish between the effects of SBHC service proximity and the effects of SBHC service costs. Descriptions of program contents were often incomplete in available studies; in addition, there were likely associations between program focus and the assessment and reporting of targeted outcomes, thus biasing the evaluation of the association between program focus and program outcomes. Discussion Summary of Findings This review found that SBHCs are effective in improving an array of educational and health-related outcomes. Increased effectiveness was associated with extended hours of availability and increased range of offered services. Because SBHCs aim to meet the needs of disadvantaged populations, 36 address the health-related obstacles to educational achievement, and address the cultural, financial, and privacy- and transportation-related barriers to clinical, preventive, and healthcare services, they have the potential to promote social mobility 98 and improve health equity. Limitations Although the review included a relatively large number of studies, synthesis presented unusual challenges, and some included studies have methodologic limitations. First, lack of randomization might have resulted in selection bias. Few studies adjusted for background health differences, and it is unclear whether users and non-users or SBHC sites and non-SBHC sites were comparable. SBHC placement was influenced by the greater healthcare needs of the school community, the presence, proximity, quality, or absence of other community health resources, or political and financial factors; the effects of these selection biases on estimates of SBHC effectiveness were not controlled. Lastly, SBHC effects might have been underestimated or overestimated because evaluators did not obtain true baseline data. Other Benefits and Potential Harms Increased parental work time and reduced child care, transportation needs, time, and costs have been identified in the broader literature as additional benefits of SBHCs. 99 – 101 Because many SBHCs are open to others in the community, 36 improvements in health (and education) in the broader community are also expected. There are reports that SBHCs provide more-sensitive care (e.g., for reproductive health and mental health) than may be available in other settings, 48 , 49 , 66 , 74 , 89 , 102 and improve quality of care 74 and patient satisfaction with and acceptability of care. 58 , 103 , 104 Services provided to community members may complement rather than replace or duplicate those available in the community. 65 , 66 , 76 , 105 Additionally, benefit is anticipated to extend beyond SBHC users, as many SBHCs offer health education and promotion activities to the entire student body, and non-users may adopt some of the promoted health behaviors (e.g., abstaining from drugs and alcohol). 79 SBHCs also have been reported to improve student academic expectations, safety and respect, and school engagement 106 ; to increase adolescents’ responsibility for and awareness of their health 104 ; and to strengthen connections between community and school. 107 Because of improved vaccination uptake, reduced transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases is also expected. Additionally, most SBHCs help children and families enroll in Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. 36 Some authors 108 – 110 have suggested that SBHCs might fragment a child’s health care by adding a separate source of care not necessarily linked to other sources. This review did not find evidence supporting this concern, but did find marginal increases in the proportion of students reporting that an SBHC provided a source of regular care. For disadvantaged students who have not had a usual source of care, the SBHC may become the regular source. Additionally, it has been reported that some SBHCs link with other sources of care through health information technology 36 , 107 and referral to community care providers for after-hours care. Another postulated harm involves increased sexual activity owing to increased access to contraceptive services. 55 Results from this review neither support nor contradict this hypothesis. Finally, the review found no evidence regarding the concern that SBHCs undermine parental authority over medical decisions for their children. 111 Evidence Gaps A number of research questions remain: Although SBHCs are usually located in high-need communities, the proportions of students who enroll, and those enrollees who receive SBHCs’ services, are often less than those in need of these services. What strategies would increase use of SBHC services? Although SBHCs are usually located in high-need communities, the proportions of students who enroll, and those enrollees who receive SBHCs’ services, are often less than those in need of these services. What strategies would increase use of SBHC services? Are SBHCs effective in schools and communities with majorities of higher-income and non-Hispanic white students? Are there thresholds or points of diminishing returns on community income, insurance coverage, and other measures of need above which SBHCs are less effective?

Will new SBHC-related studies be able to distinguish between changes caused by SBHCs themselves and changes caused by implementation of the Affordable Care Act? Conclusions Despite methodologic limitations, the breadth and consistency of the evidence, and the finding that the better designed and executed studies in the body of evidence confirm overall conclusions, support the conclusion that SBHCs improve both educational and health outcomes. Because SBHCs are commonly implemented in low-income communities and communities with high proportions of racial and ethnic minority populations, this source of student health care may be a prominent means of advancing health equity.

Data would be provided for six specific categories, and be disaggregated by race and ethnicity, where available.  Racial equity reports on housing and opportunity would be required for certain land use applications, using data from the equitable development data tool. The substance of racial equity reports would vary by application type, but all would include a statement of how the proposed project relates to the goals and strategies to affirmatively further fair housing and promote equitable access to opportunity.  Residential projects would state the expected rents for market rate and affordable units and the incomes needed to afford them without incurring housing cost burden.  The equitable development data tool would provide the race/ethnicity for such households. Indexes: Report Required Attachments: 1. Summary of Int. No. 1572-B , 2. Summary of Int. No. 1572-A , 3.

Email address   Email address  Published Feb 6, 2020 Share Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations I moved to New York in 2013, and several months later, I found myself watching the clock in my apartment as I waited for a city social worker to arrive. She was late, and I was anxious to get back to my job at a private investigation firm. Twenty minutes later, the social worker arrived. “You work?” she asked when I told her I’d scheduled our appointment for my lunch break. She’d presumed that I wasn’t employed, and that my schedule was flexible. I use a wheelchair, and the meeting was to determine if I qualified for any government benefits related to my disability. One of the items we discussed was Access-A-Ride, the transit service that provides disabled people with an alternative to the subways, which are largely inaccessible to people in wheelchairs. For the price of a subway ride, a wheelchair accessible van would pick me up at my apartment and drop me at my destination anywhere within the city’s five boroughs. So far so good. But then she explained the fine print. I would have to schedule my ride one to two days in advance. My pick-up time could be an hour earlier or an hour later than requested. The driver would have a 30-minute window in which to pick me up before he would be considered late. I, on the other hand, had to be outside to meet my van within five minutes of its arrival or I would be counted as a no-show. And since the rides were shared, it could take a long time to get where I was going. She told me some users call it “Stress-A-Ride.” I looked at the social worker, bewildered. The program she was touting seemed to make a similar assumption to the one she had made about me — that I didn’t have a job. Like many people who use wheelchairs, I have a full-time job, back then as a private investigator and now as a research reporter for ProPublica. I like to arrive on time. As a journalist, I might have to head to an interview or event on short notice. And after work, I might want to have a drink with a friend. How would Access-A-Ride ever work for me? I didn’t sign up. Instead, I chose to live within walking distance of my workplace, an economic privilege that many disabled people in this city don’t have. This wasn’t necessarily the easy option. My office at the time was located in Union Square, in a Manhattan neighborhood that ranks among the highest in the city in median rents. On top of that, I had to find an apartment that wasn’t a walk-up, that didn’t have steps at the entrance and that didn’t have a closet-sized bathroom. In bad weather, I had to take a taxi or Uber to work. My decision to avoid Access-A-Ride has eaten into my budget. But the anxiety saved seemed worth it. Still, I never stopped thinking about Access-A-Ride and the people who have to use it. After joining ProPublica, I decided to see if there was a story worth telling about paratransit services in New York City. I started working with Jess Ramirez, then a reporting fellow on our engagement team, to reach the people who interact with Access-A-Ride: riders, drivers, dispatchers, city officials, advocates, caregivers. We spoke to dozens of people who use Access-A-Ride. We heard from one woman who took Access-A-Ride to work and eventually retired early, in large part because the process was exhausting. A young man told us of trying to take Access-A-Ride to his first day at a new job, only to have the van’s lift break while he was on it. We read dozens of personal injury lawsuits filed related to Access-A-Ride. Audits from the city’s comptroller’s office detailed unaddressed complaints, a faulty discipline system for contractors and a failure to use technology like GPS. We found that the system had suffered from lack of attention and investment by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and that, in recent years, it had grown faster in costs and ridership than the agency was prepared for. The economic impact of this on disabled people extends far beyond missing doctor’s appointments; it means it’s harder to find jobs and housing and save money. And beyond income, it means missing out on seeing friends, going to shows and museums and eating at interesting but out-of-the-way restaurants—many of the things that make living in New York City worth it. The story of a slow, unreliable public transportation system is not an unfamiliar one to most New Yorkers. The city’s subway system is dysfunctional for everyone, its shortcomings regularly covered in the local news media. But for people who use wheelchairs or walkers, the subway is almost unusable. Most of the 472 stations lack elevators, leaving disabled people with limited options to get around. The problems other riders experience every day — delays, overcrowded trains, service changes with no warning — are compounded for people like me who are already limited in which routes we can take. The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, was an attempt to address this problem. Under the law, cities are required to provide alternate transportation to their residents with disabilities who aren’t able to take standard public transportation. The paratransit service must be comparable to what’s available to able-bodied people, operating the same hours and taking riders everywhere that subway and bus routes go. In New York, where the subway is the bedrock of mass transit, providing an above-ground equivalent has always been a challenge. Access-A-Ride is a victim of many of the same obstacles that plague the city’s buses which, subject to the city’s ever-growing traffic, are among the slowest in the country. There are technological improvements that experts say could make Access-A-Ride more efficient, both for riders and for the MTA, but the agency has been slow to update the system. Policymakers often assume that people who use paratransit services aren’t technologically savvy, said Sarah Kaufman, associate director of the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation and lead author of a 2016 report on New York City’s paratransit system. “We simply cannot assume that people who are disabled don’t use technology,” Kaufman said. “But it’s being assumed in [Access-A-Ride’s] technology development.” She said making better use of the app-based and GPS technology that Uber and Lyft have developed would go a long way toward making Access-A-Ride a service that works for everyone. The MTA is starting to take steps in this direction, such as installing GPS in its blue-and-white vans, creating a section within its MyMTA app that riders can use to schedule rides as an alternative to calling and partnering with ride-hailing apps like Curb. But the MTA doesn’t have the money to innovate much beyond the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The agency is already spending unsustainable amounts of cash on the Access-A-Ride program alone. In 2019, the MTA spent $614 million on paratransit services for about 160,000 disabled customers. Each ride in a blue-and-white Access-A-Ride van cost the MTA on average $86, significantly more than the average taxi trip in the city. In a pilot program launched in 2017, the MTA experimented with allowing 1,200 paratransit riders to request taxis on demand through an app. The program was immensely popular with riders, but less popular with the MTA. Even though the cost was much less — on average $40 a ride — riders were using the service more because it worked. MTA officials have said they’re looking at ways to make the program financially sustainable. In November, they expanded the pilot program to 2,400 users but capped the number of on-demand trips each participant is allowed to take at 16 rides a month. Earlier in 2019, Access-A-Ride announced a plan to move toward using taxis and livery vehicles, which advocates said is a step in the right direction. But the transition had a rocky rollout, leading to rider complaints about late or no-show vehicles. The paratransit service would be less overburdened, of course, if the subway were more accessible. Only a quarter of the stations have elevators, which makes it, proportionally, less accessible than the subway systems in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., according to TransitCenter, a transit advocacy organization. Even at the stations the MTA deems accessible, constantly broken elevators, wide gaps between the train and platform, and unannounced service changes make the subway difficult to use for people with disabilities. There were 14,092 subway elevator outages in 2015, according to the Rudin Center. In a second report published in 2017, the authors analyzed Access-A-Ride ride data, finding that in 2015, trips that started or ended near non-accessible subway stations cost a total of $258 million. If even some of those stations were made accessible, that would result in long-term savings for the MTA. The MTA had begun making accessibility more of a priority under a new head of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, who appointed Alex Elegudin, a wheelchair user, to a new position as senior adviser for accessibility. Under Byford’s Fast Forward plan, launched in 2018, at least 50 subway stations would be made accessible over five years; last September, the MTA raised the goal to 70 stations. In January, though, Byford resigned after months of tension between him and the governor, Andrew Cuomo. Many of the the accessibility improvements that Byford championed are now part of the MTA’s new five-year capital plan, but transit experts and rider advocates say the loss of such a vocal advocate has left them uneasy about the fate of the agenda Byford laid out during his short tenure. For many people with disabilities, most of New York City is a transit desert. The economic impact is severe, advocates say. The employment rate for people with disabilities in the city is 35% versus 74% for those without disabilities . Some of those people can’t work for reasons unrelated to transportation. But a truly accessible public transportation system, whether through Access-A-Ride or the subway or a combination of the two, would go a long way toward reducing that disparity.

California’s 2019 reclassification of gig workers such as ride hail app drivers as employees put the spotlight on New York, the next largest labor-friendly state. Few expected that Albany would pass major legislation reclassifying workers this year, but momentum was building. Hearings were held, and multiple bills were introduced taking varied approaches to deciding whether gig workers should remain classified as independent contractors, be reclassified as employees or be granted employment benefits in some other way. In his January budget proposal, Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a task force to study how gig workers should be classified and make recommendations by May 1 – or leave it to the state Department of Labor to introduce new regulations on its own. Dueling coalitions representing labor groups and gig companies were gearing up for a lobbying battle in Albany. By 2021, it seemed, the state might actually pass one of those bills. You can probably guess what happened next: the coronavirus pandemic blew up the legislative agenda, bringing that momentum to a halt. When the Legislature passed a budget in April, it left out Cuomo’s task force proposal . Despite the fact that gig workers for companies such as Instacart and Grubhub found themselves on the frontlines of the pandemic, delivering food and groceries to those able to work from home, comprehensive reform to grant those workers benefits like paid sick leave or overtime fell off the agenda. Nonetheless, labor advocates are encouraged by a recent slate of small steps to grant those workers traditional benefits and by their belief that the financial stresses of the pandemic highlighted the need to change the rules for gig workers – potentially building political momentum for reclassification. A handful of court rulings this spring and summer affirmed that gig workers in certain industries should be considered employees for the purposes of receiving unemployment insurance. State Sen. Diane Savino, who was one of the first to introduce legislation to change gig workers’ classification, and who held a hearing on the issue last fall, said that when the conversation over gig workers began a few years ago, some weren’t sure whether these app-based workers would need the same protections as employees. “A lot of people thought, ‘Well, maybe they don't need it in this new world,’ and that people can go out and make their own way and be masters of their own universe,’” she recalled. “And then the pandemic came and knocked everybody on their ass.” While gig workers in New York are broadly classified as independent contractors – meaning they work for themselves and aren’t eligible for traditional employment benefits – two court rulings this year add some nuance. In March, just days after New York entered its pandemic lockdown, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that Postmates delivery workers could receive unemployment benefits. The court found that the relationship between a former Postmates driver and the platform did in fact constitute an employer-employee relationship, despite the company’s claims that its workers are self-employed. Then, in July, a federal judge in New York ruled that the state must begin paying unemployment benefits to Uber and Lyft drivers, affirming a 2018 ruling that Uber drivers and other “similarly situated” drivers should be considered employees for the purposes of unemployment insurance. The two court rulings are limited in the kind of benefits they extend and address only two kinds of gig workers. They don’t suddenly make Uber drivers eligible for overtime pay or give Postmates workers the right to organize. They also hold no immediate impacts for on-demand dog walkers or handymen. But together, union and labor leaders say they are an important first step of recognizing that these kinds of app-based gig workers should be considered employees for the purposes of all employment benefits. “If you’re an employee, you’re not just an employee for one particular right,” said Mario Cilento, president of the New York State AFL-CIO. “You can’t be a little pregnant. Either you’re an employee or you’re not.” Cilento said that he now wants to see those rulings codified by the state and apply to all kinds of benefits. Some state lawmakers have expressed interest in reclassifying gig workers as employees, while others have tried to find solutions for granting workers more benefits without going that far. But Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said that these court rulings make such a “third way” approach unrealistic. “I think that those court decisions were a real game changer,” Desai said. “Now, if the Legislature wants to pass a watered down, third way bill – as the companies have been lobbying for – there's no question that they would be taking away benefits from gig workers that have been established by the courts.” But even those who believe gig workers in New York deserve a comprehensive policy change admit that the state would be on dangerous ground if it simply followed in the footsteps of states that have triggered a cascade of lawsuits and unintentionally harmed some freelancers. The best-known example of a state reclassifying gig workers as employees is in California, where a recently passed law doing so has resulted in a series of court challenges, including from Uber and Lyft. When a California judge ruled in August that the companies had to comply with the law and start classifying their drivers as employees, both companies threatened that the order would force them to shut down in order to retool their business models. But just before a shutdown was set to begin, an appeals court granted the companies a reprieve that delays the requirement to reclassify their workers while the companies appeal the ruling. Known as “AB5,” this new California law uses a more stringent method of worker classification and ends up reclassifying many gig workers as employees. It uses what’s called an “ABC test,” under which a worker is only classified as an independent contractor if they are (1) free from the control of their employer, (2) doing work outside the usual course of business of an employer and (3) engaged in an independently established business. For example, an accountant who runs her own firm and is retained by a non-accounting business to do its taxes would still be an independent contractor. But, under this test, most app-based gig platforms would have to start treating their drivers, couriers and task-doers as employees. When it passed in California, it garnered ferocious opposition from companies including Uber, Lyft and Doordash. The financial cost of treating workers as employees, which would include providing them with health insurance, would be massive . The companies say there are other ways to grant their workers employment benefits without fundamentally altering their business models. Some have proposed creating portable benefits programs for their workers. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times calling for gig companies to contribute to benefits funds that their workers could use for the benefits that they want. Uber and Lyft have both released polls showing broad support for this kind of plan among drivers and others currently classified as independent contractors. AB5 hasn’t just been controversial because it upset gig companies, though. Others said that the state’s approach was overly broad. It has been overwhelmingly unpopular with freelance writers, for example, because it bars companies from accepting more than 35 submissions a year from freelancers; any more, and the company would have to treat them as employees. A weekly opinion columnist, who is typically only working one-two days per week on his or her column, would now have to receive a full benefits package. But instead of suddenly hiring up all of their freelancers when the law went into effect in January, some of those companies simply cut back on the work they gave freelancers to get them below the 35-assignment threshold. The fate of AB5 is still in flux. Uber, Lyft and Doordash have raised over $100 million to campaign for a ballot measure that would exempt them from AB5 – keeping workers for companies like theirs classified as independent contractors, while requiring the companies to start paying for some employment benefits for their workers, such as minimum wage and health care contributions. Californians will vote on that measure this November. Though much of the focus of the gig worker issue has been on AB5 in California, a similar debate has taken shape in New York over the past few years, though to much less fanfare. Multiple pieces of legislation have been introduced in Albany that would change how app-based gig companies have to treat their workers. State Sen. Robert Jackson and Assembly Member Deborah Glick introduced a bill last fall that would classify workers under an ABC test, similar to AB5. Before that, Savino and Assembly Member Marcos Crespo introduced legislation last spring that would create a third classification of worker – a “dependent worker” – which would capture app-based gig workers and extend to this group the right to organize and collectively bargain, along with other protections. Groups on both sides of the issue have coalesced to promote their interests in Albany as the debate heated up. The NY Do It Right Employment Classification Test (DIRECT) Coalition, which is made up of labor groups including the New York Taxi Workers Alliance and 32BJ SEIU, favors a full reclassification solution using an ABC test. On the other end of the spectrum is the Flexible Work for New York coalition, which is made up of business industry groups and individual gig companies such as Grubhub and TaskRabbit. This group argued that what gig workers value is their flexible work schedules and that classifying them as employees would eliminate the ability to work whenever or wherever they want. The fact that New York’s gig worker debate has taken place in the shadow of California’s controversial AB5 saga means that lawmakers have proceeded cautiously. Even those who say they favor an ABC test acknowledge that New York has to be careful to avoid California’s pitfalls. Rafael Espinal, the former City Council Member who now serves as president of the Freelancers Union, has been paying especially close attention to California’s efforts. “I think it's important that the bill sponsors here in New York take a closer look and learn from the lessons, and make sure that whatever moves forward has the best interests of all parties in mind,” Espinal said. “We understand that there are misclassified workers, and we support any effort to deal with that issue, but we also have to ensure that professional freelancers and the freelance workforce as a whole is not hurt through unintended consequences.” But even though California’s gig worker debate is arguably more fraught than ever, the pandemic is adding a new urgency for New York to address gig worker rights now. “I just feel like we’re, as a country, collectively guilty of appalling hypocrisy,” said New York City Council Member Brad Lander. “We stood out on our stoops and cheered at 7 every night. We were cheering for a lot of people – doctors and nurses and grocery store workers – but the ones most likely to actually go down the block while we were cheering were restaurant delivery workers.” This spring, Lander introduced legislation that would use a modified ABC test to make New York City gig workers entitled to paid sick leave, noting the risk that the majority of these workers faced during a public health crisis. While workers classified as independent contractors received federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, they were left out of New York’s emergency paid sick leave legislation. In the spring, some gig companies began offering paid sick leave because of the pandemic, but critics say workers shouldn’t be reliant on the goodwill of companies to receive ad hoc benefits. And the status quo creates a public health risk. If a delivery worker, for example, has COVID-19 but goes to work because they can’t use paid sick leave, they could end up spreading the virus. Using examples like app-based couriers delivering food to people in quarantine or Amazon Flex workers delivering packages amid a surge in online shopping, Lander also noted that a lack of employment protections hits already-marginalized communities especially hard. “In the context of the racial reckoning, (there’s) a real understanding that we’re talking overwhelmingly about workers of color, and yet we’ve just totally failed to show up for them and provide them even the basics of paid sick leave – much less the broader set of benefits that workers need, in terms of health care, retirement security and workers comp,” he said. Lander’s paid sick leave legislation still has not progressed in the Council, but he pointed to Council Speaker Corey Johnson when asked about the delay. “Legislation in the City Council moves forward when the speaker moves it forward,” Lander said. “To me, it’s now like the City Council has denied these workers paid sick leave that we could be giving them.” A representative for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Even if that legislation does pass, it won’t be the complete solution that gig workers need, Lander said. “We need that big comprehensive change at the state level,” he said. “This was designed, in part, to be a step to build momentum for it. Paid sick leave is the one area that we have figured out that the city could implement on its own. In other areas of employment law, we’re preempted.” Jackson, the sponsor of the state bill that would create an ABC test for workers, echoed the notion that the pandemic only makes the need for reclassification more clear. “So many home healthcare workers, app-based drivers, nail salon workers, childcare providers, and other so-called ‘freelancers’ have been left out in the cold when it comes to unemployment benefits and workplace protections,” he said in an emailed comment. “The need to reclassify these workers as ‘employees’ is more urgent now than ever before, and I continue to work on legislation that addresses those needs.” Meanwhile, some of those fighting against attempts to reclassify New York’s gig workers as employees readily admit the fact that the pandemic has brought these workers’ lack of protections into harsh light, but say that the state can create a new way to grant those benefits without requiring reclassification. “Everyone agrees that workers deserve benefits and protections, but there are many wrong ways to pursue a worthwhile goal,” Ryan Naples, deputy director at Tech:NYC, a technology industry group whose members include gig companies such as Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Handy, wrote over email. “Just as California is dealing with the consequences of capriciously reclassifying millions of workers, so too could New York create a mess for itself without a thoughtful, flexible framework.” Though the state Legislature has been largely silent on the gig worker issue during the pandemic, Savino hinted that new legislation may be forthcoming. While she wouldn’t detail what a new approach would look like, she acknowledged that both the pandemic and the recent court rulings on Postmates, Uber and Lyft, have changed the conversation. “We’re certainly taking a different look at it than we were in January,” she said.

Even if that legislation does pass, it won’t be the complete solution that gig workers need, Lander said. “We need that big comprehensive change at the state level,” he said. “This was designed, in part, to be a step to build momentum for it. Paid sick leave is the one area that we have figured out that the city could implement on its own. In other areas of employment law, we’re preempted.” Jackson, the sponsor of the state bill that would create an ABC test for workers, echoed the notion that the pandemic only makes the need for reclassification more clear. “So many home healthcare workers, app-based drivers, nail salon workers, childcare providers, and other so-called ‘freelancers’ have been left out in the cold when it comes to unemployment benefits and workplace protections,” he said in an emailed comment. “The need to reclassify these workers as ‘employees’ is more urgent now than ever before, and I continue to work on legislation that addresses those needs.” Meanwhile, some of those fighting against attempts to reclassify New York’s gig workers as employees readily admit the fact that the pandemic has brought these workers’ lack of protections into harsh light, but say that the state can create a new way to grant those benefits without requiring reclassification. “Everyone agrees that workers deserve benefits and protections, but there are many wrong ways to pursue a worthwhile goal,” Ryan Naples, deputy director at Tech:NYC, a technology industry group whose members include gig companies such as Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Handy, wrote over email. “Just as California is dealing with the consequences of capriciously reclassifying millions of workers, so too could New York create a mess for itself without a thoughtful, flexible framework.” Though the state Legislature has been largely silent on the gig worker issue during the pandemic, Savino hinted that new legislation may be forthcoming. While she wouldn’t detail what a new approach would look like, she acknowledged that both the pandemic and the recent court rulings on Postmates, Uber and Lyft, have changed the conversation. “We’re certainly taking a different look at it than we were in January,” she said.

The struggles faced by LGBTQ communities, including high rates of homelessness , significant health disparities , high rates of poverty , and increased likelihood of violent victimization compared with heterosexual and cisgender peers, are amplified by current socioeconomic strains. For Black LGBTQ people, these vulnerabilities are compounded by the violence of anti-Black racism and white supremacy, urging specific attention to the effects of structural racism in housing policy during a public health crisis like COVID-19. On June 12, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed a new rule that would overturn 2016 transgender nondiscrimination protections and allow single-sex homeless shelters to discriminate against transgender people by making placement and accommodation decisions based on a person’s assigned sex at birth rather than their gender identity. This is particularly concerning for the safety and well-being of young transgender women of color , who are especially vulnerable to severe marginalization, hostility, and violence in shelters not designed for the LGBTQ community. Black people make up a disproportionate share , 40 percent, of the homeless population despite representing only 13 percent of the general US population, and new data shows that the pandemic is widening housing disparities by race and income. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experiencing homelessness face increased exposure to the coronavirus, and national data show severe racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates necessitating a focus on housing justice. The Black LGBTQ community is especially vulnerable to housing and economic instability LGBTQ housing issues can start early in life, and facing them at pivotal moments in education and employment trajectories can impede future economic well-being, mental and physical health, and stability. Because of familial and social rejection based on gender identity and sexual orientation, LGBTQ young adults are at more than double the risk of homelessness compared to non-LGBTQ peers.  An estimated 30 percent of youth in foster care and 40 percent of youth experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQ. Black LGBTQ youth are significantly overrepresented among this group. According to the 2015 US Transgender Survey (PDF), Black transgender people face the most severe economic and housing effects among LGBTQ communities: 20 percent were unemployed , twice the rate among Black people in the general US population (10 percent) and four times the rate of the general US population (5 percent) 38 percent were experiencing poverty , more than three times the rate of the general US population (12 percent) 42 percent had experienced homelessness in their lives , compared with 30 percent in the overall sample 22 percent had experienced homelessness in the past year specifically because they are transgender 40 percent experienced some form of housing discrimination or instability , including eviction or being denied a home or apartment because they are transgender Addressing structural risk factors, such as chronic homelessness and housing insecurity, is key to creating safe communities where Black LGBTQ people can thrive. Antitransgender violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color (PDF) and is fueled by antitransgender stigma, including lack of family acceptance and hostile political climates; denial of opportunity, including exclusion from health care and structural inequities in policing; and increased risk factors, including poverty and homelessness. So far in 2020 , at least 12 transgender or gender nonconforming people have been killed, and the recent killings of Black transgender women, including Nina Pop, Riah Milton, and Dominique “Rem’mie” Fells, and the police killing of a Black transgender man named Tony McDade, amplify the need for policy change and action to protect Black transgender lives. Following leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement, discussions of housing and homelessness during the COVID-19 crisis present opportunities to center the vulnerabilities faced by Black LGBTQ—especially transgender—people. Although LGBTQ people face a range of intersecting socioeconomic struggles during the COVID-19 crisis —and many will experience direct health effects from the coronavirus itself—the immediate impact of housing instability demands specific attention. The pandemic exacerbates inequities in housing stability, homelessness rates, and shelter access The pandemic has had a marked impact on LGBTQ people’s economic well-being : 38 percent of LGBTQ people of color have had work hours reduced, compared with 29 percent of white LGBTQ people and 24 percent of the general population. Black and Latinx people are twice as likely as white people to be renters and pay a higher share of their income on rent in most major metropolitan areas. Fourteen percent of LGBTQ people of color have asked to delay rent payments , compared with 8 percent of white LGBTQ people and 7 percent of the general population, suggesting Black and Latinx LGBTQ people will be most affected when federal eviction protection ends on July 24 . For LGBTQ people facing housing insecurity, shelters are a key support. As the pandemic began, LGBTQ shelters across the country reported significant increases in intake . Washington, DC’s Casa Ruby reports that intake tripled during the first month of the pandemic. As shelters adjust their practices to facilitate social distancing and comply with guidelines, many have had to significantly reduce capacity . Many residents worry LGBTQ shelters won’t have enough available beds, forcing people to live in a “traditional” and possibly queerphobic or transphobic shelter environment or be unsheltered, increasing their risk of COVID-19 exposure. As systems and institutions struggle to meet increasing demand and confront structural inequities, community organizations like Gays and Lesbians Living in a Transgender Society (GLITS) , Princess Janae Place , the Homeless Black Trans Women Fund , the Black Trans Advocacy Coalition , and SisTers PGH are stepping in to connect Black transgender people with safe housing and shelter. Policies and strategies to address material vulnerabilities faced by the Black LGBTQ community during the pandemic HUD could fully reinstate the Equal Access Rule to protect transgender and gender nonconforming people from being discriminated against by shelters. Lawmakers could include LGBTQ nondiscrimination language in all COVID-19 response legislation (PDF) to protect queer people against discrimination in residential treatment facilities, long-term care facilities, halfway houses, homeless shelters, and foster care. COVID-19 data collection efforts conducted by local, state, and federal agencies could include voluntary questions on sexual orientation and gender identity to ensure COVID-19’s impact on the LGBTQ community is recorded. Organizations serving LGBTQ populations need flexible funding that is responsive to individual organizations’ current needs and capacity . Increased demand on LGBTQ centers and shelters is a major challenge for organizations facing reduced capacity because of social distancing. A portion of funding from the CARES Act , including the $4 billion allocated for Emergency Solutions Grants, could be intentionally directed towards LGBTQ organizations that serve people experiencing homelessness. Other government channels and private donors could provide more financial support to LGBTQ-serving organizations and community centers. Community members and LGBTQ organizations are organizing mutual aid funds , which many consider critical right now for both LGBTQ people who do not have access to federal relief funds and those for whom this aid is insufficient. These mutual aid funds often target hyper-local needs, and funds across the nation (such as those in this resource compiled by Annika Hansteen-Izora and this index by Autostraddle) are looking for substantive financial support. These recommendations target the general LGBTQ population, holding promise to benefit the Black LGBTQ community and other queer communities of color. But we also need COVID-19 policies and interventions with explicit racial justice frames on key issues such as eviction to adequately address Black LGBTQ people’s needs. The intersecting crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ housing insecurity, and anti-Black racism present an opportunity to critically consider how American society can be rebuilt to advance equity, redress harm, and combat white supremacist structures and institutions.

Credit... Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press By J. David Goodman May 2, 2018 If New York City’s goal was to reduce racial segregation to the maximum extent possible, would you reserve half of all new affordable housing units for people who already live in a given neighborhood? The question, posed to Vicki Been, who ran much of the city’s affordable housing program until early last year, drew a curious answer. “I don’t think so,” she said. Nonetheless, the city has adhered to that policy, in large part because of City Council members who would simply reject new affordable housing if it did not advantage their local constituents, Ms. Been and others explained in deposition excerpts filed in federal court late Tuesday. For nearly three years, the city has been fighting a lawsuit filed on behalf of three black women from Brooklyn and Queens who said they were not given a fair shot to win affordable apartments in city-run housing lotteries because of the policy that gives current neighborhood residents preference in half of all such units. The goal of the lawsuit is to alter the policy so that all New Yorkers who apply for affordable housing are given the same shot. City lawyers have tried to keep many of the materials in the case under seal; in one example, the city persuaded a judge last year to seal a study, commissioned by the plaintiffs, that examined the racial effects of the local preference in housing lotteries.

By: Jaime Weisberg Jaime Weisberg Key Findings Key Findings People of color – particularly Black and Latino – and low- and moderate-income people are being locked out of homeownership in New York City. Racial disparities in lending persist, and are getting worse – 22% of New York City’s population is Black and 29% is Hispanic, yet fewer than 7.6% of all loans went to Black borrowers and 7.9% to Hispanic- a lower rate for both from the prior four years. Non-bank lenders are increasing their presence overall, and particularly to borrowers of color and in neighborhoods of color, while banks are retreating from lending to and in those communities , placing these communities at a greater risk of paying higher costs and making them vulnerable to risky behavior (as non-bank lenders have fewer oversights than CRA-regulated banks). The 2017 HMDA data analyzed by ANHD reveals the continuation of troubling trends noted in prior white papers . Fair lending laws and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), were passed over 40 years ago to address the practice of redlining and disinvestment by both government and financial institutions. HMDA was created soon after in order to enforce fair lending laws and help fight against the systematic denial of access for people of color to homeownership and banking. HMDA is one of the most important tools the government and the public has to analyze the home mortgage market. Through HMDA, we can evaluate residential lending overall and by individual lenders to better understand who is, and isn’t, getting access to credit and identify patterns of discrimination. HMDA data is available down to the census tract, enabling the public to evaluate the market at a very local level. Under HMDA, most bank and nonbank lenders must disclose a wide range of information regarding their mortgage lending activity, including: Loan Data: property type (1-4 family, multifamily, manufactured housing); loan purpose (home purchase, refinance, home improvement); loan type (conventional, FHA, VA); property location (census tract, including income level and demographics); and if the loan was a “high-cost” or subprime loan Applicant Data: race, ethnicity, income, and gender of each applicant and co-applicant Outcomes: whether the loan was approved, denied, withdrawn, etc. HMDA data is one key piece of a bank’s CRA evaluation, which measures how well the bank is meeting the credit needs of low-and moderate income (LMI) people and neighborhoods where the bank operates. Yet, despite its origins, the CRA is “color-blind,” such that banks are not evaluated on their record of serving people and communities of color. Following the 2008 financial crisis, congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (commonly known as the “Dodd-Frank Act”) , which contained numerous provisions around liquidity and capital requirements, and types of activities banks can engage in to safeguard the country from another financial collapse. The law also put in place numerous consumer protection provisions and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which consolidates the enforcement of numerous consumer protection laws under one agency and gives that agency the power to hold financial institutions accountable to discriminatory or harmful practices, including fair lending violations. As part of that mission, the Dodd Frank Act included a mandate to expand the data collected under HMDA to better understand the mortgage market, capture more loans, and uncover harmful practices . The final rules expanded the types of loans reportable under HMDA, including CEMA loans, which are very common for multifamily mortgage refinancing, but are used in 1-4 family as well, as a way to reduce mortgage recording taxes. 2 The rules also include additional data to better understand the types and characteristics of lending that led to the financial crisis, or may do so in the future. These include home equity loans; home equity lines of credit; reverse mortgages; manufactured housing; new data on underwriting criteria, such as debt to income ratios, credit scores, and improved disclosure of loan terms and pricing; and disaggregated race and ethnicity information that better reflects the diversity within the Hispanic, Asian, and Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander populations. These are critical to better uncover discrimination and disparate lending patterns. As comprehensive and powerful as HMDA is, it is incomplete and allows for many lenders to not be held accountable for their lending practices. For example, HMDA has long exempted CEMA loans, which make up a significant volume of loans in New York, and particularly multifamily loans. As mentioned above, under Dodd Frank, CEMA loans will be reported starting in 2018 along with the new data points, but what will not change is the exemption of lenders that do not make any 1-4 family home loans, regardless of the number of multifamily loans they make. And Dodd Frank went on to exempt lenders that make fewer than 25 loans for two years in a row. Even before the expanded data collection went into effect, the new data collection was rolled back considerably under the recently passed “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,” also known as S.2155. This bill exempts lenders making 500 or fewer loans from reporting on the expanded data fields, thus shielding as much as 85% of lenders from additional public scrutiny necessary to root out disparities and fraud. Low- and Moderate-Income People Are Locked Out of Homeownership Low- and Moderate-Income People Are Locked Out of Homeownership Home purchase lending has risen steadily over the past four years, up 12% from 2014 to 2017 and 3.5% from 2016 to 2017. The amount loaned increased at an even faster pace, and yet, the number and percentage of loans to LMI borrowers has been declining. This is somewhat understandable, given the high and rising cost of housing in New York City; sales prices have been increasing steadily for the past six years. In 2017, sales prices increased 11% for single-family homes and 14% for 2-4 family homes.5 Meanwhile, in 2016, 44% of homeowners that already had a mortgage were rent-burdened, paying more than 30% of their income on housing. That being said, some lower-income borrowers were getting loans by banks and non-banks, but there is more banks can do to reach these borrowers today through products, financial assistance, outreach, and partnerships. Under the CRA, banks are evaluated on the volume of their home lending, and the percentage of “CRA loans,” which are loans to LMI borrowers and loans in LMI tracts. This has led to the creation of affordable “CRA loan” products, fostered innovative partnerships, and increased staff resources dedicated to expanding lending to meet their obligations. CRA loan products are available to people in the banks’ assessment areas that meet either criteria. Banks that take this most seriously will offer a range of CRA products, including portfolio products and governmentbacked loans with a low down payment requirement, financial assistance, flexible underwriting, and they will form partnerships with nonprofit organizations that provide homeownership counseling. While certainly some of the CRA loan products are going to LMI borrowers, we note that many middleand upper-income borrowers are getting loans by CRA-covered banks to purchase homes in LMI tracts. Regardless of which product they use, banks get credit for the loans, and this means that many of these CRA loans are not benefiting the people that the law was intended to support and could in fact be contributing to gentrification and displacement as banks get CRA credit for all loans in LMI tracts. Although some middle-income borrowers can use assistance in a high-cost market like New York City, there are often no limits on the income of the borrower for CRA products in LMI tracts. This is particularly concerning in areas that are already gentrifying rapidly, such as parts of Northern and Central Brooklyn.6 But, we are also seeing this trend in areas like East New York and upper Manhattan, which are going through rezonings and beginning to experience higher displacement pressures. These are just a few examples of areas where local residents increasingly cannot afford to buy homes in their own communities. In East New York, for example, the median income was $38,620 in 2016 ($3,017 per month), but the median sales price per unit that year was $412,000 for a single-family home and $245,201 for 2-4 family home. To afford a home for $412,000, with a 20% down payment, a family would have to earn nearly double that income and have $82,400 to put down. But, given the high cost of living in New York City – childcare, clothing, food, as well as the cost of maintaining such a home – a family would likely need to earn well above even double that income to afford a home at this price. A person can’t afford a $412,000 home on a $38,620 per year salary. Similarly, we also note that very few loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers are in lower-income tracts, especially ones that are rapidly gentrifying and where displacement pressures on those families are growing, such as Williamsburg and Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and upper Manhattan. Racial Disparities Persist and Are Getting Worse Racial Disparities Persist and Are Getting Worse Twenty-two percent of New York City’s population is Black and 29% is Hispanic, yet fewer than 8% of all loans went to either group – figures that are below the prior four years. The denial rates – which refers to the percentage of applications that were denied by the lender9 – for Black and Hispanic borrowers continue to be higher than the rates of White and Asian borrowers, while origination rates are consistently lower, which refers to the percentage of applications that resulted in a loan being made. In 2017, 72% of loans to White and Asian borrowers were originated versus 61% of loans to Black borrowers and 65% of loans to Hispanic borrowers. Similarly, just 10% of loans to White borrowers and 12% to Asians were denied, versus 17% of loans to Black borrowers and 14% to Hispanics. These all changed very little from 2016. That’s not to say there isn’t racial disparities within the Asian communities when it comes to lending. One of the changes to HMDA under Dodd Frank was to disaggregate the Asian and Pacific Islander category in order to establish a more nuanced understanding of mortgage lending and loan performance patterns across different Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.10 That has not yet gone into effect. Because there are great variations and disparities within the “Asian” category, including vastly different populations, the data makes it appear as though there is over-lending to this population (Asians make up 14% of the population, but received 28% of home purchase loans). Therefore, there may be more unequal lending practices than there appears. Similar to trends we see with low- and moderate-income borrowers, very few loans to Black borrowers are in lowand moderate-income tracts in gentrifying neighborhoods. Hispanic borrowers are more dispersed, but the volume of lending to both Black and Hispanic populations is well below that of Whites. Black borrowers seem concentrated in just a few predominantly Black neighborhoods, but notably absent are new loans in predominantly Black neighborhoods that are known to be gentrifying, such as Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights. New York City Home Purchase Loans in 2017 White Borrowers vs. Black Borrowers vs. Hispanic Borrowers Infographic Infographic CRA-Regulated Banks Are Not Meeting the Credit Needs of Borrowers Of Color for Homeownership Loans The starkest difference is in the percentage of CRA-regulated bank loans versus non-bank loans to Black and Hispanic borrowers. CRA-Regulated Banks Are Not Meeting the Credit Needs of Borrowers of Color – Nonbanks Are Filling In the Gaps, Mostly FHA Loans CRA-Regulated Banks Are Not Meeting the Credit Needs of Borrowers of Color – Nonbanks Are Filling In the Gaps, Mostly FHA Loans The percentage of non-bank lenders making home purchase lending is rising steadily in New York City, but it is still below nationwide levels at 56%.11 While this paper focuses on home purchase lending, we must note the rise in non-bank lenders in refinance lending where the percentages in New York City were much higher, matching national trends. Now, non-banks make up over 56% of all refinance loans, up from 42% in 2014. The rise in non-bank lenders, particularly to borrowers of color, is concerning for a number of reasons. Non-banks are not nearly as heavily regulated as banks are. First and foremost, they do not have the same safety and soundness requirements that banks have. Under the CRA, banks are additionally required to make all of their CRA loans – to LMI borrowers and in LMI tracts – in a safe and sound manner. Also, non-banks do not have access to low-cost deposits like banks do and must rely upon other sources of capital, often short-term financing. Those other sources of capital can leave the financial system vulnerable since non-banks may have to act more aggressively to deliver higher rates of return for investors. If the CRA had an affirmative obligation to serve borrowers of color, banks would have an added incentive to be more proactive in lending to borrowers of color and those borrowers wouldn’t have to rely so heavily on non-bank lenders. Three of the top 10 home purchase lenders in 2017 were non-bank lenders as were five of the top 10 refinance lenders. Quicken Loans once again made the most refinance loans in the city and Nationstar was third. Freedom Mortgage made the top 10 for both home purchase and refinance loans. Perhaps due to the CRA’s obligation to lend to LMI borrowers, the percentage of loans to LMI borrowers is on par or higher at banks when compared to non-banks. In 2017, banks made a higher percentage of their loans to LMI borrowers than nonbanks did; 7.3% of all bank loans were to LMI borrowers versus 6.5% of nonbank lenders. In 2016, the percentages were almost the same among the two lender types: 8.3% at banks versus 8.5% at nonbanks. However, the difference in lending to borrowers of color and in communities of color is stark. It raises questions about fair lending, and underscores the need for better enforcement and new strategies to increase lending to underserved populations, including modernizing the CRA to include an affirmative obligation to serve borrowers of color. In 2017, for example, just 3.8% of CRAcovered bank loans went to Black borrowers and 5.4% to Hispanic borrowers, versus 17% and 14%, respectfully, at non-banks. Credit unions were in the middle, but their overall volume of lending is much lower. Not surprisingly, the distribution of loans made by non-bank lenders largely matches lending to borrowers of color, particularly Black neighborhoods in southeast Queens and parts of Brooklyn. ( See Methodology & Additional Data for the breakdown of loans by the Top 10 Banks and Non-Banks. ) The CRA was passed in 1977 as a response to the racist policy of redlining and other discriminatory practices. Generations of racist policies and bias contribute to the racial wealth gap that persists today and play a major factor in the ability to purchase a home – lower earnings, less wealth, and lower credit scores, to name a few. Immigrants may face additional barriers, including language and cultural challenges as well as the lack of a credit score. According to a Pew Research Center study in 2014, the net worth of White households is 13 times that of Black households and 10 times that of Hispanic households.12 The Fiscal Policy Institute found that on average White families in New York State earned 77% more than Black families and 93% more than Hispanic families.13 This is in addition to outright discrimination and implicit bias in lending, such as the stories and data in a Reveal article and related study published earlier this year. Despite this history, the law is color-blind and has not had a meaningful impact on the populations harmed by such policies. Our analysis shows that borrowers of color are disproportionately underrepresented in CRA loans, which as described earlier, are loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers or loans in low- and moderate-income tracts. Just 9% of loans made by CRA-covered banks to low- and moderate-income borrowers were Black and 12% were Hispanic. This is only slightly above the percentage of loans to Black and Hispanic borrowers citywide. In low- and moderate-income tracts, the percentage of loans by CRA-covered banks dropped to 5.8% to Black borrowers and 8.3% to Hispanic borrowers. The percentage of loans made by non-banks to Black and Hispanic borrowers was slightly higher among low- and moderate-income borrowers (9.6% to Black borrowers and 14% to Hispanic borrowers) and much higher among loans in low- and moderate-income tracts (18% to Black borrowers and 20% to Hispanic borrowers). Percentage of Loans to Borrowers of Color Among “CRA loans” CRA Loans are Loans to LMI Borrowers and Loans in LMI Tracts – There is Overlap One of the primary reasons for the disparities among banks and non-banks is that banks have all but pulled out of offering loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which are the predominant source of loans for borrowers of color. But banks have not replaced that product or their approach in order to meet the credit needs of borrowers of color. A recent report by the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) goes in-depth into this twotiered system where borrowers of color are locked out of conventional mortgages and left with FHA loans.15 While FHA loans can be an important source of access due to lower down payment requirements and lower credit scores, they are also often more expensive than conventional mortgages, largely due to the private mortgage insurance that lasts at least 11 years and in some cases for the life of the loan. The CRL report also points out that additional requirements made by individual lenders (known as “lender overlays”) that require higher credit scores or debt-toincome ratios than the FHA does could be locking people out of the market entirely, which is also likely given the low rates of loans to borrowers of color. Lastly, many borrowers of color are not low- or moderate-income, and may be eligible for conventional loans. FHA loans are not the predatory subprime loans we saw leading up to the housing crisis – the HMDA data shows that many of them just crossed the threshold that classifies them as a highcost category, but the fact remains that they are higher cost than the average loan. The high rate of FHA loans that are not made to low- and moderate- income borrowers raises concerns that some borrowers are not being made aware of other options, or worse, are being steered into this more expensive product when they could qualify for a conventional loan or a lower-cost CRA loan if they meet the requirements. Conclusion Conclusion Responsible homeownership is one important method of asset building that can have positive impacts for generations to come. But, as this report demonstrates, too many people are being left behind in accessing homeownership. Addressing these disparities will require a concerted effort on the part of government, banks, and bank regulators. This report comes at a critical moment as we are 10 years out from the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused by irresponsible lending. Meanwhile, bank regulators are contemplating the biggest overhaul of the CRA in over two decades. Government should invest in creating homeownership opportunities , including but not limited to, building affordable homes to purchase, subsidizing the transfer of distressed mortgages to underserved populations, and investing in community land trusts. Increase access to financial assistance , through both bank funds and government funds for low- and moderate-income people and communities, as well as people of color of all incomes who been locked out of homeownership for a multitude of reasons. Increase access to homeownership and financial counseling. Nonprofit housing counselors have a good understanding of quality programs that responsibly give lower-income people a chance at homeownership. Banks must offer and market a range of products geared towards underserved populations – CRA loan products, SONYMA loans, and FHA loans . CRA loans should be affordable, waive Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), include financial assistance, and connect people to pre-purchase counseling. Banks should also have appropriate staff and resources to outreach, market, and support potential homebuyers. Modernize the CRA . The CRA never should have been color-blind. It should be expanded to have an affirmative obligation to meet the credit needs of people and communities of color. Expand and preserve HMDA . HMDA is the most important transparency tool we have to uncover disparities and discrimination in the mortgage market. The CFPB must swiftly implement and make transparent the new data points. Our legislators should reverse the damage done by S. 2155 so that all HMDA reporting lenders are once again required to report on the expanded data reporting requirements. It is imperative for the City and financial institutions to exhaust all options in order to make affordable rental and homeownership opportunities available to lower-income and minority borrowers. Key Findings People of color – particularly Black and Latino – and low- and moderate-income people are being locked out of homeownership in New York City. Racial disparities in lending persist, and are getting worse – 22% of New York City’s population is Black and 29% is Hispanic, yet fewer than 7.6% of all loans went to Black borrowers and 7.9% to Hispanic- a lower rate for both from the prior four years. Non-bank lenders are increasing their presence overall, and particularly to borrowers of color and in neighborhoods of color, while banks are retreating from lending to and in those communities , placing these communities at a greater risk of paying higher costs and making them vulnerable to risky behavior (as non-bank lenders have fewer oversights than CRA-regulated banks). The 2017 HMDA data analyzed by ANHD reveals the continuation of troubling trends noted in prior white papers . Fair lending laws and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), were passed over 40 years ago to address the practice of redlining and disinvestment by both government and financial institutions. HMDA was created soon after in order to enforce fair lending laws and help fight against the systematic denial of access for people of color to homeownership and banking. HMDA is one of the most important tools the government and the public has to analyze the home mortgage market. Through HMDA, we can evaluate residential lending overall and by individual lenders to better understand who is, and isn’t, getting access to credit and identify patterns of discrimination. HMDA data is available down to the census tract, enabling the public to evaluate the market at a very local level. Under HMDA, most bank and nonbank lenders must disclose a wide range of information regarding their mortgage lending activity, including: Loan Data: property type (1-4 family, multifamily, manufactured housing); loan purpose (home purchase, refinance, home improvement); loan type (conventional, FHA, VA); property location (census tract, including income level and demographics); and if the loan was a “high-cost” or subprime loan Applicant Data: race, ethnicity, income, and gender of each applicant and co-applicant Outcomes: whether the loan was approved, denied, withdrawn, etc. HMDA data is one key piece of a bank’s CRA evaluation, which measures how well the bank is meeting the credit needs of low-and moderate income (LMI) people and neighborhoods where the bank operates.

These include home equity loans; home equity lines of credit; reverse mortgages; manufactured housing; new data on underwriting criteria, such as debt to income ratios, credit scores, and improved disclosure of loan terms and pricing; and disaggregated race and ethnicity information that better reflects the diversity within the Hispanic, Asian, and Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander populations. These are critical to better uncover discrimination and disparate lending patterns.

In East New York, for example, the median income was $38,620 in 2016 ($3,017 per month), but the median sales price per unit that year was $412,000 for a single-family home and $245,201 for 2-4 family home. To afford a home for $412,000, with a 20% down payment, a family would have to earn nearly double that income and have $82,400 to put down. But, given the high cost of living in New York City – childcare, clothing, food, as well as the cost of maintaining such a home – a family would likely need to earn well above even double that income to afford a home at this price. A person can’t afford a $412,000 home on a $38,620 per year salary. Similarly, we also note that very few loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers are in lower-income tracts, especially ones that are rapidly gentrifying and where displacement pressures on those families are growing, such as Williamsburg and Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and upper Manhattan.

A recent report by the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) goes in-depth into this twotiered system where borrowers of color are locked out of conventional mortgages and left with FHA loans.15 While FHA loans can be an important source of access due to lower down payment requirements and lower credit scores, they are also often more expensive than conventional mortgages, largely due to the private mortgage insurance that lasts at least 11 years and in some cases for the life of the loan. The CRL report also points out that additional requirements made by individual lenders (known as “lender overlays”) that require higher credit scores or debt-toincome ratios than the FHA does could be locking people out of the market entirely, which is also likely given the low rates of loans to borrowers of color. Lastly, many borrowers of color are not low- or moderate-income, and may be eligible for conventional loans. FHA loans are not the predatory subprime loans we saw leading up to the housing crisis – the HMDA data shows that many of them just crossed the threshold that classifies them as a highcost category, but the fact remains that they are higher cost than the average loan. The high rate of FHA loans that are not made to low- and moderate- income borrowers raises concerns that some borrowers are not being made aware of other options, or worse, are being steered into this more expensive product when they could qualify for a conventional loan or a lower-cost CRA loan if they meet the requirements. Conclusion Responsible homeownership is one important method of asset building that can have positive impacts for generations to come. But, as this report demonstrates, too many people are being left behind in accessing homeownership. Addressing these disparities will require a concerted effort on the part of government, banks, and bank regulators. This report comes at a critical moment as we are 10 years out from the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused by irresponsible lending. Meanwhile, bank regulators are contemplating the biggest overhaul of the CRA in over two decades. Government should invest in creating homeownership opportunities , including but not limited to, building affordable homes to purchase, subsidizing the transfer of distressed mortgages to underserved populations, and investing in community land trusts. Increase access to financial assistance , through both bank funds and government funds for low- and moderate-income people and communities, as well as people of color of all incomes who been locked out of homeownership for a multitude of reasons. Increase access to homeownership and financial counseling. Nonprofit housing counselors have a good understanding of quality programs that responsibly give lower-income people a chance at homeownership. Banks must offer and market a range of products geared towards underserved populations – CRA loan products, SONYMA loans, and FHA loans . CRA loans should be affordable, waive Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), include financial assistance, and connect people to pre-purchase counseling. Banks should also have appropriate staff and resources to outreach, market, and support potential homebuyers. Modernize the CRA . The CRA never should have been color-blind. It should be expanded to have an affirmative obligation to meet the credit needs of people and communities of color. Expand and preserve HMDA . HMDA is the most important transparency tool we have to uncover disparities and discrimination in the mortgage market. The CFPB must swiftly implement and make transparent the new data points. Our legislators should reverse the damage done by S. 2155 so that all HMDA reporting lenders are once again required to report on the expanded data reporting requirements. It is imperative for the City and financial institutions to exhaust all options in order to make affordable rental and homeownership opportunities available to lower-income and minority borrowers.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations    New York home health aides who have been fighting to get paid for every hour they spend on the job had their hopes dashed Tuesday when the highest court in the state ruled that it’s legal for them to get paid for 13 hours of a 24-hour shift while caring for elderly and disabled people in their homes. The Court of Appeals ruling upheld a controversial minimum wage exemption the state Department of Labor has carved out for round-the-clock home care workers, known as the “13-hour rule.” It’s predicated on the idea that aides typically get eight hours of sleep (at least five of which is uninterrupted) and three hours for meals during a 24-hour shift. But workers say these breaks aren’t always possible given their duties. “I am very angry with this decision,” Lai Yee Chan, a home care worker involved in a class-action lawsuit against her employer, the Chinese-American Planning Council Home Attendant Program, said in Cantonese through a translator. “So are other home care workers who work 24-hour shifts. The court should not listen to the Department of Labor. We need help from the state legislature to make the 24-hour workday illegal." Tuesday’s Court of Appeals ruling reversed lower-court decisions in two class-action lawsuits from 2017 that said the 13-hour rule was illegal. Those rulings could have set a legal precedent that entitled thousands of workers to back-pay and set the stage for them to receive a full 24 hours of pay moving forward, or for 24-hour shifts to be abolished altogether. State Assemblyman Harvey Epstein told Gothamist that he and other legislators who have been following the issue have been waiting to see whether the matter would be resolved in court. Epstein now says he plans to work with advocates to develop legislation that will address the issue, either by banning the 24-hour work day or requiring home care workers to be paid for every hour on the job. “I think we’ll need to look towards other remedies to help these low-income New Yorkers who are mostly women of color who have now been relegated to a position where they are forced to work and not get paid,” Epstein said. Having settled the question of whether the 13-hour rule is valid, the Court of Appeals decision still leaves the door open to class-action lawsuits alleging violations of the policy, which workers say are widespread. It may have therefore done little to dissolve the liability for unpaid wages that some have warned could have devastating effects on the industry that elderly and disabled New Yorkers rely on to remain in their homes. “While the Court of Appeals decision brings clarity on how state policy is interpreted, the risks nevertheless remain, just as they do under any regulation, especially one as complex as this,” said Roger Noyes, a spokesman for the Home Care Association of New York State. Round-the-clock home care workers who testified at a Department of Labor hearing in July said that they routinely have to work through designated sleep and meal breaks and that coordinators at their agencies are not responsive when they report that they don’t get the requisite sleep and meal time under the law. The two cases that were under consideration by the Court of Appeals— Andryeyeva v. New York Health Care and Moreno v. Future Care Health Services —are being remanded back to a lower court to determine whether workers still have valid claims and are justified in suing as a class. Michael Sweeney, an attorney representing the workers in Moreno, said he is confident his clients will still be able to pursue damages, in part because the home care agency didn’t keep adequate records of whether workers were getting their required sleep and meal breaks. “If they want to take 11 hours out of someone’s paycheck, they’re required to keep records,” said Sweeney. “Each of these workers has to use a remote clock-in, clock-out system. [The home care agency] could have easily said, ‘Call and punch out when you go on a sleep break and call when you go back to work,’ but they didn’t.” The state Medicaid program, which insures low-income and disabled New Yorkers, pays for the bulk of 24-hour home care. Eliminating the 13-hour rule would significantly increase costs at a time when Governor Andrew Cuomo is already alarming health care providers by floating measures to keep Medicaid spending down. Increasing the cost of home care could lead to tough decisions about who qualifies for the highest levels of assistance. Susan Dooha, executive director of the New York chapter of the Center for Independence of the Disabled, acknowledges all of that, but said she still sees a need for reform. “We believe in just treatment for home care workers, who are our partners in maintaining our independence,” Dooha said, referring to disabled people seeking to avoid being placed in a nursing home. She said the state should shape the budget based on people’s needs, acknowledging that the population is aging and people with disabilities are living longer, rather than trying to keep spending under the cap Cuomo instituted to keep ballooning Medicaid costs in check. Dooha said the best thing would be to break 24-hour shifts up into two shifts of 12 hours each. “There are certain people with disabilities who have told me that having someone available for 24 hours straight is more beneficial to them,” Dooha said. “But, by and large, a worker is able to do their job better if they have sleep and are able to be more engaged and are not exhausted all the time. Therefore, it’s also a safer situation with better communication for people with disabilities.” JoAnn Lum, an organizer with the labor group the National Mobilization Against Sweat Shops, says the Court of Appeals decision was disheartening but the fight is far from over. “It’s a blow to workers’ rights and to patient care,” she said, “but we will continue to organize even more broadly than ever.” Tagged department of labor department of labor health care health care home care workers home care workers longform longform original original  Caroline Lewis is on the health care beat for WNYC and Gothamist.

Will Waldron, via The Times Union By Troy Closson Published Jan. 26, 2021 Updated April 22, 2021 When New York announced new vaccine eligibility guidelines two weeks ago covering millions of additional state residents, one particularly hard-hit group remained unmentioned: the nearly 50,000 people incarcerated in the state’s prisons and jails . Now, with state supplies dwindling and no clear plan for vaccinating incarcerated people, the virus that tore through the state’s correctional facilities in the spring is roaring back behind bars. At least 5,100 people living and working in New York’s prisons have tested positive and 12 have died in recent weeks, outpacing even the early days of the pandemic. But how and when to vaccinate incarcerated people as millions around the state wait has raised legal, logistical and ethical questions that the state has so far struggled to answer. Across the country, the arrival of a vaccine was hailed as a harbinger of the pandemic’s eventual end. But administering the limited supply has proved challenging, and correctional facilities — where more than half a million people have tested positive for the virus since the start of the pandemic — present additional complications. Officials grappling with the same difficult questions have come to different conclusions, creating a patchwork of policies and timelines that vary dramatically, according to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, a research nonprofit devoted to reducing mass incarceration. But at least 27 states directly name inmates in their public plans, and about a dozen place them in the first phases of vaccine distribution — including Massachusetts, where tens of thousands of prisoners are set to be vaccinated by the end of next month. New Jersey began vaccinating people in prisons in December. Others plan to vaccinate prison and jail workers before incarcerated people, breaking with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends vaccinating everyone at correctional facilities simultaneously.

TeachHub Employees Submit Home About Us Vision and Mission Diversity in Our Schools School Diversity Advisory Group Recommendations School Diversity Advisory Group Recommendations Goals, Metrics and Accountability In the short-term, DOE's goals for diversity at the elementary and middle schools should be based on district demographics, and goals for diversity at high schools should be based on borough demographics. In addition to the goals set by the DOE in its 2017 report, which will be amended based on SDAG recommendations, goals for diversity should be developed by school, district, and community leaders based on the racial, economic, Multilingual Learner (MLL), and Students with Disabilities (SWD) percentages of their community. Short-term and Medium-term: Elementary and middle schools should be measured against their district’s racial, economic, Multilingual Learner (MLL), and Students with Disabilities (SWD) percentages. Upon hitting these targets, individual schools should work towards reaching their borough percentages in the mid-term. Adopted as proposed. Long-term: DOE should aim for all schools to look more like the city. This will encourage the DOE to challenge the neighborhood segregation that exists and support schools in further diversifying their populations In 2017, the DOE set a goal to increase the number of students in a racially representative school. Based on the SDAG’s recommendation, the DOE will expand its definition of representative to include a broad range of racial groups. Racial representation (as defined within the DOE's diversity goals) should consider all races. Previously defined DOE goals focused on percent of Black/Latino students at a school combined. School- and district-level goals for socioeconomic integration should be based upon research. Public diversity goals for socioeconomic integration should incorporate research-backed information about the ideal target for socioeconomic diversity In 2017, the DOE set a goal to increase the number of inclusive schools that serve Emergent Multilingual Learners (MLLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs). All schools should serve MLLs and SWDs; based on the SDAG’s recommendations, the DOE encourages communities, schools, and districts to strive to enroll MLLs and SWDs in proportions close to district averages. MLL and SWD targets should be narrowed (i.e., the goal should be for all schools to have a percentage of MLL/SWD students closer to their district average than what DOE has previously defined as the goal) For schools in economically stratified communities, we should consider other factors beyond poverty to ensure that schools are serving representative populations of students. Adjust goals for schools located in areas with concentrated vulnerability (i.e., for a school in a high poverty district, goals related to socioeconomic diversity will need to be framed differently than in a district with mixed income families) Adopted as proposed. Track and publish a single set of metrics related to diversity in an annual report. NOT ADOPTING Create the position of "Chief Integration Officer" Goals should be developed by communities and districts, and we will support mechanisms for students, parents, and others to reinforce these goals and ensure transparency and progress at the district/community level. Create mechanisms for students to hold the system accountable to the diversity goals Adopted as proposed. Add metrics to the School Quality Report related to diversity and integration Adopted as proposed. Consider incentives to secure charter school commitments to diversity and integration goals Race, Diversity and Enrollment General Strongly support and encourage the nine districts with sufficient demographic diversity of population to develop diversity and integration plans (Districts 1, 2, 3, 13, 15, 22, 27, 28, 31). Require all nine districts with sufficient demographic diversity of population to develop diversity and integration plans (Districts 1, 2, 3, 13, 15, 22, 27, 28, 31). DOE will strongly support and encourage districts to examine different admissions policies and programs as they explore potential changes. The specific programs and policies under consideration may vary by district. Require that districts analyze controlled choice, screens, gifted and talented and other admissions policies and programs in terms of improving or perpetuating schools that are isolated based on race or other factors. (i.e., consider unintended consequences of any new enrollment policy) Adopted as proposed. All admissions fairs and events should be held in fully accessible buildings. Accessibility and Integration of Students with Disabilities Adopted as proposed. All admissions fairs and events should be held in fully accessible buildings. Adopted as proposed. School staff should be trained to welcome and accommodate students and family members with disabilities as well as immigrant families, and students and families who need interpreters on tours and school visits, as well as at school fairs Adopted as proposed. All Family Welcome Center staff should be trained to support students with disabilities and should be prepared to help students consider all school options within their community As the City moves more of its admissions processes online, we have aligned materials to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. As the City moves more of its admissions processes online, all applications should utilize the Universal Design for Learning Framework for presenting information and increasing accessibility. School Diversity Grant Program CONTINUING TO REVIEW Make resources available for any district to receive support for planning diversity, if the DOE receives more applications than the $2 million can support. Adopted as proposed. Permit districts to apply jointly for school diversity planning funds CONTINUING TO REVIEW Consider a separate pot of funds for districts that have not yet begun conversations about integration Adopted as proposed.

Invest in college and career prep resources. Invest in growing and strengthening high-performing schools in communities with historic underinvestment Invest in growing and strengthening high-performing schools outside Manhattan Student Empowerment Adopted as proposed. Every school should have the resources for a high-quality student council Adopted as proposed. Borough Student Advisory Councils should be expanded to include seats for student council representatives from every high school Adopted as proposed. A General Assembly should be created with representatives from every high school to develop a citywide student agenda and vote on key issues Adopted as proposed. The Chancellor’s Student Advisory Committee should be transformed into a leadership body that utilizes youth-adult committees to promote authentic partnership Create a Student Leadership Team, comprised of one student from each BSAC to meet regularly (i.e., quarterly) with the Chancellor Create a Student Leadership Team, comprised of one student from each BSAC to meet monthly with the Chancellor Adopted as proposed. Create a new leadership position within the central DOE office to focus on student voice Adopted as proposed. Create a standing committee on high school admissions to advise the Chancellor in decision-making Pedagogy & Curriculum Adopted as proposed. Provide culturally responsive pedagogical practices at all schools and for all students. Adopted as proposed. Adopt a common definition of Culturally Relevant Education (CRE) that will inform and shape work across the DOE Adopted as proposed. Create partnerships with institutions of higher education to ensure CRE is an essential component of all pre-service teacher training efforts. Adopted as proposed.

Include metrics for accountability related to school climate directly on Quality Review/School-wide Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) Goals. Parent & Teacher Empowerment Adopted as proposed. Utilize varied outreach efforts to meaningfully engage parents in school decision-making processes with the goal of including families that have not participated in prior activities. These may include altering the time, location, setting, or language of the gathering to reflect family needs. Increase availability of information in most common languages other than English about changes to admissions policies and procedures. Ensure families are meaningfully engaged in decisions about changes to admissions policies and procedures in their native language. Increase access to tools related to application and enrollment for families without internet access or a computer at home. Ensure families without internet access or a computer at home are able to utilize all tools related to application and enrollment. Adopted as proposed.

Ensure that Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are translated and provide interpretation and translation support for IEP-related meetings. Adopted as proposed. Support current efforts to share best practices between teachers, administrators and parents on CRE, school climate, and parent empowerment. Create opportunities for all educators, including coaches and school-based mentors, to share best practice across schools, especially as it relates to culturally responsive education. Collaborate with the Division of Teaching and Learning alongside the UFT so that School Based Mentors, Teacher Leaders, Chapter Leaders/Delegates, and Instructional Coaches can participate in the sharing of best practices citywide. Restorative Justice and Practices DOE continues to work through recommendations from the Mayor’s Leadership Team on School Climate and Discipline and will share an update on the recommendations implemented to date. In 2015, the Mayor, in partnership with the DOE, the Police Department, and the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, convened the Mayor’s Leadership Team on School Climate and Discipline. This working group ultimately made a set of recommendations, which are included in this report at a summary level. The SDAG endorses these recommendations and calls upon the DOE and its partner agencies to provide an update on the implementation of these recommendations. Representation To the extent that DOE is able to collect this information in a valid and reliable manner, report on the diversity of school-based staff by position at the district- and city-level, and at the school level where appropriate (considering sufficient numbers).

Max Touhey The latest city budget includes $750,000 to grow an underutilized housing model that creates affordable homes in rapidly gentrifying communities—a major win for housing advocates. The funds will go toward incubating community land trusts (CLTs), or community-based nonprofits that sell housing or other buildings on property but retain ownership of the land. Elected officials and housing advocates tout the unique model as a way to create permanently affordable residential and commercial spaces, but a lack of funding can be a barrier to getting CLTs off the ground. Now, with the injection of dollars from the City Council, newly formed and existing CLTs will have sorely needed support. Manhattan councilmember Carlina Rivera, who is among a coalition of elected officials advocating for CLTs , said the budget win is a “great first step” toward recognizing and investing in the value of CLTs. “We have to use every tool in the tool box and I think this is one that has been dreadfully underutilized for decades,” Rivera told Curbed. “We’re not saying it’s a silver bullet—it’s one of the many things we have to do to address our affordable housing crisis.” By separating ownership of land from what is built on top of it, CLTs ensure that buildings cannot be sold for profit, thereby curbing speculation and serving as bulwarks against displacement and homelessness, advocates say. “We really are looking specifically for neighborhoods that may unfortunately be a part of the next gentrification wave—places like the South Bronx, Brownsville, Staten Island’s north shore,” said Rivera. “What we want to do is plant the seeds for these CLTs to grow.” The effort also has the backing of councilmembers Donovan Richards, Helen Rosenthal, and Mark Levine. The budget funds won’t go toward acquiring property for CLTs, but instead for the technical assistance, educational outreach, and organizing that must occur beforehand. Currently, there are 11 organizations with CLT projects across the five boroughs in neighborhoods such as Harlem, Edgemere, and Cypress Hills. Some incorporated recently are in the process of acquiring land, like the East Harlem El Barrio CLT , while others are in the midst of forming; Chhaya CDC , a nonprofit dedicated to the South Asian Community in Queens, aims to create a CLT in Jackson Heights. CLTs have a long history across the country and New York. The city’s oldest, the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association , dates back to 1991 and is located in Rivera’s district. To date, it has expanded to some 400 apartments and 20 small businesses. Over the years, councilmembers have invested in land trusts in their districts, but the $750,000 will foster a network of CLTs, allowing many of which are in the early phases to mature together. It’s a significant moment, according to Deyanira Del Rio, the board chair of the New York City Community Land Initiative and the co-director of the New Economy Project , which will coordinate the initiative. “It’s really the first of its kind in terms of citywide funding. For us, this feels like a huge step forward—like a leap forward,” said Del Rio. “It’s the first time a lot of these groups are going to have dedicated funding for their CLT organizing work, so it’s pretty powerful.” This is the second bid to fund the initiative. Organizers asked for some $735,000 last year but were unsuccessful. This budget season, advocates pushed for $850,000 to fund the entire program. The NYC Community Land Trust Initiative’s short-term goals include conducting education and organizing sessions for tenants and homeowners; providing technical assistance to emerging CLTs; and formalizing CLT incorporation and partnerships in all five boroughs. The chief long-term goal is to create thousands of units of affordable housing and commercial space for hundreds of small and cooperatively-owned businesses. This is often done by utilizing vacant city land. The model has again gained momentum in New York City in part due to a $3.5 million bank settlement negotiated by then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in 2017. The city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development distributed a $1.65 million grant from the settlement toward fostering CLTs, and this year, Attorney General Letitia James secured an $8 million bank settlement that will also go toward CLTs . Organizers hope the latest round of funding will give the city’s CLTs the shot in the arm needed to gain ground in the five boroughs. “We hope it signals the tide change,” said Del Rio. “We have these institutions forming—let’s make sure they can acquire property and have a real presence in their neighborhoods.” Next Up In NYC Affordable Housing Budget Cuts Might Doom de Blasio’s Affordable Housing Legacy New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board vote, explained What NYC could do with its $6 billion police budget NYC asks affordable housing developers to house more homeless New Yorkers New York City’s affordable HDFC co-ops, explained New York will offer mortgage relief during coronavirus pandemic.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations Following months of delay, the city Department of Education is prepared to administer the high-stakes Gifted & Talented exam to 4-year-olds -- but the test will no longer be given after this year, fulfilling Mayor Bill de Blasio’s longstanding push to eliminate the test he says reinforces systemwide school segregation. The DOE made the announcement on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, de Blasio said that with parents already preparing their students for the test — which is usually administered in January following a registration period that begins in November — it was only fair to proceed one final time. "At this point in the year, a lot of families had already prepared, they were counting on the opportunity, we respect that. So we'll go forward. But we will not be providing that test in the future," de Blasio said. De Blasio has previously said the demands of the pandemic kept him making a final decision on the test, delaying the process for students to begin selecting G&T programs or schools across the city. A vote to extend the multi-million dollar contract to Pearson Education, which administers the test, will now go before the Panel for Educational Policy—the group that approves contracts, in which 8 of the 13 members are a mayoral appointee—on January 27th. If the panel approves the contract, the test will then be scheduled for April, giving parents time to prepare their children for the logic and math test. Those students who are placed in a G&T program will be able to finish out their G&T schooling throughout their elementary school years, according to the DOE. The decision comes three weeks after de Blasio announced the suspension of screening admissions for middle and high schools , citing the loss of critical screening indicators resulting from the pandemic, such as grades and attendance. A lottery system will now replace the normal admissions process until 2022. Roughly 15,000 young learners who pass the test apply for admissions into a highly coveted G&T program or school across the city each year, with only 2,500 accepted, according to the DOE. Such programs are viewed by some parents as a pipeline to competitive middle and high schools, which critics say reinforces decades-old school segregation in a largely diverse city. The income disparities reflect the demographics of G&T, where a total of 14% of Black and Hispanic students are in the program versus whites, who comprise 36% of the G&T student body. Listen to WNYC's Jessica Gould interview on the impending overhaul of the Gifted & Talented test: Competition is so fierce that G&T test prep has become big business, perpetuating what critics call an unfair system skewed against lower-income New Yorkers unable to afford paying for test prep. With white parents disproportionately earning more than Black and Hispanic parents in New York City, the Parents for Responsive Equitable Safe Schools [PRESS NYC], a group that’s sought to abolish the exam, has long called the G&T racist and classist. In a statement, PRESS NYC criticized the mayor for bowing to demands to keep the test this year. “To knowingly continue this unjust policy this year is the equivalent of allowing ‘just one more voter-suppressed election,’ or ‘just one more season where girls' sports receive less funding’ or ‘just one more year when a student with disabilities is denied access to legally mandated services,’" the group said in a statement. Lucas Liu, co-founder of Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Education, an advocacy group pushing for the expansion of G&T, argues that eliminating the test would be inherently racist, particularly for parents of Black and Hispanic students who seek to expose their children to more rigorous instruction. “Their strategy for closing the achievement gap is to attack achievement and lower the average in order to close the gap instead of helping students that struggling students starting in elementary school, and help raise them,” Liu said. "So we continue to send kids unprepared out into the real world. And I think that's a crime. And actually, I think that's racist because look who the majority of those students are: low-income, Black and Hispanic kids, which the Chancellor continues to do nothing about [in] addressing the education they receive." Liu added that canceling the test will simply place academically ambitious students to subpar schools that won’t meet their need for competitive learning. For now, the DOE plans to hold public sessions this year that will explore alternatives to the G&T programs meant to be “more inclusive, enriching, and truly supports the needs of academically advanced and diversely talented students at a more appropriate age.” While de Blasio has control of the PEP given the overwhelming number of mayoral appointees, Dr. Shannon R. Waite, an appointee for nearly three years, plans to vote against the contract, preferring to end the G&T program this year. Waite cites the country’s long history with racist policies toward Black and Hispanic neighborhoods of color, which have perpetuated school segregation, as one reason she plans to vote down the contract. “Anybody who alleges that they are an advocate of equity, they are an advocate of all students, and they want to see equity for all in racial equity and they believe in education for all will vote no on this contract,” Dr. Waite said. “Otherwise, they are acknowledging and they are complicit. Whether they acknowledge or not, they are complicit in supporting and sustaining white supremacy and racism.” Tagged gifted and talented gifted and talented  David is a former WNYC and Gothamist editor.

Roughly two-thirds of them eventually obtain a high school equivalency credential like the General Educational Development (GED) certificate, with the hope of then obtaining a job. But in today’s changing economy, possessing a GED certificate ― while helpful for finding employment ― often isn’t enough, and many GED recipients will continue to struggle in the labor market. Postsecondary education is also helpful to improve their employment prospects, but fewer than 5 percent of GED recipients go on to enroll in college or other adult education programs. Emphasizing results from quasi-experimental and experimental research, this literature review identifies the most promising approaches for increasing dropouts’ rate of attaining a GED certificate or other high school credential and making a successful transition to college. The report divides these recent interventions into three primary types of adult education reforms: (1) efforts to increase the rigor of adult education instruction and the standards for achieving a credential; (2) GED-to-college “bridge” programs, which integrate academic preparation with increased supports for students’ transition to college; and (3) interventions that allow students to enroll in college while studying to earn a high school credential. Though rigorous research on these reforms is limited, two available studies suggest that programs that contextualize basic skills and GED instruction within specific career fields and that support students in their transition to college show promise in increasing the rate of students’ persistence, earning a high school credential, and entering and succeeding in college. In comparison with traditional adult education programs, these models tend to (1) provide more coherent and relevant instruction through curricula that better align with students’ career goals; (2) provide increased connections with colleges and vocational training programs; and (3) build in an advising component that fosters students’ engagement in the program and supports their transition to college. While these innovations represent promising strides for the field, adult education is still in critical need of reform across a number of areas if the field is to see larger-scale improvements in dropouts’ academic success. First, programs will need to consider how to advance students with lower skills, as few college-readiness adult education programs are available to those with skills below the ninth-grade level. Promising programs, such as LaGuardia Community College’s GED Bridge program in New York City and the state of Washington’s I-BEST program, which enroll lower-skilled students, may serve as models. Alternately, programs might consider building “prebridge” models that help prepare students for these more advanced programs. Second, the fragmented funding streams and agencies upon which adult education programs rely should be streamlined, allowing for a more coherent focus on college- and career-readiness skills. Promising models have been suggested in the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act and revisions to the Perkins Act. In addition, statewide reform efforts in states such as Indiana and Washington could serve as models for achieving interagency integration and coordination.

Govt backed entitlement programs built our middle class and helped families grow their wealth. Unfortunately, these opportunities were handed out to a select few at the expense of others. Historically, the lines have been drawn based on race. It will take 228 years for the average Black family to catch up to the wealth of an average White family today, and that’s only if conditions improve immediately. The current trajectory has Black families averaging $0 in wealth by 2053. Institutional racism was an economic decision, and one that continues to harm all of us, regardless of ethnicity. This workshop will show you how your personal finances are affected and what action you can take to create generational wealth for you and your community. Takeaways the historical policies and events that led up to the current racial wealth inequality how commonly accepted wealth building tools like higher education, homeownership, and entrepreneurship are affected by the racial wealth divide how to break away from the personal responsibility/“bootstraps” narrative that keeps POC from questioning systemic economic oppressions how to unpack your own financial and family history in the context of the racial wealth divide how to approach your finances to create stability, freedom, and generational wealth using the existing systems to your advantage Prereqs & Preparation None Coming up near you Product Management Fundamentals | Two-day Evening Workshop 5 Monday, 5 May 5 Product Management Fundamentals | Two-day Evening Workshop 20 Tuesday, 20 May 20 AI for Career Transition | 3 Hour Workshop 29 Thursday, 29 May 29 AI for Marketers | 7 Hour Workshop 4 Wednesday, 4 June 4 Let’s Keep You Updated Enter your email to start following Thanks You’re following Celebrating Black in Tech: Personal Finances & The Racial Wealth Divide.

In The Color of Law (published by Liveright in May 2017), Richard Rothstein argues with exacting precision and fascinating insight how segregation in America—the incessant kind that continues to dog our major cities and has contributed to so much recent social strife—is the byproduct of explicit government policies at the local, state, and federal levels. Rothstein was a panelist on an EPI webinar, July 9, 2020, discussing his book and Reconstruction 2020: Valuing Black Lives and Economic Opportunities for All. Click here to see watch the webinar. The Color of Law was designated one of ten finalists on the National Book Awards’ long list for the best nonfiction book of 2017. Highlighted media Richard Rothstein discusses The Color of Law on Fresh Air Richard Rothstein in conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates To scholars and social critics, the racial segregation of our neighborhoods has long been viewed as a manifestation of unscrupulous real estate agents, unethical mortgage lenders, and exclusionary covenants working outside the law. This is what is commonly known as “ de facto segregation,” practices that were the outcome of private activity, not law or explicit public policy. Yet, as Rothstein breaks down in case after case, private activity could not have imposed segregation without explicit government policies ( de jure segregation) designed to ensure the separation of African Americans from whites. A former columnist for the New York Times and a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, as well as a Fellow at the Thurgood Marshall Institute of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Rothstein has spent years documenting the evidence that government not merely ignored discriminatory practices in the residential sphere, but promoted them. The impact has been devastating for generations of African-Americans who were denied the right to live where they wanted to live, and raise and school their children where they could flourish most successfully. While the Fair Housing Act of 1968 provided modest enforcement to prevent future discrimination, it did nothing to reverse or undo a century’s worth of state-sanctioned violations of the Bill of Rights, particularly the Thirteenth Amendment which banned treating former slaves as second-class citizens. So the structural conditions established by 20th century federal policy endure to this day. At every step of the way, Rothstein demonstrates, the government and our courts upheld racist policies to maintain the separation of whites and blacks—leading to the powder keg that has defined Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, and Chicago. The Color of Law is not a tale of Red versus Blue states. It is sadly the story of America in all of its municipalities, large and small, liberal and reactionary. As William Julius Wilson has stated: “ The Color of Law is one of those rare books that will be discussed and debated for many decades.” What readers of The Color of Law have written: “Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law is one of those rare books that will be discussed and debated for many decades. Based on careful analyses of multiple historical documents, Rothstein has presented what I consider to be the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation.” (William Julius Wilson, author of The Truly Disadvantaged ) “Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law offers an original and insightful explanation of how government policy in the United States intentionally promoted and enforced residential racial segregation. The central premise of his argument, which calls for a fundamental reexamination of American constitutional law, is that the Supreme Court has failed for decades to understand the extent to which residential racial segregation in our nation is not the result of private decisions by private individuals, but is the direct product of unconstitutional government action. The implications of his analysis are revolutionary.” (Geoffrey R. Stone, author of Sex and the Constitution ) “A masterful explication of the single most vexing problem facing black America: the concentration of the poor and middle class into segregated neighborhoods. Rothstein documents the deep historical roots and the continuing practices in law and social custom that maintain a profoundly un-American system holding down the nation’s most disadvantaged citizens.” (Thomas B. Edsall, author of The Age of Austerity ) “Through meticulous research and powerful human stories, Richard Rothstein reveals a history of racism hiding in plain sight and compels us to confront the consequences of the intentional, decades-long governmental policies that created a segregated America. The American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book.” (Sherrilyn A. Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund) “Racial segregation does not just happen; it is made. Written with a spatial imagination, this exacting and exigent book traces how public policies across a wide spectrum―including discriminatory zoning, taxation, subsidies, and explicit redlining―have shaped the racial fracturing of America. At once analytical and passionate, The Color of Law discloses why segregation has persisted, even deepened, in the post–civil rights era, and thoughtfully proposes how remedies might be pursued. A must-read.” (Ira Katznelson, author of the Bancroft Prize–winning Fear Itself) “This wonderful, important book could not be more timely. It shows how federal, state, and local government housing policies made the United States two societies, separate and unequal, and used public power to impose unfair, profoundly damaging injuries on African Americans. The book is filled with history that’s been deliberately buried even as its tragic consequences make headlines in Ferguson, Tulsa, Dallas, Staten Island, Charleston―and throughout the country. With its clarity and breadth, the book is literally a page-turner: once one begins on this journey with Richard Rothstein, one is not likely to stop before the conclusion, with a determination that the injustices described must be redressed fully and immediately.” (Florence Roisman, William F.

You can also purchase the book at Amazon.com , Barnes & Noble , IndieBound.org , or your local bookseller.  Barnes & Noble  IndieBound.org In The Color of Law (published by Liveright in May 2017), Richard Rothstein argues with exacting precision and fascinating insight how segregation in America—the incessant kind that continues to dog our major cities and has contributed to so much recent social strife—is the byproduct of explicit government policies at the local, state, and federal levels. Rothstein was a panelist on an EPI webinar, July 9, 2020, discussing his book and Reconstruction 2020: Valuing Black Lives and Economic Opportunities for All. Click here to see watch the webinar. The Color of Law was designated one of ten finalists on the National Book Awards’ long list for the best nonfiction book of 2017. Highlighted media Richard Rothstein discusses The Color of Law on Fresh Air Richard Rothstein in conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates To scholars and social critics, the racial segregation of our neighborhoods has long been viewed as a manifestation of unscrupulous real estate agents, unethical mortgage lenders, and exclusionary covenants working outside the law. This is what is commonly known as “ de facto segregation,” practices that were the outcome of private activity, not law or explicit public policy. Yet, as Rothstein breaks down in case after case, private activity could not have imposed segregation without explicit government policies ( de jure segregation) designed to ensure the separation of African Americans from whites. A former columnist for the New York Times and a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, as well as a Fellow at the Thurgood Marshall Institute of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Rothstein has spent years documenting the evidence that government not merely ignored discriminatory practices in the residential sphere, but promoted them. The impact has been devastating for generations of African-Americans who were denied the right to live where they wanted to live, and raise and school their children where they could flourish most successfully. While the Fair Housing Act of 1968 provided modest enforcement to prevent future discrimination, it did nothing to reverse or undo a century’s worth of state-sanctioned violations of the Bill of Rights, particularly the Thirteenth Amendment which banned treating former slaves as second-class citizens. So the structural conditions established by 20th century federal policy endure to this day. At every step of the way, Rothstein demonstrates, the government and our courts upheld racist policies to maintain the separation of whites and blacks—leading to the powder keg that has defined Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, and Chicago. The Color of Law is not a tale of Red versus Blue states. It is sadly the story of America in all of its municipalities, large and small, liberal and reactionary. As William Julius Wilson has stated: “ The Color of Law is one of those rare books that will be discussed and debated for many decades.” What readers of The Color of Law have written: “Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law is one of those rare books that will be discussed and debated for many decades. Based on careful analyses of multiple historical documents, Rothstein has presented what I consider to be the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation.” (William Julius Wilson, author of The Truly Disadvantaged ) “Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law offers an original and insightful explanation of how government policy in the United States intentionally promoted and enforced residential racial segregation. The central premise of his argument, which calls for a fundamental reexamination of American constitutional law, is that the Supreme Court has failed for decades to understand the extent to which residential racial segregation in our nation is not the result of private decisions by private individuals, but is the direct product of unconstitutional government action. The implications of his analysis are revolutionary.” (Geoffrey R. Stone, author of Sex and the Constitution ) “A masterful explication of the single most vexing problem facing black America: the concentration of the poor and middle class into segregated neighborhoods. Rothstein documents the deep historical roots and the continuing practices in law and social custom that maintain a profoundly un-American system holding down the nation’s most disadvantaged citizens.” (Thomas B. Edsall, author of The Age of Austerity ) “Through meticulous research and powerful human stories, Richard Rothstein reveals a history of racism hiding in plain sight and compels us to confront the consequences of the intentional, decades-long governmental policies that created a segregated America. The American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book.” (Sherrilyn A. Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund) “Racial segregation does not just happen; it is made. Written with a spatial imagination, this exacting and exigent book traces how public policies across a wide spectrum―including discriminatory zoning, taxation, subsidies, and explicit redlining―have shaped the racial fracturing of America. At once analytical and passionate, The Color of Law discloses why segregation has persisted, even deepened, in the post–civil rights era, and thoughtfully proposes how remedies might be pursued. A must-read.” (Ira Katznelson, author of the Bancroft Prize–winning Fear Itself) “This wonderful, important book could not be more timely. It shows how federal, state, and local government housing policies made the United States two societies, separate and unequal, and used public power to impose unfair, profoundly damaging injuries on African Americans. The book is filled with history that’s been deliberately buried even as its tragic consequences make headlines in Ferguson, Tulsa, Dallas, Staten Island, Charleston―and throughout the country.

Since 2020, MAS has teamed with Regional Plan Association and NYU’s Guarini Center on Environmental, Energy, and Land Use Law as part of the CEQR Reform Coalition to examine ways to advance CEQR evaluation methodology, mitigate impacts of development, and increase transparency.  This page presents an overview of our CEQR reform work. Related content: SITE x SITE (2023) SITE x SITE (2023) SITE x SITE is an unprecedented citywide study by the Municipal Art Society and Regional Plan Association of how soft sites have been developed over time. Soft sites are sites identified and evaluated in  CEQR  where development is likely to happen following the approval of a neighborhood rezoning or large-scale development. A reliable soft site analysis is critical to a comprehensive analysis of the full effect a rezoning may have on a neighborhood, particularly when it comes to public schools, transit, traffic, open space, socioeconomics, and other important factors. When soft site identification is incomplete or faulty, communities are often left with unintended consequences such as over-utilized schools, crowded subway stations, displaced residents and businesses, and a lack of public open space. Please explore SITE x SITE’s user-friendly mapping tool that shows how soft sites have been developed throughout the city and how they relate to   key regulatory and land use factors such as historic districts, the coastal zone, and recently rezoned areas SITE x SITE also includes a detailed  report that covers methodology, important findings, case studies, and recommendations for improving CEQR evaluations. Here’s a two-page project brief summarizing the findings in the report. As part of the SITE x SITE initiative and the CEQR Coalition’s work, NYU’s legal article Impact Fees in New York City? Legal Authority, Constraints, and Potential Options examines the legality of imposing impact fees to address development in New York City. Read Report Up to the TASC (2021) Up to the TASC (2021) Technical Advancement and Support of Comprehensive Planning and CEQR Reform (TASC), launched in 2019, was the first project undertaken by the CEQR Reform Coalition. As outlined in the project’s companion report Up to the TASC: Incorporating Data into CEQR and Comprehensive Planning , the Coalition sought to improve CEQR by identifying an expanded list of factors that affect development. The Coalition created an index of 45 built environment and social vulnerability factors. The factors were incorporated into a framework for a future comprehensive mapping tool that would allow users to formulate future development scenarios at the neighborhood level. TASC also supports our ongoing advocacy on comprehensive planning and strengthening community-led planning. TASC also includes NYU’s report Reforming CEQR: Improving Mitigation Under the City Environmental Quality Review Process , which draws upon existing literature and case studies of several CEQR evaluations and lays out broad goals for reforming the City’s approach to mitigating impacts of development following major rezonings. Read Report A Tale of Two Rezonings (2018) A Tale of Two Rezonings (2018) In A Tale of Two Rezonings: Taking a Harder Look at CEQR , MAS conducted a retrospective analysis of the CEQR development projections and impact evaluations of the rezonings of Long Island City (2001) and Downtown Brooklyn (2004) to see how they measured up to the actual development that occurred in these neighborhoods. The CEQR evaluation for Long Island City’s rezoning projected a mere 300 new dwelling units would be built. However, as of 2018, the rezoning produced almost nine million square feet of new residential development, adding more than 10,000 new units to the area. The CEQR evaluation for Downtown Brooklyn’s rezoning predicted the construction of 979 new residential units by 2013, when in fact, more than 3,000 new units had been constructed, with an additional 5,000 built since. The City’s miscalculations were not trivial. The larger issue is the failure of the City to anticipate and plan for the real world results of zoning changes in these two neighborhoods. The mitigation measures that were proposed in the FEIS addressed adverse impacts from a development scenario that never happened, and the environmental impacts that did occur were largely never evaluated.

Español 中文 The D15 Diversity Plan process has been established to create a community-based middle school diversity plan for School District 15 in Brooklyn, New York. Download the 2018 Final Plan here. Download the 2024 Evaluation here. The New York City Department of Education (DOE) is committed to supporting schools and programs that reflect New York City’s diversity. On June 6, 2017, we shared Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools . As part of this citywide school diversity plan, we are providing more formal support to community school districts in the development of district-level diversity plans. Our goal is to create a D15 Diversity Plan that will promote diversity in District 15’s middle schools and also be a model for district-level work across New York City. To best meet this goal, we are engaging community members, using their input to help shape the plan, and making data related to school diversity more transparent. What’s Happening Now? Interested in hearing more about the District 15 Diversity Plan? Fill out this form and we’ll call you. The Department of Education worked with the urban planning and design firm WXY Studio and the D15 community to develop the D15 Diversity Plan over the 2017-2018 school year. Brooklyn’s School District 15 (Boerum Hill, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Fort Greene, Gowanus, Kensington, Park Slope, Sunset Park, Red Hook, and Windsor Terrace) is a choice school district for middle schools—there are no zoned middle schools in the district, which means that its 11 middle schools do not serve a specific geographic area within District 15. Ten of these middle schools use a screened admissions method, which means they consider students’ grades, test scores, attendance, and/or other factors when making matches. Starting in August 2017, DOE and WXY worked with community leaders and stakeholders to convene a project Working Group – responsible for ensuring an inclusive community process and for incorporating community feedback into a framework and set of recommendations. Since January 2018, three large Public Workshops and one final Community Presentation was held, reaching more than 500 D15 community members. Public Workshop #1 introduced the planning process and provided participants the opportunity to discuss the current middle school admissions process, segregation in D15 and the challenges related to integration. Public Workshop #2 touched briefly on the historical roles of racism and segregation, examined how the D15 population has changed over time, and provided community members with an opportunity to share their ideas on how to integrate schools and to create inclusive school environments. At Public Workshop #3, community members provided feedback on a set of initial draft recommendations. Feedback from this workshop was used to further refine the ideas presented. A final set of draft recommendations was presented at a Community Presentation in June. What Comes Next? The D15 Diversity Plan Working Group released its final plan on August 3, 2018 and is currently being reviewed by the department. The DOE’s current timeline for responding to the Working Group and the District 15 community is the end of the summer. As the DOE reviews and responds to these recommendations, the DOE will make sure its response is thorough and answers the outstanding questions that it has heard from the community about how to make sure that any approved recommendations are implemented in a thoughtful way. The DOE will make sure that any changes are explained to the community in an easy to understand way, and will continue to engage the community to discuss what any changes will look like as we head into the next school year.

(Michael Appleton/Mayoral photography office) The coronavirus pandemic will force major changes in the ways students are admitted to New York City’s competitive middle and high schools this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Chancellor Richard Carranza announced Friday. Middle schools will not use test scores or other academic “screens” to select students, auditions for performing arts schools are going virtual, and the controversial Specialized High School Admissions Test will be administered in middle schools across the city, rather than at just a handful of campuses. The city will also eliminate a district-based admissions preference that has allowed some of the city’s wealthiest ZIP codes to carve out a set of its own elite high schools . New York City is home to one of the most segregated school systems in the country, a status driven partly by its admissions practices. For years, integration advocates have been pushing the city to revamp the competitive and stressful process for the city’s 10- and 13-year-olds, which often favors more affluent families that have the time and savvy to navigate it. De Blasio has proved reluctant to pursue citywide reform until, late into his final term, the pandemic forced his hand. An overhaul became inevitable in the wake of the health crisis as the main data points used to screen — last year’s fourth and seventh grade state tests, grades, and attendance — were put on pause or dramatically changed. On Friday, the mayor provided some of his most forceful comments yet about the need to pursue integration measures. “If we say the price of a quality education is segregation, well that’s ridiculous. If we say we want everyone in the same classroom together, but we don’t care about educational quality, well that’s ridiculous, too,” he said. “I think we’ve all been sold a false premise. We can actually do both — we can have quality schools and schools where we all learn together.” Some of the changes take aim at polices that have been seen as instrumental to getting more affluent and white parents to enroll in the public school system. The mayor acknowledged the new plan could be difficult for some parents to accept, but said that he hoped it could eventually build buy-in for more changes. “We want to work with school communities. We want to listen to educators and parents. But what is clear is that our past involves too much exclusion. Our past includes too much inequality,” he said. “We need to move to a different place.” In addition to the new admissions policies, the city is opening applications for grants for five more districts to pursue integration plans on their own — bringing the total to 10 districts. Become a Chalkbeat sponsor Some of the changes now going into effect could set the city on a path towards more diverse schools. But there are good reasons to be skeptical since the city is not implementing any reforms that explicitly favor integration, and admissions systems based purely on choice have consistently failed to produce more representative schools. One of the most explosive admissions debates remains unresolved. A decision has still not been made about applying to the city’s gifted & talented programs for elementary schools. Entry to these coveted programs hinges on a standardized test given to preschoolers, administered one-on-one by a proctor. It could prove difficult to administer safely in the midst of rising coronavirus cases across the city. Moving the process online would raise equity issues, since thousands of students lack access to devices or reliable internet. Currently, enrollment in gifted and talented programs is disproportionately Asian and white. Now that schools and families know how the process will work, the city must communicate the changes widely and clearly, said Karuna Patel, deputy director of the Feerick Center, which has advised the education department on ways to make the admissions system more fair. Otherwise, families who have traditionally struggled to make sense of the process could be at a disadvantage. “You can imagine the flow of information, if it’s not coming through DOE well, it’s really going to exacerbate the problems we’re talking about. Who does best in a system where information is king?” she said. “They really need to be thoughtful about how to implement this.” Sweeping changes for middle schools The most sweeping changes will affect middle schools. All middle schools will pause their use of academic screens for one year, the education department said. That includes auditions for performing arts programs and school-based assessments. Around 40% of middle schools currently accept students based on their academic records. Schools that don’t have enough seats for all applicants will base admissions on a lottery. There is precedent for such a move: Brooklyn’s District 15 recently eliminated screening at its middle schools in favor of a lottery. The aim was to create more diverse schools, and early data show progress towards that goal . But Brooklyn’s plan includes something that the city’s does not: a priority geared towards admitting students who represent the district’s racial and economic diversity. It’s possible that a lottery for middle schools does not change school demographics significantly, especially in districts that are not diverse themselves. Without an explicit focus on admitting a diverse group of students, admissions systems based purely on choice often fall short of integration goals. District 1 on the Lower East Side had such a system, and its schools were deeply segregated. Parents recently lobbied to add admissions priorities to the lottery to encourage more diversity. Become a Chalkbeat sponsor “Experience tells us that choice alone is not enough to guarantee there will be diverse and integrated schools in any given district. We’ve found there need to be some guardrails,” said Stefan Lallinger, a fellow at The Century Foundation think tank, where he leads a nationwide initiative to encourage school integration. The education department said that district priorities will remain in place, which give students an admissions preference based on where they live, in order to allow younger students to attend schools closer to home. Schools like those in District 15, which give other preferences that aren’t based on academic records, will be allowed to keep those intact. The elimination of middle school screens will only be for one year. With Mayor Bill de Blasio term-limited, that could turn school integration and admissions policy into an issue on the campaign trail to replace him. At both the middle- and high school-level, selective admissions practices have been credited with drawing white and more affluent families into the public school system, and many parents who have managed to navigate the system well have fought to preserve it. Threats of white flight are often leveled against integration proposals, but research suggests that more diverse schools are beneficial for students of all races and backgrounds, Lallinger said. De Blasio echoed that point on Friday. “You give everyone a chance to learn together, they benefit from it. They gain from it. It’s an education unto itself for people to learn together and get to know each other,” he said. “I understand the emotions of parents who believe there was one particular way to do things and then to see that changing, that for them that can be difficult.” Middle school applications will open the week of Jan. 11, and close the week of Feb. 8th. High schools to continue screening High schools will still be allowed to screen students, relying on academic records from before the health crisis struck. The most notable change is the immediate elimination of district admissions priorities. New York City’s high school application process was designed to open access to students regardless of their ZIP codes. But some schools across the city give priority to those students living within their own district. Nowhere is it more controversial — and fiercely guarded — than Manhattan’s District 2. Spanning TriBeCa to the Upper East Side, the district is one of the whitest and most affluent, and students who live there have been given admissions preference at a handful of coveted high schools. Those schools are especially segregated, with almost quadruple the enrollment of white students compared to the citywide average. Recently, principals at four schools that offer District 2 priority called on the city to eliminate it , in the hopes of enrolling a more diverse student body. For next year’s admission cycle, the city plans to do away with any other geographic priorities, including admissions preferences given to students within the school’s borough. Become a Chalkbeat sponsor The changes may not amount to much when it comes to school integration since schools can still screen students. New York City has a higher share of “screened” schools than anywhere else in the country, meaning many of the most sought-after programs admit students based on their academic records. Getting accepted to these schools is often a competitive and complicated process, and screened programs tend to enroll fewer Black, Latino, and low-income students. The city is taking steps to make the process more transparent and streamlined: High schools will be required to post their long-shrouded admissions rubrics publicly, and the education department, instead of schools themselves, will be responsible for ranking where applicants fall on acceptance lists. High school applications will open the week of Jan. 18. The deadline will be the week of Feb. 22. The SHSAT will go on Students will take the entrance exam for specialized high schools —  widely regarded as the Ivy League of public high schools — at their own middle schools. Registration for the exam begins on Dec. 21 and closes on Jan. 15. The test will be administered starting the week of Jan. 27. Eighth graders who opted to attend school in person this year will take the test alongside their “cohorts,” the group of children in their classes, to account for social distancing and limit possible exposure to the coronavirus and cut down on the need to travel to take the test. Most New York City students, however, have chosen to learn exclusively from home. Those students will have to test in-person at their schools, the education department said. Make-up dates will be scheduled for students who may be quarantined on their test day. One of the city’s most heated admissions debates has long centered on the specialized high schools like Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, which admit students based solely on the results of a single test. De Blasio launched a campaign to eliminate the test, which is required by state law. He faced a wave of protest and a lawsuit . Pushback has been particularly fierce among Asian parents, whose children make up a majority of enrollment in the specialized schools. But many blame the exam for excluding other students of color. The schools enroll only about 10% Black and Hispanic students, who together make up almost 70% of enrollment citywide. Integration advocates have lobbied the legislature to do away with the exam, and argued that the ongoing pandemic makes it unsafe to administer in person. The city could likely do away with the exam at five of the eight schools that require it (a ninth specialized high school for performing arts requires auditions), though mayor de Blasio has disputed that. Auditions pivot to online Students trying out for performing and visual arts programs — including the famed LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan and Queens’ Frank Sinatra School of the Arts — will submit their applications virtually. Students will record themselves singing, dancing, or performing monologues, or take pictures of their work. Some schools posted about the new online process on their websites , but the education department said at the time that the information shared prematurely and hadn’t been finalized.

The plan’s goals would be to prioritize the safety of all street users, the use of mass transit, the reduction of vehicle emissions, and access for individuals with disabilities. Each plan would include certain benchmarks. The first plan would be due in December of 2021 and would include:
• 150 miles of physically or camera-protected bus lanes over five years, with at least 20 miles in the first year and at least 30 miles during each subsequent year;
• Transit signal priority at 750 intersections during the first year and 1,000 intersections during each subsequent year;
• 250 miles of protected bike lanes over five years, with at least 30 miles in the first year and 50 miles in each subsequent year;
• Bus stop upgrades like benches, shelters, and real-time passenger information at 500 bus stops each year;
• Redesigning at least 2,000 signalized intersections over five years, with at least 400 redesigns each year;
• Accessible pedestrian signals at no fewer than 2,500 intersections, with at least 500 installations each year;
• Assessing and amending commercial loading zones and truck routes;
• Developing parking policies to promote the master plan’s goals of safety, mass transit use, reduced vehicle emissions, and access for individuals with disabilities; and
• Within the first two years, create and maintain one million square feet of pedestrian space.
  The following master plan, due in 2026, would include the completion of a connected bike lane network, installation of physically or camera-protected bus lanes on all routes where they can be installed, installation of accessible pedestrian signals at no fewer than 2,500 intersections over five years, installation of bus stop upgrades at all bus stops, redesign at least 2,000 intersections over five years, and installation of pedestrian ramps at no fewer than 3,000 street corners.

The School Diversity Advisory Group was charged with coming up with ways to desegregate one of the most segregated school systems in the country. As part of its nearly 70 recommendations, the group proposed eliminating the city’s current, highly segregated method of delivering G&T education. But the recommendation was not a call to stop nurturing or cultivating students’ academic strengths, as some have suggested. Instead, it offers an opportunity to look at how coveted educational programs became so segregated and whether there is a better way to deliver enriched curriculum. Prior to the 2007-2008 school year, community school districts were able to utilize a holistic system for evaluating admissions to neighborhood G&T programs. Generally, admission required a privately-administered IQ test, and could also include teacher recommendations and classroom observations. That year, Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein eliminated the holistic admissions model, replacing it with a single standardized test and a single cutoff score, under the auspices of making the system more objective. In order to gain admission into a district G&T program, children as young as four now had to achieve a score in the nationwide 90th-percentile on the exam. Essentially overnight, there was a catastrophic drop in the number of Black and Latinx children admitted to these programs, from 31 percent Black students in 2007 to 13 percent Black students in 2008. The children who did best on the tests often had access to expensive prep courses and private preschools. We need to move away from a system where children are labeled and sorted into cohorts, and toward one where each student’s individual needs are met New York’s extremely racially-segregated housing patterns multiplied the effects of this change to admissions. In districts where too few children scored high enough, G&T programs were eliminated, so even if children did qualify they would have to travel across neighborhoods or even boroughs in order to enroll. This domino effect meant that some districts in the Bronx and Central Brooklyn, for example, had no G&T programs, reducing parents’ familiarity with them and knowledge of how to apply, even if they would be willing to send their kids to a school across town. And parents’ understandable unwillingness to send their young kids to faraway schools meant that surviving G&T programs became less and less diverse. Fast forward to today, when more than 75 percent of students in G&T programs are white or Asian, and it’s obvious the status quo is unacceptable. Some elected officials have pointed to the shuttering of G&T programs in communities of color and suggested the city should add more programs instead of rethinking G&T altogether. But there is compelling data that any increase in G&T just increases racial isolation. The history, and some would say the purpose, of G&T education in New York City is to segregate students by race and affluence. As long as we maintain the programs, the programs will be segregated. This is not to say we should reduce any student’s access to rigorous, challenging, or enriched curriculum. In fact, there is no G&T curriculum; most students receive merely an accelerated version of the same lessons used in the majority of New York City schools. That curriculum has been criticized for being too narrow, Euro-centric, and test-obsessed. So why not enhance it for everyone? Every kid is more engaged when they see themselves and their culture reflected in school, when they are allowed to be creative, when the work challenges them, and when they are well-supported to meet the challenge. We need to move away from a system where children are labeled and sorted into cohorts, and toward one where each student’s individual needs are met, speed of learning is respected, and talents are cultivated. New York City kids deserve an education system that makes room for enrichment in any area where they excel, without discounting that they may struggle in other subjects, or even have a disability that requires more support. They deserve to learn with and from all their classmates. We don’t have to look far for examples. In 2017, District Eight in the Bronx began offering enriched curriculum to all students, not just those who qualify for a designated G&T program, and demonstrated benefits across their student body. The education professor who designed the curriculum used in D8 said the main tenets were engagement, enthusiasm, and enjoyment. The curriculum helped students learn by getting them excited to be in school. The City should work with the Department of Education to explore ways to provide enriched and advanced curriculum to all students, rather than continuing to label and segregate kids.

The MAP approach enlists residents, City agencies and community-based partners to help move beyond enforcement and address the factors underlying safety – providing opportunities for work and play, health and well-being, and youth development; promoting activated, well-maintained spaces through community and human-centered design; and improving trust between neighbors with a responsive and just government. MAP’s mission is to improve community safety in places impacted by historic disinvestment by creating opportunities for residents to identify key issues underlying crime and participate in the decision-making to address these priorities. Through NeighborhoodStat , the operational centerpiece of MAP, we harness the collective expertise of residents, government and community partners to drive meaningful dialogue, problem solving and, ultimately, change at both the neighborhood and administrative levels. We do this by: Amplifying and empowering resident voice and creating access to government decisions, policymaking and resources for residents; Investing in residents’ capacity to influence government systems to achieve their own aims; Coordinating government services to increase access to existing resources and to respond directly and proactively to residents’ community safety priorities; and Supporting residents through an engaged design process where they are leaders in the planning, implementation, and stewardship of the spaces in their communities.

After months of mass layoffs, more than half of Black adults are unemployed. And as new coronavirus cases spike across the country, 19 states are reversing or pausing their re-opening plans, which will trigger new waves of lost jobs. This recession, caused by a pandemic that’s killing Black people at more than twice the rate that it’s killing White people, won’t end without bold government action — and if we do nothing, Black workers will be hurt the most. A paycheck guarantee could change that. Representative Pramila Jayapal recently introduced the Paycheck Recovery Act , a new proposal for a simple new federal program that would directly cover up 100 percent of workers’ paychecks throughout the coronavirus crisis. The proposal would cover up to $90,000 per worker, and cover every single person working at a business facing a significant revenue loss. Senators Mark Warner, Bernie Sanders, Doug Jones, and Richard Blumenthal introduced similar legislation in the Senate . Both bills would also apply retrospectively to people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic — who could be added back to their former employers’ payrolls, even while the government covers workers’ paychecks while they must stay safe and socially distanced at home. Paycheck guarantees are working abroad, and they can work here too. Germany, Denmark, and Canada have all put similar programs in place, and stopped the mass unemployment that we’re seeing in the United States. The International Monetary Fund predicts that Germany’s unemployment rate will peak at just 3.9% this year . By contrast, the U.S. unemployment rate is already three times higher , and likely to get worse. Black workers always suffer most in a recession and this is no exception. During recessions, corporations treat Black workers as the “ first fired, last hired ” — as the economy recovers, the Black unemployment rate falls more slowly. Years after the Great Recession, Black workers were disproportionately likely to become long-term unemployed , making it harder for them to find jobs and depressing their wages in the future. We’re already seeing the seeds of this pattern: as white unemployment rates started to temporarily decline this month, the Black unemployment rate continued to rise . A paycheck guarantee would Black workers from being displaced, allow millions of workers to return to get their jobs back, and help facilitate a safe recovery. The pandemic’s impacts reflect a long history of structural racism. A paycheck guarantee would also help ensure Black workers have a stable source of income as waves of the virus force states and cities to shut back down. In March, Congress passed critical (but temporary) improvements to unemployment insurance, including by providing workers who lose their job during the pandemic an extra $600 per week in benefits. Expanded unemployment insurance benefits have made it possible for workers to make ends meet during the pandemic — but workers face huge obstacles, from crashing websites, long lines, and language barriers, to accessing these UI benefits. This Spring, less than half of unemployed workers were able to get unemployment insurance payments, and Black workers were even less likely . The Paycheck Recovery Act would remove these barriers, and guarantee workers stable incomes and health care benefits — as opposed to our current reality, in which 27 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance along with their jobs. And by keeping the economy stable, a paycheck guarantee would ease the pressure on states and cities to rush to reopen. As part of a June 2020 survey , Data for Progress, in partnership with the Justice Collaborative Institute, tested voters attitudes about the Paycheck Recovery Act — and found overwhelming support from registered voters. Strong majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans support the proposal, as do strong majorities of Black, Latinx, and white voters. The proposal gathered support from both men and women, voters who’ve attended college and those who didn’t, and voters under 45 and older. The first proposal Data for Progress polled was a proposal for the federal government to step in and directly cover workers’ paychecks during the  coronavirus 19 crisis — just like the government has done in Denmark and Germany . Specifically, DFP asked voters the following question: Do you support or oppose the government stepping in to guarantee workers’ paychecks during the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, saving jobs and putting millions of people back to work? DFP found overwhelming, bipartisan, and multiracial support for this paycheck guarantee proposal. Overall, voters support it by a staggering 59-point margin (75 percent support, 16 percent oppose). Support is broadly consistent regardless of gender, race, or age. Voters 45-years-and-up were slightly more likely to support the proposal (76 percent support) than younger voters (72 percent support). The second proposal Data for Progress polled was a proposal to extend the Paycheck Guarantee to workers who’ve been laid off during the coronavirus pandemic. Both the House Paycheck Recovery Act and the Senate Paycheck Security Act include provisions that would cover wages for workers who were laid off since the start of the pandemic — allowing them to re-connect to their old job and receive a guaranteed paycheck while safely sheltering in place at home. This would allow workers to maintain a steady income if they were called back to work, then required to stay home again as states reverse their re-opening plans. Specifically, DFP asked voters: Do you support or oppose the government stepping in to cover workers' paychecks at businesses with significant coronavirus (COVID-19) related revenue losses, so that businesses can rehire laid-off workers — provided that no one would be required to come into work until it was safe? DFP also found even more support for this proposal. Overall, voters support it by a 60-point margin (75 percent of voters support, 15 percent oppose). Again, support was largely steady across race, age, and education levels. Black voters are slightly more supportive of the proposal (77 percent support) than white voters (75 percent support). The proposal has the strongest support from Democrats (79 percent support), but still garners overwhelming majorities from Independents (73 percent support) and Republicans (69 percent support). A previous Data for Progress poll on an early version of this proposal also found strong support across rural, suburban, and urban areas. All across our nation, voters want the Paycheck Recovery Act to guarantee workers a steady paycheck while we endure this coronavirus crisis.

A paycheck guarantee would Black workers from being displaced, allow millions of workers to return to get their jobs back, and help facilitate a safe recovery. The pandemic’s impacts reflect a long history of structural racism. A paycheck guarantee would also help ensure Black workers have a stable source of income as waves of the virus force states and cities to shut back down. In March, Congress passed critical (but temporary) improvements to unemployment insurance, including by providing workers who lose their job during the pandemic an extra $600 per week in benefits. Expanded unemployment insurance benefits have made it possible for workers to make ends meet during the pandemic — but workers face huge obstacles, from crashing websites, long lines, and language barriers, to accessing these UI benefits. This Spring, less than half of unemployed workers were able to get unemployment insurance payments, and Black workers were even less likely . The Paycheck Recovery Act would remove these barriers, and guarantee workers stable incomes and health care benefits — as opposed to our current reality, in which 27 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance along with their jobs. And by keeping the economy stable, a paycheck guarantee would ease the pressure on states and cities to rush to reopen. As part of a June 2020 survey , Data for Progress, in partnership with the Justice Collaborative Institute, tested voters attitudes about the Paycheck Recovery Act — and found overwhelming support from registered voters. Strong majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans support the proposal, as do strong majorities of Black, Latinx, and white voters. The proposal gathered support from both men and women, voters who’ve attended college and those who didn’t, and voters under 45 and older. The first proposal Data for Progress polled was a proposal for the federal government to step in and directly cover workers’ paychecks during the  coronavirus 19 crisis — just like the government has done in Denmark and Germany . Specifically, DFP asked voters the following question: Do you support or oppose the government stepping in to guarantee workers’ paychecks during the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, saving jobs and putting millions of people back to work? DFP found overwhelming, bipartisan, and multiracial support for this paycheck guarantee proposal. Overall, voters support it by a staggering 59-point margin (75 percent support, 16 percent oppose). Support is broadly consistent regardless of gender, race, or age. Voters 45-years-and-up were slightly more likely to support the proposal (76 percent support) than younger voters (72 percent support). The second proposal Data for Progress polled was a proposal to extend the Paycheck Guarantee to workers who’ve been laid off during the coronavirus pandemic. Both the House Paycheck Recovery Act and the Senate Paycheck Security Act include provisions that would cover wages for workers who were laid off since the start of the pandemic — allowing them to re-connect to their old job and receive a guaranteed paycheck while safely sheltering in place at home. This would allow workers to maintain a steady income if they were called back to work, then required to stay home again as states reverse their re-opening plans. Specifically, DFP asked voters: Do you support or oppose the government stepping in to cover workers' paychecks at businesses with significant coronavirus (COVID-19) related revenue losses, so that businesses can rehire laid-off workers — provided that no one would be required to come into work until it was safe? DFP also found even more support for this proposal. Overall, voters support it by a 60-point margin (75 percent of voters support, 15 percent oppose). Again, support was largely steady across race, age, and education levels. Black voters are slightly more supportive of the proposal (77 percent support) than white voters (75 percent support). The proposal has the strongest support from Democrats (79 percent support), but still garners overwhelming majorities from Independents (73 percent support) and Republicans (69 percent support). A previous Data for Progress poll on an early version of this proposal also found strong support across rural, suburban, and urban areas. All across our nation, voters want the Paycheck Recovery Act to guarantee workers a steady paycheck while we endure this coronavirus crisis.

By Annie Lowrey Constance Bannister / Image Source / Getty / Katie Martin / The Atlantic June 29, 2020 Share Save What if a single, cheap, easy-to-administer, and race-neutral policy could help close the country’s chasmic racial wealth gap in less than a generation? Reader, it exists. It is called a baby-bond program. For something like $80 billion a year—roughly 2 percent of the annual federal budget, less than a tenth of the annual cost of Social Security—the United States could not only end its most pernicious forms of poverty, reduce wealth inequality, improve social mobility, foster self-sufficiency among poor families, and increase family net worth en masse, but also put black and white families on more equal footing. There is a strong moral case for doing that, and a strong economic case, too. The average white family is 10 times wealthier than the average black family. Black families with kids have a single penny in wealth for every dollar that white families with kids have. And white high-school dropouts have a higher net worth, on average, than black college graduates. Black individuals cannot close this gap on their own. Washington created the wealth gap. Washington needs to fix it. Read: American wealth is broken Today’s racial wealth inequality is a product of many decades of government policy, not the differing actions and choices of black and white individuals. The Social Security Act, for instance, initially excluded agricultural and domestic workers, who were disproportionately black. The GI Bill offered college tuition, home loans, and unemployment benefits to white veterans, while excluding black veterans. The Federal Housing Administration instituted redlining and fomented racial housing segregation. “It’s not about savings,” Thomas Shapiro, the director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, told me. “It’s about institutional practices.” Contemporary institutional practices sustain the gap created in past centuries. Consider how the tax code not just perpetuates, but actively generates, racial wealth inequality. A refusal to levy significant taxes on inheritances encourages dynastic wealth, meaning white wealth. ( Ahem .) The country taxes paid labor more heavily than passive income, predominantly accumulated by white families. The home-mortgage interest deduction, the 529 college-savings program : These kinds of regressive elements Swiss-cheese the code. And in myriad other ways , government policies extract money from black families and black communities. Fines-and-fees policing, for instance, functions as a covert tax on black Americans. Even when they earn very high incomes, many black individuals end up accumulating far less wealth than their white peers. That’s in part because black workers tend to offer more financial support to poor relatives , and in part because black kids are more likely to have to take out hefty student loans to pay for college. Those factors add up to less money socked away in a savings account or invested in the stock market, and less money to pass along to children. Even if a multifarious, complicated set of policies helped create the racial wealth gap, another multifarious, complicated set of policies is not necessary to start to close it. A little-known but elegant solution is waiting for implementation, a policy suggested by Thomas Paine in Agrarian Justice and rewritten for the modern era by Darrick Hamilton, who leads the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, and Sandy Darity, the director of the Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University. Baby bonds are simple. The government would create investment accounts for infants, giving babies born to poor families large seed grants and babies born to rich families small ones. The money would grow, and kids would gain access to it when they reached adulthood, to use for school, a down payment, or a start-up. That’s it. Black families need wealth. The government could just give it to them. “At the root of the racial wealth gap, and wealth inequality in general, is capital itself,” Hamilton told me. “Baby bonds are specifically aimed at giving people that seed capital, that asset that passively appreciates over their lifetime.” Read: In D.C., white families are on average 81 times richer than black ones Government investment and the magic of compound interest would eliminate much of the racial wealth gap, perhaps 70 or 80 percent over time. Naomi Zewde of the City University of New York studied a hypothetical baby-bond program that would provide rich babies $200 in assets and poor babies $50,000 in assets, with infants born to middle-class families getting scaled amounts in between. As of 2015, the median white young adult had a net worth of $46,000, versus $2,900 for the median black young adult. Had they been granted baby bonds at birth, white young adults would be worth $79,159 and black young adults $57,845, Zewde found. White kids would be roughly 40 percent wealthier than black kids, not 16 times as wealthy. Of course, baby bonds are not a magic bullet. Hamilton stressed the importance of considering reparations on their own terms. “I see reparations as a retrospective approach that is more direct, more parsimonious,” and race-specific, he said, whereas baby bonds are prospective, race-neutral, and “in perpetuity moves society toward becoming more egalitarian.” Eliminating student debt, ending mass incarceration, rationalizing the country’s system of health insurance, stopping covert redlining, ending poverty as measured by income—all of those are necessary elements of racial justice, and would be complementary policies to help make the country’s wealth distribution more equitable. One thing that will likely not do much to end the racial wealth gap is President Donald Trump’s Opportunity Zones initiative, which he has made the centerpiece of his election-year pitch to black voters. The program, part of the sweeping 2017 tax law, provides tax breaks for development projects in underinvested areas. When it passed, experts warned that the money would primarily go to real-estate developers working on existing projects, intensifying gentrification without aiding low-income neighborhoods. That seems to be precisely what is happening. The black-white wealth gap was wide when Trump became president, and might be even wider when he leaves office. Typical white households hold 10 times the wealth of typical black households. Closing much of that gap could take just a single policy and a sliver of the federal budget.

Parrott and Nicholas B. Martin Many aspects of New York’s workers’ comp benefit structure combine to deliver inadequate lost-worktime compensation to injured workers. Since 2007 workers' comp “reforms,” payments to or on behalf of workers have fallen relative to workers’ comp premiums while insurance company profits have soared. This report unravels the details and argues that the Empire State needs to take a fresh look at its workers’ comp system in order to restore the priority of fairly compensating victims of workplace injuries and ensure that businesses responsibly invest in enhancing workplace safety. This report updates several data series included in an earlier version released in April 2019. The Magnitude of Low-Paid Gig and Independent Contract Work in New York State By Lina Moe, James A. Parrott, and Jason Rochford In the wake of California's groundbreaking AB5 legislation, which subjects employers to an “ABC test” that narrows the guidelines for which companies can classify their workers as independent contractors, New York State lawmakers have begun exploring similar measures to better protect workers against misclassification and exploitation.This report will argue that the misclassification of workers as independent contractors is much broader than just the online platform sector, and that many of the largest low-paying industries utilize significant numbers of independent contractors who likely are misclassified. The report estimates that there are about 150,000 app-based independent contractors in New York that constitute about 17.5 percent of over 850,000 low-paid independent contractors in the state. Presentations An Earnings Standard for New York City’s App-dispatched FHV Drivers: Economic Analysis and Policy Assessment By James A. Parrott New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a $17.22 after-expense per hour minimum driver pay standard for app-dispatched FHV drivers in February 2019. The pay standard was the first in the nation for app drivers. Prior to the standard, 72 percent of all trips paid drivers less than $17.22 per hour, and 96 percent of all drivers had one or more trips per week paying less than the minimum. The pay standard formula incentivizes companies to make more efficient use of drivers’ time, reducing the time spent cruising while waiting for the next dispatch.  Minimum Wage Studies New York City’s $15 Minimum Wage and Restaurant Employment and Earnings By Lina Moe, James Parrott, and Yannet Lathrop This is the first assessment of restaurant employment and earnings over the entire period of New York City’s historic minimum wage increases, 2013-18. Contrary to fears of massive job losses, $20 Big Macs, and shuttered restaurants, we found a thriving industry. New York State’s Historic Disinvestment in Human Services since the Great Recession: The Impact in New York City and Around the State By James Parrott and Angela Butel Human services aid from New York State helps localities pay for direct services, including public assistance and services provided through nonprofits. In this report we examine New York State, New York City and county budget data to understand how State funding trends affect localities across the state and New York City in particular.

Two new reports argue that renewable energy and battery storage can make so-called peaker plants obsolete. Rachel Ramirez Published May 08, 2020 Topic Climate +             Equity Share/Republish Copy Link Republish Copy Link Email SMS X Facebook Republish Reddit LinkedIn Bluesky As the U.S. approaches another scorching summer , the power grid will be tested once again. Energy use typically spikes during heat waves due to the massive amount of electricity required by widespread air conditioning. This extra demand is met by so-called peaker plants, power plants that typically only run during these periods of peak demand. These plants can emit harmful pollutants like fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide into nearby communities — which are often low-income neighborhoods of color. Peaker plants are also expensive. In New York City, more than 600,000 families spend roughly six percent of their entire annual household income on energy payments, and peak electricity in particular is among the most expensive in the country. A new report has found that New Yorkers over the last decade have paid more than $4.5 billion in electricity bills to the private owners of the city’s peaker plants, just to keep those plants online in case they’re needed — even though they only operate between 90 and 500 hours a year. Even at the upper limit, that’s less than three weeks. This all means that the price tag for peak electricity in the Big Apple is 1300 percent higher than the average cost of electricity in the state. Over 1.2 million New Yorkers live within a one-mile radius of a peaker plant — so not only do they pay unusually high electricity bills, but they are also exposed to harmful pollutants produced by the same entities who receive those payments, according to the report. Many of these facilities are 50 or more years old, lack modern pollution controls, and run on dirty fuels like kerosene or oil at least part-time. Environmental justice advocates say that there’s another way. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one .

Here's How “Instead of ratepayer money going to fossil fuel interests, we want to see that go to renewable projects, to community solar projects, to energy storage and other clean energy initiatives,” said Annel Hernandez, associate director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance (NYC-EJA). When it comes to transitioning away from fossil fuels, peaker plants are the “lowest-hanging fruit, because they’re only powered during peak demand.” The new report, entitled “Dirty Energy, Big Money,” was published by the PEAK Coalition , which consists of New York City environmental justice groups NYC-EJA, UPROSE , and The Point CDC , as well as New York Lawyers for the Public Interest and Clean Energy Group . Their analysis found that about 85 percent of the last decade’s peak electricity payments were funneled to three private, out-of-state firms — a Boston hedge fund, a Houston fossil fuel generation company, and a New Jersey private equity firm — that own a large share of the oldest New York City peaker plants. These polluting plants are located in low-income neighborhoods of color, such as Brooklyn’s Sunset Park, a predominantly Chinese and Latino neighborhood, and the South Bronx, the country’s poorest congressional district and a predominantly black and brown neighborhood. In the South Bronx neighborhoods of Hunts Point and Longwood, asthma hospitalization rates are nearly double the city average. Peaker plant emissions during a severe summer heatwave can exacerbate this underlying burden. Dariella Rodriguez, director of community development for The Point CDC, a South Bronx nonprofit that is part of the PEAK Coalition, says that residents being stuck indoors during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgency of finding alternative solutions to existing peaker plants. “Especially in the South Bronx, in a community like Hunt’s Point, where we know we’re very vulnerable to heat, weak infrastructure, and also air quality, this is a moment to rethink how our city and our state can use the land, build clean infrastructure, and support groups that are engaging in creative ways to change their communities,” Rodriguez said.

A similar analysis released this month by Physicians, Scientists, and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE) shows that half of California’s 80 gas-fired peaker plants are located in what the state itself calls “disadvantaged communities,” based on socioeconomic, environmental, and health outcomes. California peaker plants disproportionately operate on days when smog levels already exceed federal standards, exacerbating local air quality and public health risks, according to the report. PSE said that it plans to release more results and data from other states such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona this month. The reports argue that renewable energy and battery storage are the best alternatives to replace fossil fuel-fired peaker plants. In California, for instance, the aging Oakland Power Plant will soon be replaced with a mix of solar and battery storage. In New York City, environmental advocates have been pushing to transform Rikers Island, which houses the city’s most notorious jail complex , into a green infrastructure hub that would replace the peaker plants in the southernmost peninsula of the Bronx. Both California and New York have already put out ambitious climate commitments to lower carbon emissions and phase out the use of fossil fuels, but environmental advocates say that government officials need the help of grassroots activists to achieve those targets. “For us, we want to see the transition happen equitably and quickly,” Hernandez said. “In New York City, with strong planning, strong community input, and a real commitment from city and state government, renewable energy and energy storage and distributed generation can get us to the reliability and resiliency that we need.” A message from All donations DOUBLED for a limited time Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Following lawsuits from former property owners and backlash from elected officials, the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) on Thursday said that is has put together a task force to modernize its controversial Third Party Transfer program. The announcement comes ahead of a City Council hearing on Monday about Third Party Transfer, under which HPD and the city’s tax collectors hand apartment buildings’ deeds to nonprofit caretakers in lieu of taking possession for unpaid taxes or water and sewer bills. “Our working group is going to look at the program overall, we’re going to look at it with fresh eyes and anything is on the table,” recently appointed HPD Commissioner Louise Carroll told THE CITY. Carroll is teaming up with the program’s most vocal critic in the Council, Robert Cornegy Jr. (D-Brooklyn), to lead a group of nonprofits and housing experts to review the program, which critics say unfairly targets shareholders in low-income co-ops and communities of color. Cornegy, who chairs the City Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, had called for a probe into the practice. “The Third Party Transfer program in and of itself, and in its intention, was a good program that stabilized for people who lived in apartments, give them good-quality, below-market rents and stabilized their quality of life,” he told THE CITY last month. He declined to comment Thursday on the formation of the task force he will co-chair.

Following lawsuits from former property owners and backlash from elected officials, the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) on Thursday said that is has put together a task force to modernize its controversial Third Party Transfer program. The announcement comes ahead of a City Council hearing on Monday about Third Party Transfer, under which HPD and the city’s tax collectors hand apartment buildings’ deeds to nonprofit caretakers in lieu of taking possession for unpaid taxes or water and sewer bills. “Our working group is going to look at the program overall, we’re going to look at it with fresh eyes and anything is on the table,” recently appointed HPD Commissioner Louise Carroll told THE CITY. Carroll is teaming up with the program’s most vocal critic in the Council, Robert Cornegy Jr. (D-Brooklyn), to lead a group of nonprofits and housing experts to review the program, which critics say unfairly targets shareholders in low-income co-ops and communities of color. Cornegy, who chairs the City Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, had called for a probe into the practice. “The Third Party Transfer program in and of itself, and in its intention, was a good program that stabilized for people who lived in apartments, give them good-quality, below-market rents and stabilized their quality of life,” he told THE CITY last month. He declined to comment Thursday on the formation of the task force he will co-chair. The new group includes several nonprofit developers that work with HPD and the Department of Finance to take over buildings foreclosed through Third Party Transfer, as well as Neighborhood Restore, which serves as an intermediary owner. It does not, however, include any co-op shareholders or their advocacy organizations.

By Libor Jany January 30, 2020 at 10:38AM Comment Gift Share Listen Minneapolis police officers will no longer ticket motorists for broken headlights or turn signals, instead handing out vouchers to pay for vehicle repairs under a new department policy unveiled Wednesday. The changes come roughly a year after a pitched debate at City Hall over a possible moratorium on certain traffic stops , with some council members seeing the move as a way to ease the racial disparities in rates of traffic stops. Others worried that it would only harm residents in poorer neighborhoods, where gun violence is prevalent. That debate came weeks after a community forum where residents aired their frustrations with what they saw as years of harassment and discrimination at the hands of police. At the time, police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he would study the issue, and in the months since has been meeting with senior staffers, crime analysts and community leaders to hear their advice on what to do to revamp the policy without endangering public safety. Under the new policy, instead of writing a ticket, officers will now have the option of issuing drivers a voucher from the Lights On! program — financed by the nonprofit group MicroGrants, which partners with local organizations to promote economic self-sufficiency among lower income residents, according to its website. The vouchers can be redeemed at participating auto shops to cover the costs of services such as replacing a bulb from a rear taillight. Exceptions include cases in which equipment violations result in a crash or "harm to another," according to the new guidelines. Motorists with outstanding warrants or who have committed some other criminal act can still be arrested after being pulled over. "All MPD employees conducting motor vehicle stops for equipment violations shall issue a Lights ON! Coupon in Lieu of traffic citations, when available and applicable," reads the new policy, which goes into effect Saturday. "If a Coupon is issued, then the officer shall advise the driver or recipient of the location in which the repair can be made." Minneapolis police began participating in the Lights On! program a few years ago, along with more than a dozen other Twin Cities police departments. Minneapolis' new policy covers an expanded list of equipment violations and requires officers to give out vouchers in nearly all cases. "Fixing minor issues such as a broken brake light can go a long way toward breaking the cycle of poverty — individuals who ignore a fix-it ticket are at risk of having their license suspended," the agency said in a news release. Even before the new policy was announced, Minneapolis Police Department statistics showed that traffic stops for equipment violations dropped 27% last year, officials say. Department officials said they hoped the changes would free up officers to spend time on more serious crime-fighting duties. "It takes much longer to issue a citation [than] to give a coupon," the department tweeted Wednesday, in response to a question about the new policy. Civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong applauded the move, calling it a step in the right direction toward reversing age-old racial disparities between black and white motorists. "Ultimately, we want police officers to be problem solvers and not gateways into the justice system for poor people of color," she said. But Pete Gamades, a community organizer, said that while he appreciated the chief's willingness to listen to the community's concerns, he didn't think the new guidelines went far enough. "How does that reduce the racial disparities in the stops to begin with, and I don't see that this policy change does that," Gamades said. "One of our goals was to eliminate the stops completely, and potentially mail a coupon to the owner of the car, and hence remove that interaction with the cop that could not end well for either side." For many people struggling to make ends meet, even the cost of fixing a broken taillight can harm their economic well-being, while sending them "deeper into the criminal justice system," Levy Armstrong said. A 2018 Hennepin County Public Defender's Office report found that more than half of motorists stopped citywide for equipment violations were black, even though blacks make up only about a fifth of the city's population. The disparity was particularly glaring in the ethnically diverse neighborhoods of north Minneapolis, where the study found that 80% of drivers pulled over were black, compared with 12% who were white. At the same time, traffic enforcement has dropped by nearly 70% over the past decade as the department has moved away from a more aggressive style of policing that critics said had a negligible impact on crime while targeting minorities.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate A Preliminary Analysis of the City’s Payroll Shows Troubling Gender, Racial and Ethnic Pay Disparities October 29, 2020 Women City Workers and Workers of Color Earn Thousands of Dollars Less A Year Than Male Workers New York, NY – A preliminary analysis of anonymized and publicly available New York City employee payroll data conducted by the New York City Council shows significant gender, racial, and ethnic pay disparities in the city’s workforce, Speaker Corey Johnson and the Women’s Caucus of the New York City Council announced on Thursday. The analysis of salaries of roughly 180,000, full-time city workers shows that male employees roughly average about $4,500 a year more than female employees. The analysis also found that Black city workers average about $7,600 a year less than white workers, while Asians tend to make $6,500 a year less than white employees. Additionally, the analysis found that non-Hispanic/non-Latino workers roughly average about $8,700 a year more than Hispanic/Latino. This data was made available in response to Local Law 18 of 2019, sponsored by Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo and Council Member Daneek Miller, Chair of the Civil Service and Labor Committee, which was enacted last year in an effort to identify and address pay disparities among city workers. Local Law 18 requires the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) to annually issue anonymized payroll data on the municipal workforce. The data was released this month after being delayed by COVID. It can be found following this link . It is required to be released publicly every year. Per the law, it should include information on gender, ethnicity and race to allow for an analysis on potential pay disparities. The law also requires that the Council, as part of its Charter-mandated oversight role on city agencies, get access to all employment level data of City workers for 90 days to conduct its own statistical analysis. This access will allow us to go deeper than the public data and to get at what factors may be causing these disparities while helping us identify ways to address them. The Council, which has never had access to this level of data before, expects this deeper analysis to be complete in the first quarter of 2021. The Council analysis used a mixed-effects statistical model to determine the disparities. The analysis factored in the following variables: job category, race, ethnicity and relevant city agency. The analysis does not address job titles, years of experience, level of education, or previous NYC employment, which are important factors to determine why women or people of color are making less. But this analysis does tell us that overall, the City is paying men and white employees more. The Council will be able to examine those factors and more in our next analysis when we have access to significantly more data, per Local Law 18. Studies show that gender, racial and ethnic wage gaps are a serious problem. New York women with full-time, year-round jobs earn $6,735 less than their male counterparts, or $.88 cents on the dollar, according to a 2019 study by the National Partnership for Women & Families . That figure gets even worse for New York women of color, according to the same study which found that Latina and Black women on average make $30,023 and $24,360 less, respectively, than men. Local Law 18 of 2019 was crafted in response to the lawsuit the Communications Workers of America Local 1180 filed against the Bloomberg Administration over racial and gender pay discrimination in 2013. CWA alleged that the city had been systematically underpaying women and employees of color who held the “Administrative Management” title. As proof, the CWA pointed out that in 1978 – when most people who held the Administrative Management title were men – the typical salary was the equivalent of about $92,000. As it became a title increasingly held by women, the pay fell to around $53,000. The de Blasio Administration eventually settled with CWA, but the settlement only covered one job title. The Council’s legislation is a long-term effort to right historic wrongs across all city agencies. “These preliminary findings are troubling and show exactly why Local Law 18 of 2019 was so important. For too long, the many contributions of women and people of color have been short-changed. It’s incumbent on all of us to make sure we are working to right those wrongs, and address the biases and discriminatory practices that contribute to pay and opportunity gaps,” said Council Speaker Corey Johnson . “Unfortunately, this is no surprise. We knew pay disparities existed when the CWA Local 1180 filed its lawsuit against the Bloomberg Administration in 2013. Our stats proved it, which is why the de Blasio Administration settled our lawsuit in March 2018, and a judge signed off on the final terms in July 2019. We are proud to have worked with the Council to pass Local Law 18 of 2019 to address the issue of pay disparity in the city work force. There is a history in New York City and this country where women and women of color have experienced racism, sexism, and all the other -isms that have led to them being denied equality on the job in both pay and status. Systemic bias in a city our mayor calls progressive is unacceptable. It’s also unacceptable that those in power who are able to set policies to address these problems refuse to do so. We implore Mayor de Blasio to commit to seriously addressing pay parity once and for all,” said Communications Workers of America Local 1180 President Gloria Middleton . “In order to create a more equitable world for women, especially working women of color like myself, we must have data accessible for the public that sheds light on the disparities we have been suffering through for generations. We continue to bear the burden of childbearing, raising families, taking care of elderly parents, all the while juggling a full-time job where we do not get compensated for the same work that our male counterparts do. I am eager to see how my bill, Local Law 18 of 2019 paves the way toward true equity in New York City by shining a light on these historic disparities. Thank you to Speaker Johnson for his unrelenting leadership and commitment to working for all New Yorkers,” said Council Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo . “COVID-19 and other crises have highlighted the adverse impact of systemic racism on the upward mobility of New Yorkers of color, particularly our Black and Brown women. These initial findings demand that we institute real reforms to address racial bias and pay discrimination within our City’s workforce. I look forward to the presentation of the Council’s final analysis,” said Council Member I. Daneek Miller, Chair of the Committee on Civil Service and Labor . “Your gender, race or ethnicity should not predetermine the salary you earn in this city and in this country, but sadly we know that in reality it does far too often. I am grateful that the Council is working to address these long-term issues, and that we are beginning this work by looking at our own municipal workforce. Women and New Yorkers of color are on the frontlines every day in our city and deserve nothing less than equal pay for equal work,” said Council Member Vanessa L. Gibson, Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus. “The municipal workforce, a dedicated and culturally diverse group of individuals, has been the driving force behind ‘The City That Never Sleeps.’ Every day, thousands of New Yorkers work tirelessly to care for our families, and it is our turn to care for theirs. We cannot create a more equitable city without ending pay disparities within our own ranks. We need to end the systemic inequalities that perpetuate economic, food, and housing insecurity citywide. I am proud to be amongst a legislative body that has enacted legislation to ensure fair treatment and economic justice in the workplace,” said Council Member Farah N. Louis, Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus. “This administration has repeatedly highlighted socio-economic inequities across our city, but it must lead by example. Every employee, no matter their background, deserves fairness. The City must address all salary inequities within its workforce now,” said Council Member Helen Rosenthal, Chair, Committee on Women & Gender Equity. “Unequal and unfair pay has prevailed for far too long. Pervasive pay gaps continue to hurt women and people of color in measurable ways. A concerted effort must be made to effect bold change across the board. All employees must be compensated equally,” said Council Member Adrienne Adams . “Equal pay for equal work is the hallmark of a just society. Pay disparities based on race, ethnicity, and gender run contrary to our values as a city, and contrary to the values that the late Justice Ginsburg fought for. As we work to remedy the disparities laid bare by the COVID pandemic, we must also address these inequities with urgency. We must develop and implement a remedy, so that the work of all New Yorkers is honored and valued,” said Council Member Deborah Rose . “The fact that income disparities in the City’s workforce might impact New Yorkers by virtue of their gender, racial, and ethnic lines in the year 2020 is extremely unfortunate . As a proud co-sponsor of local law 18, my interest is and has always been to ensure that we are doing everything in our legislative authority to do away with any and all inequities,” said Council Member Diana Ayala. “During my tenure as a Council Member, I have used my voice to elevate the need to increase the salary of council staffers and have supported lifting the pay of workers throughout New York City. For too long, spanning too many generations, Black and Latina women have fought against racial, economic and health inequities in this city, this state and this country. As we examine pay inequities more closely, these findings are extremely troubling. According to a study conducted in 2019, by the National Partnership for Women and Families, Latina and Black women make $30,023 and $24,360 less, respectively, than men on average. As the richest city in the nation, we can and must do better to change these dynamics. I support Speaker Corey Johnson for his efforts to address these pay inequities for our workers at City Council and other workers throughout our city,” said Council Member Inez Barron. “I look forward to further examining the data and working with my colleagues to enact meaningful legislation to combat racism here at home. The pandemic is a sobering reminder of the very real consequences of systemic racism, as Black and Latinx New Yorkers have been dying from COVID-19 at roughly twice the rate of their white counterparts. This preliminary data presents an opportunity to create a long-term solution to bridge gaps in pay equity and it is important that we act immediately,” said Council Member Margaret S. Chin . “I want to thank the Speaker and my fellow Council Members for championing wage equality for all, and for conducting this preliminary analysis that shows men are making more than women, and white New York City employees are making more than workers of color. As one of only two Latinas in the City Council, I understand first-hand the challenges facing far too many New Yorkers fighting for their worth and their livelihoods, and I implore City Hall to take seriously the issue of pay parity and begin doing the hard work to address it immediately,” said Council Member Carlina Rivera . ### A Preliminary Analysis of the City’s Payroll Shows Troubling Gender, Racial and Ethnic Pay Disparities October 29, 2020 Women City Workers and Workers of Color Earn Thousands of Dollars Less A Year Than Male Workers New York, NY – A preliminary analysis of anonymized and publicly available New York City employee payroll data conducted by the New York City Council shows significant gender, racial, and ethnic pay disparities in the city’s workforce, Speaker Corey Johnson and the Women’s Caucus of the New York City Council announced on Thursday. The analysis of salaries of roughly 180,000, full-time city workers shows that male employees roughly average about $4,500 a year more than female employees. The analysis also found that Black city workers average about $7,600 a year less than white workers, while Asians tend to make $6,500 a year less than white employees. Additionally, the analysis found that non-Hispanic/non-Latino workers roughly average about $8,700 a year more than Hispanic/Latino. This data was made available in response to Local Law 18 of 2019, sponsored by Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo and Council Member Daneek Miller, Chair of the Civil Service and Labor Committee, which was enacted last year in an effort to identify and address pay disparities among city workers. Local Law 18 requires the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) to annually issue anonymized payroll data on the municipal workforce. The data was released this month after being delayed by COVID. It can be found following this link . It is required to be released publicly every year. Per the law, it should include information on gender, ethnicity and race to allow for an analysis on potential pay disparities. The law also requires that the Council, as part of its Charter-mandated oversight role on city agencies, get access to all employment level data of City workers for 90 days to conduct its own statistical analysis. This access will allow us to go deeper than the public data and to get at what factors may be causing these disparities while helping us identify ways to address them. The Council, which has never had access to this level of data before, expects this deeper analysis to be complete in the first quarter of 2021. The Council analysis used a mixed-effects statistical model to determine the disparities. The analysis factored in the following variables: job category, race, ethnicity and relevant city agency. The analysis does not address job titles, years of experience, level of education, or previous NYC employment, which are important factors to determine why women or people of color are making less. But this analysis does tell us that overall, the City is paying men and white employees more. The Council will be able to examine those factors and more in our next analysis when we have access to significantly more data, per Local Law 18. Studies show that gender, racial and ethnic wage gaps are a serious problem. New York women with full-time, year-round jobs earn $6,735 less than their male counterparts, or $.88 cents on the dollar, according to a 2019 study by the National Partnership for Women & Families . That figure gets even worse for New York women of color, according to the same study which found that Latina and Black women on average make $30,023 and $24,360 less, respectively, than men. Local Law 18 of 2019 was crafted in response to the lawsuit the Communications Workers of America Local 1180 filed against the Bloomberg Administration over racial and gender pay discrimination in 2013. CWA alleged that the city had been systematically underpaying women and employees of color who held the “Administrative Management” title. As proof, the CWA pointed out that in 1978 – when most people who held the Administrative Management title were men – the typical salary was the equivalent of about $92,000. As it became a title increasingly held by women, the pay fell to around $53,000. The de Blasio Administration eventually settled with CWA, but the settlement only covered one job title. The Council’s legislation is a long-term effort to right historic wrongs across all city agencies. “These preliminary findings are troubling and show exactly why Local Law 18 of 2019 was so important. For too long, the many contributions of women and people of color have been short-changed. It’s incumbent on all of us to make sure we are working to right those wrongs, and address the biases and discriminatory practices that contribute to pay and opportunity gaps,” said Council Speaker Corey Johnson . “Unfortunately, this is no surprise. We knew pay disparities existed when the CWA Local 1180 filed its lawsuit against the Bloomberg Administration in 2013. Our stats proved it, which is why the de Blasio Administration settled our lawsuit in March 2018, and a judge signed off on the final terms in July 2019. We are proud to have worked with the Council to pass Local Law 18 of 2019 to address the issue of pay disparity in the city work force. There is a history in New York City and this country where women and women of color have experienced racism, sexism, and all the other -isms that have led to them being denied equality on the job in both pay and status. Systemic bias in a city our mayor calls progressive is unacceptable. It’s also unacceptable that those in power who are able to set policies to address these problems refuse to do so. We implore Mayor de Blasio to commit to seriously addressing pay parity once and for all,” said Communications Workers of America Local 1180 President Gloria Middleton . “In order to create a more equitable world for women, especially working women of color like myself, we must have data accessible for the public that sheds light on the disparities we have been suffering through for generations. We continue to bear the burden of childbearing, raising families, taking care of elderly parents, all the while juggling a full-time job where we do not get compensated for the same work that our male counterparts do. I am eager to see how my bill, Local Law 18 of 2019 paves the way toward true equity in New York City by shining a light on these historic disparities. Thank you to Speaker Johnson for his unrelenting leadership and commitment to working for all New Yorkers,” said Council Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo . “COVID-19 and other crises have highlighted the adverse impact of systemic racism on the upward mobility of New Yorkers of color, particularly our Black and Brown women. These initial findings demand that we institute real reforms to address racial bias and pay discrimination within our City’s workforce. I look forward to the presentation of the Council’s final analysis,” said Council Member I. Daneek Miller, Chair of the Committee on Civil Service and Labor . “Your gender, race or ethnicity should not predetermine the salary you earn in this city and in this country, but sadly we know that in reality it does far too often. I am grateful that the Council is working to address these long-term issues, and that we are beginning this work by looking at our own municipal workforce. Women and New Yorkers of color are on the frontlines every day in our city and deserve nothing less than equal pay for equal work,” said Council Member Vanessa L. Gibson, Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus. “The municipal workforce, a dedicated and culturally diverse group of individuals, has been the driving force behind ‘The City That Never Sleeps.’ Every day, thousands of New Yorkers work tirelessly to care for our families, and it is our turn to care for theirs. We cannot create a more equitable city without ending pay disparities within our own ranks. We need to end the systemic inequalities that perpetuate economic, food, and housing insecurity citywide. I am proud to be amongst a legislative body that has enacted legislation to ensure fair treatment and economic justice in the workplace,” said Council Member Farah N. Louis, Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus. “This administration has repeatedly highlighted socio-economic inequities across our city, but it must lead by example. Every employee, no matter their background, deserves fairness. The City must address all salary inequities within its workforce now,” said Council Member Helen Rosenthal, Chair, Committee on Women & Gender Equity. “Unequal and unfair pay has prevailed for far too long. Pervasive pay gaps continue to hurt women and people of color in measurable ways. A concerted effort must be made to effect bold change across the board. All employees must be compensated equally,” said Council Member Adrienne Adams . “Equal pay for equal work is the hallmark of a just society. Pay disparities based on race, ethnicity, and gender run contrary to our values as a city, and contrary to the values that the late Justice Ginsburg fought for. As we work to remedy the disparities laid bare by the COVID pandemic, we must also address these inequities with urgency. We must develop and implement a remedy, so that the work of all New Yorkers is honored and valued,” said Council Member Deborah Rose . “The fact that income disparities in the City’s workforce might impact New Yorkers by virtue of their gender, racial, and ethnic lines in the year 2020 is extremely unfortunate . As a proud co-sponsor of local law 18, my interest is and has always been to ensure that we are doing everything in our legislative authority to do away with any and all inequities,” said Council Member Diana Ayala. “During my tenure as a Council Member, I have used my voice to elevate the need to increase the salary of council staffers and have supported lifting the pay of workers throughout New York City. For too long, spanning too many generations, Black and Latina women have fought against racial, economic and health inequities in this city, this state and this country. As we examine pay inequities more closely, these findings are extremely troubling. According to a study conducted in 2019, by the National Partnership for Women and Families, Latina and Black women make $30,023 and $24,360 less, respectively, than men on average.

and Provide Community Boards with additional time to review ULURP applications certified for public review by DCP between June 1 and July 15, from the current 60-day review period to 90 days for applications certified in June, and to 75 days for applications certified between July 1 and July 15. Shall this proposal be adopted? The Way Things Are Now ULURP Pre-Certification Notice Period. There are rules that govern what sorts of buildings may be built on every block of city land, how high those buildings may go, and how they may be used. The city has a procedure for reviewing and approving “land use applications,” which are required when builders or developers seek exceptions to these rules, such as seeking to change the zoning of a specific area from residential to commercial, or getting approval to build structures that don’t strictly conform to current zoning regulations. They are also required when the city sells, buys, or leases property. This review procedure is known as ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure), and it is meant to allow community boards, borough presidents, the City Planning Commission, the City Council, and the public a chance to review and weigh in on these requests. Currently, this public approval process does not begin until the Department of City Planning (DCP) has reviewed, possibly changed, and finally certified that the land use application is complete. During the period the application is being reviewed by the DCP, the developer is not required to notify or seek any input from the borough president, community board, or the public in the neighborhood that will be affected. Additional ULURP Review Time for Community Boards. When a community board receives a land use application that has been certified to be complete by DCP, it has 60 days to notify the community, hold a public hearing, draft and vote on its recommendations about the project, and submit them to the relevant borough president and the City Planning Commission. Some community boards do not meet in July and August because a significant number of their members are on vacation, so they cannot hold hearings, draft recommendations, or gather a majority of their members to vote during those months.

DCP will be required to send a detailed project summary of each land use application, including the proposed location and purpose of the proposed development or action, to the relevant borough president, borough board, and community board at least 30 days before DCP certifies that the application is complete, and must publish the summary on its website no more than five days later. The land use applications that are certified by DCP must be consistent with these detailed summaries. Additional ULURP Review Time for Community Boards.

Statements Supporting Proposal Statements Supporting Proposal Betty Diana Arce This proposition is very important to the work of community boards in dealing with land use and zoning issues. It is difficult to get a quorum over the summer months to review a ULURP application. This proposal would allow timely review of the ULURP application and opportunity to submit comments. Peg Breen, President, The New York Landmarks Conservancy Proposal #5 would give Borough Presidents, Community Boards and the public advanced notice of development proposed for their neighborhoods and the ability to engage developers in possibly reshaping plans. Projects are often firmly set, and more difficult to change, once the ULURP clock begins. Allowing volunteer Community Boards additional review time during the summer is just common sense. Citizens Union Citizens Union recommends a yes vote on Question 5, while also wishing the Charter Revision Commission had gone further with its land use reform proposals. Question 5 requires the Department of City Planning to transmit a project summary to the borough president, borough board and community board at least 30 days before a Uniform Land Use Review Procedure application is certified. It also provides more time during the summer for community boards to review ULURP applications. Eric Dinowitz, Special Education Teacher I fully support the proposed changes to ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure). ULURP is intended to allow communities to review projects and have a meaningful say in any changes to zoning within our communities. Zoning laws should protect our communities and our environment from overzealous developers, and new projects that seek to build outside of current zoning regulations need input from the community to ensure that these projects meet the needs of the area in which they are built. The charter change would give neighborhoods additional information on proposed projects and allow community boards more time to review projects. This would give communities more of a voice in future development to meet a community's growing need. The power should be with our communities, not real estate developers, and the proposed additional time for evaluation would give more of that power back to our communities. Ben Kallos, New York City Council Member Neighborhoods only get to weigh in on the city planning process at the very end. Currently, Community Boards are only given 60 days to hear and vote to approve or disapprove zoning proposals without the ability to make meaningful changes. In their final report, the Commission noted my testimony, along with that of Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and Community Board 8 Manhattan, calling for Community Boards to be included earlier in the city planning process. This question would do that by giving the Community Boards at least 30 days to engage with zoning proposals before they are certified so that meaningful changes from the neighborhood can be included. For Question 5 on Land Use to begin community engagement at the start of city planning, vote YES. Susan Lerner, Executive Director, Common Cause/NY In New York City, all proposals relating to potential rezonings and real estate projects are required to go through a land review process called ULURP. CCNY supports a top-to-bottom reworking of the ULURP process, one that meaningfully incorporates public input. The current process however, often leaves insufficient time for substantive community engagement on decisions that can have sweeping ramifications for neighborhoods across New York City. Question 5 gives communities and elected officials more time to evaluate potential changes to their neighborhoods before the review process begins. After all, if developers have plans to dramatically alter the makeup and character of neighborhoods across the City, communities and city representatives deserve to have adequate time to assess and scrutinize their proposals. Emmanuel Martinez, Banking Proposition 5: As Chair of Community Board 7, and whose community is seeing first hand the various residential developments, having extended time to review new ULURP applications would greatly increase community engagement on the structure of our neighborhood. It is understood developers do not like road blocks or limitations on their projects, but by extending the time for community boards to deliberate on the specific project will, overtime, change residents perception of real estate developments to a positive of one.. Furthermore, as demographics continue to change and the population becomes younger, it’ll allow our younger working class demographic to join in the conversation. Janie Medina, Librarian Yes, extra time is important. Elizabeth Mooney, Retired Journalist A good improvement on current policy. New York Immigration Coalition New York Immigration Coalition Position: Support Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) specifies a timeframe and sequence for public review and approval of land use applications by community boards, borough presidents, the City Planning Commission, and ultimately, the City Council. These proposals help the city and communities make decisions and weigh in on complicated land use projects by requiring the Department of City Planning to send detailed project summaries of land use items to the affected community board(s), borough president, and borough board earlier; and giving community boards more time to review projects, hold public hearings, and issue recommendations. Cyrille Njikeng, Executive Director, CUNY USS 5 is very important for Community Boards. It is difficult to get quorum over the summer months to approve/disprove a ULURP. This provision would give us more time to review the ULURP and submit comments in the event an application comes to us during such time. Denise Relf, Consultant It can be challenging to meet and discuss matters as a board during summer months. The extra time would help us make decisions that would best serve our community as a whole. Chad Royer The community-at-large has been often left out of this process. It isn't fair for the residents to be notified of a building or structure whose theme of occupancy can create more problems and hardship to the community. The community board needs an opportunity and adequate time to review any proposed structure so that both sides have a fair opportunity in stating their position and raising issues that the occupancy can create. Adding a public residence in an overcrowded neighborhood where parking is already difficult where its neighborhood residence do not get priority is not right. Hiring vendors from outside the neighborhood to help build something that may not be favorable to the neighborhood is wrong. Our community deserves answers and fair treatment. Barbara Stronczer, Community Activist As a member of a community board, I am in favor of extending the time period for review of a ULURP issue during the summer months. It is important for both community boards and local residents to have the opportunity to comment on these issues which often have a major impact on local neighborhoods. Bella Wang, Board of Directors, League of Women Voters of the City of New York We recommend a “yes” vote on this ballot item. These ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Plan) amendments don't come even close to achieving the type of reforms that planning advocates have promoted over the years. However, they are both small steps that extend community involvement in land use planning. The Borough Presidents and Community Boards have long complained that they have inadequate time to thoroughly review applications or consider a development project once the ULURP clock begins to run. This is particularly critical in the summer months when community boards may not meet, or are unable to secure a quorum to vote on projects. Statements Opposing Proposal Statements Opposing Proposal Tom Angotti, Professor Emeritus of Urban Policy & Planning This proposal falls far short of the major changes needed to equip community boards to engage meaningfully in the land use review process, including the critical period before certification. "Tweaking" the Charter is not enough. Without requiring comprehensive planning as a framework for land use decision-making, without insuring that all community boards have professional planners and adequate financing, such minor adjustments would force them to stretch their limited resources even further. The community board vote has to be weighted equally with the other levels of government and that requires a meaningful charter revision. Jeffrey Geary, Architect this item doesn't leave enough time for comment, the way the Community Boards typically meet, they break for the summer, as well as civic staff, so if a proposal from DCP comes to a board/office at the end of June, the members might not look at it till September and 30 days is already over, and I have seen the Department take advantage of this little logistical nugget time and time again, the timeframe should be 90 days, Agency projects are typically years in the making and anything that important to require comment by a CB or other agency, can wait 90 days Michael Lewyn, Law Professor, Touro Law Center Ballot Question 5 will give community boards even more time than they currently have to delay attempts to create new housing for our apartment-starved city. As a result, it will be even harder than it is now to build more apartments. Housing delayed is housing denied! Manhattan Libertarian Party We oppose any further delays and obstacles to development such as these proposed Charter amendments. Property owners have a fundamental right to use and develop their property that should not be arbitrarily suppressed because of community opposition and the veto of a single elected councilmember, as often occurs under the current ULURP process. Partly because of our current restrictive zoning and our nearly impossible processes to navigate it, NYC has built relatively few new buildings over the past two decades despite a huge increase in demand to live and work in NYC. We cannot allow this crisis to continue, much less make it worse, as these proposed amendments would. Open New York Open New York strongly opposes Ballot Question #5 for Land Use. The provision would cause needless delays to much needed housing. At a time when New Yorkers struggle with a severe housing shortage and rents peak at all-time highs, extended delays rub salt into the wound. The question intends to extend the delay that projects have to go through from 60 days to 90 days. Housing delayed is housing denied. ULURP is already one of the longest review processes in the US, taking up to eight months in the best of circumstances. The result: higher development costs, cancelled projects, and increased rents. Instead of holding projects hostage to their vacations, community boards should act promptly and maintain their schedules. Community boards have often served to amplify the voices of people who want to freeze the city in amber, rather than confronting an affordability crisis that is creating new rent burdened and homeless households every day. They have attempted to sabotage and derail projects that would help address these issues. Giving them a head start and guaranteeing delays every summer would only exacerbate a housing crisis that threatens to make our city even more unequal. William Thomas, Marketing Analyst New York is currently in the midst of a crippling housing shortage that has caused rents to skyrocket and resulted in historic levels of homelessness. Adding more systemic delays to our land use processes, as Question 5 proposes, will only make it harder to build new homes and ultimately make the problem worse. New Yorkers should vote no on Question 5. Jay Weiser, Law Professor Every new ULURP requirement creates opportunities for delay. It makes housing even more difficult to build in a city whose approval process already generates obscene delays. ULURP is already one of the longest review processes in the US, taking up to eight months in the best of circumstances. The result: New York City has some of the highest housing costs in the country. Ballot Question #5 would add up to 30 days before an application can be certified for public review, and 60-75 days for community board review over the summer. Every additional requirement becomes an opportunity for additional Not-In-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY) litigation, compounding the delay and expense. More delay and higher costs mean more cancelled projects and less new housing. Less housing means higher rents. Community boards should expedite projects, not delay them, and advocate for the future of the city instead of freezing it in place. Community boards should maintain their schedules through the summer, so that they can act promptly and approve more housing. That means voting No on Question #5.

About the project The Brooklyn Bus Network Redesign is an ambitious plan to improve bus travel for Brooklyn riders. The Draft Plan, released on December 1, 2022, reimagines the current Brooklyn bus network. The proposed network has routes, stops, and frequencies that reflect customer priorities. Our goal is to meet the needs of current and future customers. Much of what is in the Draft Plan is similar to today’s Brooklyn bus network. However, there are many proposals to improve the network for our customers. We have improved the network by simplifying it, straightening routes, creating new connections, strengthening interborough service, adjusting frequencies, and right-sizing the distance between bus stops. Project benefits Improved connections and a simplified network to decrease travel times and make trips simpler Improved intra- and inter-borough connections, which were identified as high priorities by Brooklyn riders Increased frequencies to create a better all-day frequent network to meet customer needs Better balanced stop spacing to speed up buses and improve reliability Bus Priority Projects on targeted corridors will maximize travel time savings and improve quality of service Next steps Beginning in January 2023, the MTA hosted 50 public events and workshops on the Draft Plan to gather additional input from Brooklyn bus riders and residents. This input is informing and shaping the Proposed Final Plan. Planning and scheduling work for the Brooklyn redesign based on your feedback is ongoing.

Gotham Gazette The Place for New York Policy and politics Past Stories Opinion Donate Connect with us Twitter Facebook CITY CITY For Next Steps in City's 'Green New Deal' and Covid Recovery, Coalition Offers Plan for 100,000 Climate Jobs October 20,  2020 | by Samar Khurshid An NYC Green New Deal announcement (photo: Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography) Though the coronavirus pandemic has caused widespread devastation for New York, it has hurt some communities more than others. New Yorkers of color have been more likely to die from the virus and, despite making up a larger share of so-called essential workers, have been more likely to lose their jobs because of the outbreak’s economic recession. With the city still in the process of a somewhat halting “reopening” and attempting to rebuild its struggling economy, a coalition of environmental justice advocates, labor unions, faith leaders, and elected officials is calling for an economic recovery plan that they estimate would create more than 100,000 jobs in three years, prioritizing communities of color with environmentally sound investments that can also meet the city’s goals of fighting climate change. The $16.2 billion plan, the “Climate And Community Stimulus Platform,” will be released in a virtual news conference on Tuesday afternoon by the Climate Works for All coalition, which is made up of more than 50 organizations. The coalition is coordinated by The Alliance for a Greater New York (ALIGN). The coalition will be joined by City Council Members Costa Constantinides, Antonio Reynoso, Ben Kallos, Brad Lander, Justin Brannan, Mark Levine, and Carlos Menchaca, along with several leaders from prominent labor unions and environmental advocacy groups. Comptroller Scott Stringer, a leading 2021 mayoral candidate, has also expressed support for the plan, according to ALIGN. The detailed plan proposes a broad strategy of economic development focused on the environment, climate resiliency, and green jobs through investments in renewable energy, housing infrastructure, green public transportation systems, manufacturing, resiliency infrastructure, public waste management and workforce training. It would build upon previously passed city laws and programs, some of which ALIGN previously fought for. It envisions, for example, spending $7 billion on energy-efficient retrofits at public housing developments and affordable housing buildings, creating more than 42,210 jobs in the process, according to the group’s estimates. Investing $3 billion in climate resilience projects and developing green infrastructure on public land could create another 28,485 jobs, it says, pointing to projects like Northwest Resiliency Park in Hoboken, New Jersey and the Bluebelt Program in Staten Island. The plan also expresses support for the Renewable Rikers proposal, which would replace the Rikers Island jail complex, which is slated for closure, with multi-use renewable infrastructure including energy, waste treatment and agriculture projects. The jobs it would create would cover about 15% of the city’s currently unemployed workforce, the report estimates, and it would be funded through a combination of state, local and federal funds. As of September, the city’s unemployment rate was 13.9%, down from 16.2% in August but six points higher than the national unemployment rate, according to the comptroller’s office. “We hear elected officials and candidates talking a lot about addressing income inequality and climate change,” said Maritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of ALIGN, in a phone interview. “And what we're trying to do with this particular report is just to show that when state legislators and city legislators, particularly, are investing in the right things, we actually can get to that goal.” Silva-Farrell said the plan would build on and complement policies already put into effect by the city and state. In April 2019, the City Council and Mayor Bill de Blasio approved the Climate Mobilization Act, what they called a New York City Green New Deal program, which included emissions caps on large buildings, mandated the installation of green roofs on city buildings, and created incentives for renewable energy projects, among other measures. At the state level, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act was also passed last year, and sets the state on a path to a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050, mandating that 70% of energy needs are fulfilled by renewable sources by 2030 and that the entire electric sector is carbon-emissions free by 2040. “We do see that there is an opening, an opportunity right now for our economy to shift to a green economy that will actually be a just transition,” Silva-Farrell said, noting that in communities of color, decades of environmental racism have led to worse public health outcomes for residents, exacerbating their vulnerability to the coronavirus and contributing to greater unemployment. According to a New York Times analysis from June, Black and Latino New Yorkers were twice as likely as white New Yorkers to die of COVID-19. About 75% of all frontline workers in the pandemic are people of color, according to data from Comptroller Stringer’s office. The coalition’s plan depends largely on major capital investments in infrastructure projects, which are widely seen as one of the most effective drivers of economic growth from a recession. But Mayor de Blasio has made significant cuts in the city’s capital plan to reduce city spending amid a massive budget deficit caused by the pandemic’s hit on tax revenue, though some question whether those cuts are prudent given their impact on the city’s annual expense budget is minimal. The Climate And Community Stimulus Platform would create thousands of union jobs with strong labor and wage protections, it says. Silva-Farrell and the coalition hope that as candidates run for mayor and City Council in the 2021 city election cycle, the plan will help propel the debate about the city’s recovery. “The pandemic is exacerbating the inequalities in our city,” she said. “And if anyone is looking to be elected to be mayor, they must look to address those concerns and think about a jobs plan that addresses those issues, particularly when it comes to climate change and job creation and inequality.” “When we talk about renewing our economy, we're actually looking at this report as a source for us to uproot not only income inequality within our city,” she added, “but also a shift in the way our economy works. Prioritizing our environment, prioritizing our communities, particularly Black and brown communities.” *** by Samar Khurshid, senior reporter, Gotham Gazette @samarkhurshid @GothamGazette Read more by this writer.

Below we share insights about homeownership patterns in New York City, drawing on the recently released HMDA data together with 2018 American Community Survey and up-to-date foreclosure data. Homeownership rate continues to vary by geography and race In 2018, the New York City homeownership rate was 33 percent, but it varied by borough. The homeownership rate in Staten Island was 69 percent, far closer to the national rate (64%) than any other borough. The Bronx had the lowest homeownership rate at 18 percent, approximately 45 percentage points lower than the national rate. Queens had a homeownership rate of 45 percent, Brooklyn 30 percent, and Manhattan 24 percent.  Homeownership rates also vary across racial lines. While 44 percent of Asian households and 43 percent of white households own their homes, only 27 percent and 17 percent of Black and Hispanic households own their homes, respectively.   Cost burden is not limited to renter households: Over 40 percent of New York City homeowners with mortgages were cost burdened The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines moderate home cost burden as a household spending 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs, and severe home cost burden as a household spending 50 percent or more of their income on housing costs. While households with mortgages were more likely to be cost burdened than those without mortgages, about one in five households without mortgages are either moderately or severely cost burdened. Notably, about half of cost burdened homeowner households were severely cost burdened. Ten years after the foreclosure crisis, the share of severely cost burdened owner-occupied households with mortgages declined to about 22 percent in 2018 (from 27 percent in 2008). Several factors could have driven this decline. One possibility is that the foreclosure crisis pushed many owners out of the homeownership market entirely, leaving a remaining pool who were less cost burdened. Another factor could be that post-crisis lending patterns, such as smaller loan amounts, tighter credit, and relatively low interest rates, have together gradually increased the share of borrowers with lower monthly payments relative to incomes. In contrast, the share of severely cost-burdened households without a mortgage grew from 10.7  percent in 2008 to 12.5 percent in 2018. It is important to note that many of these homeowners have gained equity through the appreciation of home values, and that at least some may have other assets or retirement savings available. Yet for others, increases in other costs of owning one’s home may represent real financial hardship, possibly limiting the choice for cost-burdened homeowners to maintain ownership of their home. There was no statistically significant change in the share of moderately cost burdened households without mortgages.   The number of home purchases made with mortgage loans has remained relatively constant since 2010, but remains significantly lower than the 2005 peak Home purchase originations, or the number of new mortgages taken out by borrowers, have remained relatively constant following a large decline after the 2008 foreclosure crisis, but fell slightly in the last year. Like all other measures, there is geographic variation within these overall trends. The largest number of financed purchases in 2018 was in Queens, followed by Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx. The 2018 numbers resemble those from 2017 with little variation; the only notable change occurred in Manhattan, which saw 874 fewer home purchase loans originated in 2018 than 2017. The overall number of mortgage originations in 2018 was less than half of the mortgages originated in 2005.   When examining home purchase originations by the race of the home purchaser, we see that the white share of borrowers remained relatively constant pre- and post- financial crisis, (declining roughly three percentage points) however the share of Asian borrowers grew from 18 percent to 34 percent. Conversely, the share of Black borrowers was cut in half, dropping from 18 percent to 9 percent, while the share of Hispanic borrowers decline from 14 percent to 9 percent.   Mortgage refinancings increased slightly in 2018, with refinancing origination patterns varying by geography and race Across the city, the total number of refinance originations increased between 2017 and 2018. The only borough that did not have an increase in refinancing originations was Manhattan (down 9 percent). The largest increase was in Staten Island (up 26 percent) followed by Brooklyn (up 17 percent), Queens (up 19 percent), and the Bronx (up 4 percent). This small decrease in Manhattan may be partially attributed to refinancing activity that took place right after the foreclosure crisis. Manhattan borrowers made up a much larger share of total refinancings between the 2009-2013 period than in the 2014-2018 period.   When examining refinancing originations by the race of the borrower, we see that the number of refinancing originations increased between 2017 and 2018 for every racial group tracked by HMDA. Similar to past periods, white borrowers made up the largest share of the total number of refinancing originations. The overall share of originations by race has changed since 2004, when Black and Hispanic households made up 29.3 percent and 15.3 percent of total mortgage refinancings respectively. In 2018, these shares fell to 19.4 percent and 11.5 percent respectively. As compared to 2004, Black and Hispanic households make up a smaller share of the mortgage refinancing market, and therefore may be less able to take advantage of current interest rates.   The number of foreclosure filings on one- to four-unit buildings has fallen since 2013, and it appears that 2019 will end with a smaller number of filings than in 2018 After peaking in 2009 and again in 2013, the total number of foreclosure filings for one- to four-unit buildings and condominiums fell continuously between 2014 and 2018. While total filings began to decline in 2014, repeat filings started decreasing in 2016, and still made up more than half (57%) of all foreclosure filings on one- to four-unit buildings and condominiums in 2018. The number of initial filings in 2018 was less than half of the number of initial filings from the 2013 peak, but still higher than the era prior to the foreclosure crisis.  Based on the number of foreclosure filings on one- to four-unit buildings and condominiums to date (Quarter 1 through Quarter 3), it appears as though this decreasing trend will continue through 2019. Compared to the number of filings at this time last year, there were about 9 percent fewer filings (697) on one- to four-unit buildings and condominiums in 2019. This decrease is smaller than the 12 percent decrease between 2017 and 2018 (1,117 filings)  So far in 2019, the three sub-borough areas with the highest filing rates per 1,000 owner-occupied units were in eastern Brooklyn and southeast Queens: Brownsville (20.5%), Jamaica/Hollis (16.8%), and East New York/Starrett City (15.4%). The three sub-borough areas with the lowest filing rates were all in Manhattan: Washington Heights/ Inwood (0.1%), Lower East Side/Chinatown (0.5%), and Upper West Side (0.6%).   Conclusion This analysis underscores the stark differences in homeownership by race and by borough. Black and Hispanic households purchase homes at a much lower rate than white and Asian households, and fewer of those that do own can take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgage. Recovery from the 2008 foreclosure crisis continues, though mortgage lending volumes remain significantly below pre-foreclosure crisis levels. The aftermath of the crisis and recovery also produced divergent results among homeowners: there were fewer severely and moderately cost burdened households with mortgages in 2018 than in 2008, yet for those that owned their homes “free and clear,” the share who were severely cost burdened households increased over the same period, though there’s potential wide variation in the financial picture for those households.

Thanks to generous donors: $1 donated = $2. >>    The Retrofit Depot Our Work Our Work Carbon-Free Buildings Carbon-Free Buildings Deep Retrofit Tools and Resources Deep Retrofit Tools and Resources The Retrofit Depot The Retrofit Depot A deep energy retrofit is a whole-building analysis and construction process that achieves much larger energy cost savings—sometimes more than 50% reduction—than those of simpler energy retrofits and fundamentally enhances the building value. Deep energy retrofits create deep energy savings but not always at once—measures can be implemented over several years.  Learn more about our current multifamily, affordable housing net-zero carbon retrofit initiative, REALIZE with programs in California and Massachusetts. How Is It Different? Most retrofit approaches are considered “light” because they focus only on upgrading lighting equipment and adding new motors to the heating and cooling systems. This leaves out bigger savings stemming from deeper measures like new windows, which can reduce heating and cooling loads to the point where big-dollar equipment can be reduced in size and cost. Such interventions are typically not considered because of high up-front cost and perceived higher risk. Those implementing a deep energy retrofit consider all major capital needed in the building over the next several years and plan interventions to this business-as-usual scenario to create higher efficiencies and other benefits. Upgrades can occur all at once or be phased over several years, depending on your budget or financing mechanism. A deep energy retrofit can meet all business-as-usual objectives in addition to many other benefits—many more than a simple energy retrofit. Building the Case Owners, investors, and occupants build the case for deep energy retrofits differently, depending on their unique circumstances. Owner-occupants of larger properties usually have more resources to conduct a comprehensive building analysis and therefore a greater ability to derive benefits from efficiency investments compared to smaller property owners and occupants. How to Retrofit You’ve the built the case for a deep energy retrofit and now comes the time to capture the opportunity. You’ll have to think through financing for the analysis costs and capital improvements. You’ll also need to know the key action items to make your process truly a deep energy retrofit and decide when to implement the capital improvements per your financing mechanism or budget. Financing Deep Energy Retrofits Owners, investors, and occupants will naturally think of retrofit financing differently, depending on their unique circumstances. Enacting a Deep Energy Retrofit A deep energy retrofit requires a multi-disciplinary team with a “can-do” attitude where the disciplines can constructively collaborate with each other. Case Studies Case Study Deep Retrofit: Empire State Building , 2009 Learn More Deep Retrofit: Empire State Building , 2009 Report Deep Retrofit: Empire State Building , 2009 Learn More Deep Retrofit: Empire State Building , 2009 The Byron Rogers Federal Building, courtesy of the GSA Case Study Deep Retrofit: Byron Rogers Federal Building, Denver , 2009 Learn More Deep Retrofit: Byron Rogers Federal Building, Denver , 2009 Case Study Deep Retrofit: Cleveland Clinic , 2012 Learn  More Deep Retrofit: Cleveland Clinic , 2012 Case Study Deep Retrofit: Indianapolis City-County Building , 2012 Learn More Deep Retrofit: Indianapolis City-County Building , 2012 Case Study Deep Retrofit: A Retail Franchise in San Francisco , 2012 Learn More Deep Retrofit: A Retail Franchise in San Francisco , 2012 Building the Case Owners, investors, and occupants build the case for deep energy retrofits differently, depending on their unique circumstances. Owner-occupants of larger properties usually have more resources to conduct a comprehensive building analysis and therefore a greater ability to derive benefits from efficiency investments compared to smaller property owners and occupants.Likewise, occupants enjoy the direct benefits of a sustainable property, while the benefits to investors have been limited by traditional leases, holding periods, and an inability to easily have tenants pay for the benefits they receive. However, if you consider all the types of value that deep energy retrofits can deliver for each party, a deep energy retrofit can make sense for everyone. A key part of building the case for a deep energy retrofit is targeting a building and doing the analysis at the appropriate time and under the appropriate circumstances. Using deep energy retrofit triggers can significantly improve both the economics and convenience of energy improvements.In some cases, deep energy retrofits may add little to no cost to business-as-usual operations and capital requirements. In other cases, when the organization has a dearth of freely available capital, owners will need to secure financing. Taking the Next Step If you have decided not to conduct a deep energy retrofit, than we recommend low- and no-cost re-commissioning (or retro-commissioning) measures and a simple retrofit. If you have built a solid case for the deep energy retrofit of a building but it is not the right time to conduct the retrofit, then we recommend commissioning and planning for a deep energy retrofit when a trigger is expected to occur. We do not recommend a simple retrofit for a building that has been slated for a deep energy retrofit analysis within 5 to 10 years (because most simple retrofits take that long to pay back). Specifying Triggers A critical step in planning a deep energy retrofit is determining the ideal situations for performing a whole-building analysis. For example, if you already have a major end-of-life replacement planned for your building, you may be able to add in energy improvements or adjust the planned improvement to make the building more efficient and to build value for your organization at minimal added cost. Also, as part of your portfolio planning, if you desire one or more efficiency measures to be rolled out across a buildings portfolio, it may be best to select an archetypical building for a deep energy retrofit. Many situations and the opportunity ideal for a deep energy retrofit are as follows: Adaptive reuse of market repositioning: Redeveloping an existing building will require significant capital expense to which the cost of a deep retrofit would be incremental and likely small in comparison End- (or near end) of-life roof, window or siding replacement: Planned roof, window and siding replacements provide opportunities for significant improvements in daylighting and efficiency at small incremental cost, providing the leverage for a deep retrofit that reduces loads and therefore costs of replacing major equipment such as HVAC and lighting. End- (or near end) of-life HVAC, lighting or other major equipment replacement: Major equipment replacements provide opportunities to also address the envelope and other building systems as part of a deep retrofit. After reducing thermal and electrical loads, the marginal cost of replacing the major equipment with much smaller equipment (or no equipment at all) can be negative. Upgrades to meet code: Life safety upgrades may require substantial disruption and cost, enough that the incremental investment and effort to radically improve the building efficiency becomes not only feasible but also profitable. Fixing an “energy hog”: As part of an ongoing management plan for a group of buildings, the owner may desire a set of replicable efficiency measures. These measures can be developed from the deep energy retrofit of an archetypical building. Financing Deep Energy Retrofits Owners, investors, and occupants will naturally think of retrofit financing differently, depending on their unique circumstances. Below we list several retrofit financing mechanisms, both time-tested and emerging. The issues with energy efficiency financing are highly dynamic, with new policy and innovative business models constantly emerging. Financing Mechanisms Purchasing Loans: Allows for flexible spending, yet building owner’s debt capacity is reduced; significant down payment is required Bonds: Generally a public-sector organization issues a bond; approval time can be quite long but interest rate is low Loans: Allows for flexible spending, yet building owner’s debt capacity is reduced; significant down payment is required Bonds: Generally a public-sector organization issues a bond; approval time can be quite long but interest rate is low Lease Operating Lease: Building owner rents equipment; at end of lease the owner can renew/renogiate the lease, or purchase or return the equipment Capital Lease: Building owner rents equipment and ownership is almost always transferred at the end of the lease term; down payment (which can be zero) is always much less than a loan Operating Lease: Building owner rents equipment; at end of lease the owner can renew/renogiate the lease, or purchase or return the equipment Capital Lease: Building owner rents equipment and ownership is almost always transferred at the end of the lease term; down payment (which can be zero) is always much less than a loan Performance Contracting Financing arranged by an ESCO: Very little hassle for building owner since financing is fully managed and implemented by the ESCO Financing arranged by an ESCO: Very little hassle for building owner since financing is fully managed and implemented by the ESCO Emerging Mechanisms: PACE: Local government issues bond to pay for efficiency project; bond is repaid by building owner via property tax. Learn More On-bill Financing: Utility, state or 3rd party funds efficiency project and collects repayment via utility bill; repayment can be fixed to the property in the event of ownership transfer. Learn More Energy Services Agreement: Similar to a power purchase agreement, except for energy efficiency and not renewable energy; no upfront cost.

Learn More Enacting a Deep Energy Retrofit A deep energy retrofit requires a multi-disciplinary team with a “can-do” attitude where the disciplines can constructively collaborate with each other. The design professionals, in particular, should be experienced with integrative design (which is much more than holding one or two design meetings). A successful deep energy retrofit can produce a long-term strategy to phase out energy use in a building to make it super-efficient, more desirable to its occupants, and more valuable to the owner.We recommend downloading the Managing Deep Energy Retrofits Guide to specify the key action items required for a deep energy retrofit. We recommend the Identifying Design Opportunities Guide for a step-by-step approach to doing integrative design for a deep energy retrofit. Here are a few of the highlights to the deep energy retrofit process: Technical Potential Often owners or design teams target a somewhat arbitrary percentage of energy cost savings as part of the retrofit. Instead, imagine if you had no economic and other non-technical constraints whatsoever. Now estimate the lowest possible energy consumption. This is the “Technical Potential” for your building. Then, begin adding in constraints to achieving this potential, as shown in the diagram below, to arrive at the “Achievable Potential.” The process of adding in constraints will allow you to minimize them and to understand the reasons why you are not able to achieve the Technical Potential. Right Steps in the Right Order Many retrofit practitioners will begin design by thinking immediately about what mechanical and lighting equipment they need. We recommend this approach instead: Identify the specific end-user needs so you know the purpose of your design. Then, understand the existing building systems and how well they work. Next, consider passive features and load reduction before introducing new mechanical and electrical systems. Find synergies between systems and waste streams to create multiple benefits from single expenditures. Finally, optimize controls and realize the intended design. Modeling Energy and Lifecycle Costs Design teams can use energy modeling as a tool to inform design and to predict energy use. It enables analysis that is necessary for deep retrofits: passive design analysis (such as daylighting), energy reductions from bundles of measures, and reductions in cooling/heating loads. In addition, design teams can modify and calibrate the energy model to the post-retrofit building in order to support savings verification and on-going savings. In concert with energy modeling, design teams can employ a life cycle cost model to calculate life cycle cost. Life cycle cost analyses should include (but often do not) examining bundles of efficiency measures in relation to a business-as-usual scenario and estimating capital cost savings from equipment downsizing.

That’s according to an analysis from the Urban Institute released Wednesday. Wealth inequality grew between 1963 and 2013, according to Urban’s analysis of three different consumer finance surveys. Yes, average wealth has increased over the past 50 years, but not at the same rate for everyone. The bottom 10th percentile has fared the worst: actually, its average wealth declined . But the middle of the wealth distribution — those with about $40,000 in assets in 1963 — has seen its wealth double. The top 90th percentile has seen its wealth quadruple, and the really rich — the top 99th percentile — has seen its wealth increase sixfold. So while the mid-wealth families saw their wealth increase by the highest percentage, the families near the top of the wealth distribution obviously had a lot more to start with. They’re now more better off than middle-wealth families than they were in 1963. In other words, wealth inequality is greater. You may have read David Leonhardt’s Upshot article in the New York Times Tuesday explaining that “Inequality has actually not risen since the financial crisis.” Leonhardt highlights the research of George Washington University’s Stephen Rose, who’s shown that while income inequality is high by historical standards, it is not higher than it was before the financial crisis began — because of two factors: one, the rich suffered a big hit from the crisis, and two, government transfers have helped maintain the status quo for middle and lower-income Americans. Income inequality is not the same as wealth inequality; although, as the Urban Institute points out, the former is an important contributor to the latter. Income is what you make; wealth is what families fall back on when the going gets tough. According to Urban’s calculations (using Current Population Survey data), average income for all three wealth distributions declined starting in 2006. While average incomes among the top 90th percentile took a hit during the financial crisis, they still far exceeded incomes in the bottom 10th percentile and 50th percentile, and the gap in 2013 outstretched the gap in 1963. Now let’s talk about race. In 2013, the average wealth (remember, that could include the value of a home) of African-American families was $95,000. For Hispanics — $112,000. The average wealth of white families was $500,000 greater than it was for African-American or Hispanic families. In 1963, average white family wealth exceeded that of African-American and Hispanic families by only $117,000 (in 2013 dollars). As the Urban Institute points out, the wealth gap between races increases with age. That makes sense if you consider that most of us make more as we get older and advance in our careers. But if white Americans start out making more at better paying jobs than blacks and Hispanics, they’re going to end up with a lot more when they near retirement age. But it’s not just income gaps that explain the racial wealth gap. African Americans and Hispanics own homes at lower rates than whites do — even when income-level is controlled. That explains a lot about lack of accumulated wealth. And again, even at the same income levels, Hispanics and African Americans have less in liquid retirement savings than whites do. Another reason why African-Americans have less wealth than whites is student loan debt. Since the mid-2000s, they’ve had more of it. The fact that 42 percent of African-American Americans between the ages of 25 and 55 had student loan debt in 2013 (compared to 28 percent of whites) reflects a vicious cycle: families’ lower wealth compels students to take on debt, but that debt then hurts their overall wealth well into adulthood. The New York Fed reported Tuesday that delinquency rates on student loans have actually increased, defying the overall trend of delinquency rates falling for other types of loans. “Student loan delinquencies and repayment problems appear to be reducing borrowers’ ability to form their own households,” said Donghoon Lee, research officer at the New York Fed. While Professor Rose’s research about income inequality not actually having grown since the crisis tells an important tale about government transfers — namely that they work — the Urban Institute analysis suggests that government efforts to promote asset-building by low-income families do not. According to the Urban Institute, many subsidies disproportionately benefit the middle or upper classes, while some of it what it calls “safety-net programs” may even discourage the poor from saving if, for example, having assets disqualifies them from receiving benefits.

That’s according to an analysis from the Urban Institute released Wednesday. Wealth inequality grew between 1963 and 2013, according to Urban’s analysis of three different consumer finance surveys. Yes, average wealth has increased over the past 50 years, but not at the same rate for everyone. The bottom 10th percentile has fared the worst: actually, its average wealth declined . But the middle of the wealth distribution — those with about $40,000 in assets in 1963 — has seen its wealth double. The top 90th percentile has seen its wealth quadruple, and the really rich — the top 99th percentile — has seen its wealth increase sixfold. So while the mid-wealth families saw their wealth increase by the highest percentage, the families near the top of the wealth distribution obviously had a lot more to start with. They’re now more better off than middle-wealth families than they were in 1963. In other words, wealth inequality is greater. You may have read David Leonhardt’s Upshot article in the New York Times Tuesday explaining that “Inequality has actually not risen since the financial crisis.” Leonhardt highlights the research of George Washington University’s Stephen Rose, who’s shown that while income inequality is high by historical standards, it is not higher than it was before the financial crisis began — because of two factors: one, the rich suffered a big hit from the crisis, and two, government transfers have helped maintain the status quo for middle and lower-income Americans. Income inequality is not the same as wealth inequality; although, as the Urban Institute points out, the former is an important contributor to the latter.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Contracting agencies would be required to reimburse indirect costs incurred by covered city service contractors in accordance with the required methodology. Int 0244-2024 This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to distribute information about New York state non-driver identification cards to every student grades 9 through 12 at the start of each school year.

DOHMH would also be required to coordinate with agencies and community organizations to ensure that communities most at risk of contracting the virus and communities with low vaccine accessibility have adequate vaccine access. DOHMH would evaluate the demographics of monkeypox vaccine recipients, and adjust the hours of operation and location of vaccination sites based on such examination and the needs of communities most at risk of contracting the disease. The bill would also require DOHMH to maintain a vaccine portal that allows individuals to schedule appointments for COVID-19, monkeypox and other infectious disease vaccinations. Int 0248-2024 This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to visit a unit to observe a condition alleged in a housing complaint. If HPD is not able to enter the premises to observe the alleged condition, HPD would be required to post a notice on the door of the unit and to visit the unit again on a different day to attempt entry. If HPD cannot enter the unit after the second attempt, HPD would be required to call and send a text message to the tenant to schedule an appointment to visit the unit. If HPD is unable to reach the tenant by phone or text message, HPD would be required to categorize the housing complaint as “unresolved.” HPD would only be permitted to categorize a housing complaint as “closed” when HPD verifies that a condition has been fixed, a condition does not exist or the housing complaint has otherwise been resolved.

Applicants may file a complaint with HPD or the New York City Housing Development Corporation, as applicable, if they believe their application was rejected in error. HPD rules must also provide guidance to developers regarding information it may consider in selecting applicants, specifically prohibiting developers from considering photographs of an applicant’s current living situation or minor children’s report cards, prohibiting developers from rejecting applicants based solely on credit score, and requiring developers consider all sources of an applicant’s income.

Int 0888-2024 This bill would require that when a purchaser submits an offer to buy a property that the owner has not listed for sale, is not actively selling, did not intend to sell, or where such owner was unaware of their ownership of the property, the purchaser must disclose, in writing, in a clear and conspicuous manner, the estimated market value of the residential property. The purchaser must also disclose the market value of substantially similar properties that are currently listed for sale in a publicly searchable database as designated by rules of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Any purchaser who violates this law is liable for a civil penalty of at least $250 for the first violation and at least $500 for a subsequent violation. Each distinct offer that violates this law is considered a separate violation and each day that a violating offer is submitted to the owner is a separate violation that goes toward calculating the total penalty. Int 0889-2024 This bill would require that the system maintained by Department of Finance to provide notification to interested parties of the recording of certain real estate instruments also provide notification to the local council member when a deed-related or mortgage-related document is recorded that affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for at least 30 years, unless the council member opts out of receiving notifications.

Int 1053-2024 This bill would require the Department for the Aging (DFTA) to conduct a feasibility study regarding the creation of older adult information and service centers. Older adult information and service centers would serve as physical locations where older adults can sign-up for city based services and receive information concerning DFTA programming. In the feasibility study, DFTA would be required to identify at least five potential locations in each borough for the creation of older adult information and service centers. The feasibility study will also identify considerations for locating proposed sites and potential services that can be provided at centers. Additionally, the feasibility study would require DFTA to assess the potential benefits of establishing older adult information and service centers and potential constraints.

This bill would also require reporting on attendance of such training. Int 1092-2024 This bill would require that the department for the aging develop printed and digital informational materials to educate older adults about internet scams, phone scams, and phishing scams and provide quarterly guidance to older adult centers about emerging scams. It would require that the department post a digital version of the informational materials on its website, and would require the commissioner to ensure that such informational materials are distributed to homebound older adults and that older adult centers distribute such informational materials to older adults in their facilities.

The purchaser must also disclose the market value of substantially similar properties that are currently listed for sale in a publicly searchable database as designated by rules of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Any purchaser who violates this law is liable for a civil penalty of at least $250 for the first violation and at least $500 for a subsequent violation. Each distinct offer that violates this law is considered a separate violation and each day that a violating offer is submitted to the owner is a separate violation that goes toward calculating the total penalty.
