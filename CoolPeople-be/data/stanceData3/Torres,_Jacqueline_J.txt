Service, Duty, and Community First “I served my country, now I’m serving my community.” Public service is about people, not politics. As a veteran and community member, I bring a mission-first mindset to every issue, grounded in discipline, integrity, and a deep love for our neighborhoods. I believe in leading with action, not partisanship. “I served my country, now I’m serving my community.” Public service is about people, not politics.

We can back our officers while also holding them to high standards, just like in the military. I will work to build bridges between law enforcement and the people they serve, ensuring fairness, respect, and safety for all. “Safe streets and community trust go hand-in-hand.” Real security means both safety and justice.
