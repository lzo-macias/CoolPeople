Journalists Meteorologist Actress Actor Pastors Attorneys Reality Tv Personality Curtis Sliwa Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Height, Net Worth, Salary 01/19/2024 Janeffer Politicians 0 Curtis Sliwa Biography Curtis Sliwa is an American activist, founder, and CEO of the Guardian Angels, as well as a radio talk show host and politician . He is the Republican nominee for the 2021 New York City mayoral election. Sliwa is the founder and chief executive officer of the Guardian Angels, a non-profit organization dedicated to unarmed crime prevention. Despite founding the Guardian Angels, he was nite manager of the McDonald’s restaurant on Fordham Road in the Bronx. Curtis attended Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit high school from which he was expelled, and Canarsie High School, a public high school in Brooklyn, New York City. Brown University granted Sliwa a half scholarship to study political science. In his youth, Curtis worked as a delivery boy for the New York Daily News, earning the title of “Newsboy of the Year” and a trip to the White House after saving several people from a burning building while on his route. Curtis Sliwa Guardian Angels In May 1977, Curtis created the Magnificent 13, a group dedicated to combating violence and crime on the New York City Subway as the city was experiencing a crime wave. The group grew and, in 1979, it was renamed the Guardian Angels. The group’s actions brought strong reactions, both positive and negative. Membership of the Guardian Angels showed that 80% of them were either black or of Hispanic ethnicity. Moreover, unarmed, the group required training in karate and fulfillment of legal requirements for citizen arrest for all members before they were to be deployed. Mayor Ed Koch, a critic of Sliwa and of the organization, launched an investigation into the Guardian Angels, which, according to The Washington Post, proved so positive that the Guardian Angels will soon be awarded some sort of official status. Then Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo, who was a rare early advocate of the organization, is quoted as saying that they are a better expression of morality than our city deserves. … In addition, in 1992, Curtis admitted that the head of the Guardian Angels faked heroic subway rescues for fame. He also agreed to claim falsely that three off-duty transit police officers had kidnaped him. In the early 1980s, Curtis expanded his operations to Buffalo, and he was a vocal opponent of local police policies and tactics. An incident involving Guardian Angel member Frank Melvin, who was fatally shot by a Newark police officer after mistaking the unzipping of his jacket to expose his Guardian Angels badge for a threat, occurred in December 1981. Sliwa stated that the racially motivated shooting of Melvin, an African American, was carried out by a white officer who was shielded by the police department, rather than the Hispanic officer named as the shooter. Both cops were absolved of charges in Melvin’s death by an Essex County grand jury. Curtis Sliwa Murder Attempt On June 19, 1992, Curtis was kidnaped and shot by two gunmen after entering a stolen taxi in Manhattan. The taxi picked up Sliwa near his home in the East Village, and a gunman hiding in the front passenger seat jumped up and fired several gunshots, hitting him in the groin and legs. The kidnapping was foiled when Sliwa leaped from the front window of the moving cab and escaped. He underwent surgery for internal injuries and leg wounds. Federal authorities charged John A. Gotti, the son of Gamboni family chief John Gotti, with attempted murder and a slew of additional crimes. Prosecutors alleged Gotti was enraged over comments Curtis made about Gotti’s father on his radio show. However, three successive jurors were unable to agree to convict Gotti on any of the accusations against him, and the charges were dismissed after three attempts to try him, the most recent on September 20, 2005. Jurors, later on, told a reporter they did believe he had a duty in Sliwa’s shooting. However, prosecutors denied re-trying Gotti and dismissed the charges again. Sliwa claimed that he would seek damages in civil court. Moreover, Michael Yannotti, a Gotti associate, was also charged with shooting Sliwa in the incident but was acquitted. However, Yannotti was sentenced to 20 years on an unrelated racketeering charge. Still, Manhattan Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said evidence suggested Yannotti was the shooter. Curtis Sliwa Media Career Curtis has been a radio broadcaster for a period of three decades, starting on WABC-AM, where he kicked off his career in 1990. In 1994, Silwa was hired by the city-owned and operated WNYC. However, some people, including Curtis, suggested that he was given access to the station by the newly elected Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whom he had supported in the 1993 mayoral race. Moreover, he became a famous conservative radio talk show host. Since 1996, Silwa has hosted a lot of radio programs on WABC. In 200, he became the co-host, with attorney Ron Ruby, of the long-running Curtis and Kuby show in the morning. The show lasted for a period of eight years before Citadel Broadcasting replaced the team with Don Imus. In addition, his partner, Ron Ruby, was a lawyer, with whom he had multiple times hosted the Curtis and Ruby weekday radio show at noon on WABC-AM in New York City. From June 2017, Silwa’s co-host was attorney and television commentator Eboni Williams. Recently, his co-host was Juliet Huddy, who joined the show in February 2019. On December 1, 2018, the Curtis Sliwa Live program’s national syndication kicked off. WABC retained him until November of 2009 when his show was pulled down after a contract dispute. Curtis then joined WNYM-AM 970, where he hosted both the morning and evening drive-time shows. However, on January 2, 2014, Sliwa made his way back to WAC, replacing Rus LimLimbaugh,o moved to WOR-AM. Prior to his mayoral campaign, a Bronx lawyer lodged a complaint claiming that Curtis was promoting his mayoral candidacy on his show, which would violate campaign laws. After Sliwa officially declared his candidacy in March of 2021, his radio program went on a break. Curtis Sliwa’s Politics In September 2016, Curtis launched a successful hostile takeover of the Reform Party of New York State. The party lost access to the ballot box in the November 2018 elections. In December of 2019, Silwa declared in an interview that he hated the Republican President of the United States, Donald Trump, calling him a screwball and a crackpot. After Trump left office in February 2021, Curtis left the Reform Party for the Republican Party. Moreover, on March 8, 2020, Sliwa made clear that he would be running for mayor of New York City in 2021 as a Republican, seeking to become the 110th mayor of New York City. John Catsimatidis, a billionaire who had earlier mulled a mayoral run, endorsed Sliwa, who had become an employee of his after his 2020 purchase of WABC from Cumulus Media. After they became friends, the primary race turned Sliwa and Fernando Mateo into bitter rivals. The Manhattan, Queens, and Bronx Republican parties endorsed Mateo, while the Staten Island and Brooklyn Republicans endorsed Sliwa. However, Sliwa criticized Mateo for donating to the 2017 re-election campaign of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and also accused him of breaking the law. … Furthermore, during the campaign period, Mateo and Curtis clashed over loyalty to former President Donald Trump. Mateo believes that Trump won the 2020 presidential election, while Sliwa did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020. The unofficial results showed that Sliwa won by 72%. Curtis has run on a platform opposing the defunding of the police movement, supporting a property tax overhaul so that working-class residents would not pay higher taxes than wealthy citizens, keeping in place the specialized high school admissions test while increasing opportunities for vocational training in charter schools and focusing on fiscal restraint. Moreover, Sliwa opposes the killing of unwanted animals by making all animal shelters no-kill shelters. Curtis Sliwa’s Photo Curtis Sliwa Age How old is Curtis Sliwa?

The volunteer vigilante squad, led by Curtis Sliwa, was a mainstay in the city in the late 1970s and ’80s—a period when the police department coined the moniker “ Fear City ” for the five boroughs and warned tourists not to go out after sunset. The charismatic and controversial Sliwa trained his red-capped followers—mostly young people of color from troubled neighborhoods—to patrol the streets and subways. At the time, crime was high: The rates of murder, theft, and assault all roughly doubled between 1965 and 1975 . And by the mid-1970s, the police force was thinned out because of a fiscal crisis facing the city. The troupe’s stated aim was to protect citizens and deter wrongdoing, and they’d physically fight individuals they deemed a threat. But the Guardian Angels, and Sliwa himself, were not without critics, who said the members were inadequately trained , ineffective, and behaved no better than local gangs did. The most prominent critic was former Mayor Ed Koch, who accused Sliwa of being more interested in fame than stopping criminals. That accusation was partially corroborated in 1992 when Sliwa, whose group by then had expanded internationally, admitted to faking multiple crimes for publicity—a decision he’s since said he regrets. New York City is a wholly different town today: Crime rates are at historic lows and a crisis of gentrification has largely replaced that of urban blight. But to Sliwa, the Guardian Angels are still relevant, even if their ranks in New York are a shadow of what they once were. Last year, he found a reason to call his followers back to service: a series of subway slashings that then-NYPD Commissioner William Bratton called an “ aberration .” “There’s an aggressiveness that’s taking place in the subways that hasn’t taken place for quite some time,” Sliwa told Time . “My sense over the years is that we’re beginning to slip back.” In hyping those events, Sliwa seems to be aiming for a Guardian Angels resurgence. His current focus is the subway system, which he claims is a dangerous place for women specifically. I spoke with Sliwa recently about his motivations; his legacy; and a new documentary, Vigilante , that chronicles his career, mostly through his own perspective. The conversation that follows, held over two phone calls, has been edited and condensed for clarity. Maura Ewing: First, the red beret: You are wearing it in every scene. Is that your everyday attire? Curtis Sliwa : It’s like an appendage to my head. People think that I sleep with it. Ewing: Do you? Sliwa : Sometimes I do. I actually pull it over my head and it blocks out the light and I catch a few zzz’s. You can do everything with that red beret. Ewing: What’s the current status of the Guardian Angels? Are you patrolling? Sliwa : We’re in 13 countries, 130 cities. We have an international membership of about 5,000. The main focus is always going to be the patrol. We also have ancillary things that we do now—for instance, we have Junior Guardian Angels. These are young girls, young boys, who are six to 15 years old. They do not patrol—we teach them martial arts. This way they can protect themselves, it teaches them discipline, and it gives them self-esteem. They also do community service. Most recently I’ve spent a lot of time on two new groups. One is called the Perv Busters . It’s mostly women who patrol. The program has had just a year in existence in New York City; now we’re going to try to roll it out in some of our other chapters. They go after the [men] exposing themselves on the subways—very similar to what we’ve seen a lot of well-to-do guys be accused of and acknowledge, like the comedian Louis C.K. [These men] collect in mass transit because it’s easy for them to rub up against women and violate women, particularly during rush hour. Often, we are provided pictures of them that victims took with their cellphones. We’ll do informational outreach in which we print up thousands of flyers and spread them throughout the system and then immediately begin pursuing them—something the local authorities just don’t do. It’s almost like out of sight, out of mind. Ewing: With Perv Busters, are you trying to catch people in the act? Sliwa: We have, but it’s not the main focus. The predators underground in the subways are creatures of habit. They will ride the same trains at the same times, normally at peak hours, because if a woman objects to him [touching] her or accosting her, he can claim, “Oh, it’s so crowded here, I’m sorry.” We get their photographs, and we begin to hunt them. We have had some arrested, but it’s mostly an informational campaign. Ewing: Do you ever worry that you’re going after an innocent person? Sliwa: Of course. The checks and balances are that you don’t act like Donald Trump and retweet something. You do due-diligence forensic research [to see] if you can come up with a name, an identity, other people who will likewise indicate that this person has been molesting women in the area. We’ve been doing this for over a year-and-a-half. We’ve probably leafletted 185 [men]. None of it has come back to haunt us because we didn’t dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Ewing: How do you do your research? Sliwa: We try to go online, see if there are other women who likewise have seen this guy, or if he fits a description. A lot of times women will take pictures of these guys—you make sure it’s not Photoshopped. If enough women have come forward and have IDed the guy and he seems to have a certain pattern, then we go with it without police verification. Ewing: What is enough? Sliwa: Enough is three or more people who have IDed the guy who aren’t friends with each other and not related—independent sources. Ewing : Is Perv Busters legal? Sliwa: It’s legal. But if you ID the wrong person, you yourself can be arrested because, remember, we have no special powers or privileges. Ewing: Your group started patrolling the subways again in New York City about a year ago—is that right? Sliwa: No, we have patrolled regularly since 1979. We’ve had patrols every day and every night since we began. But nowhere near to the effect that we had between 1979 and 1993, which is the period that the documentary covers. Ewing: I read in a Time story that you came back last year because of a series of slashings on the subway. Sliwa: That’s true. We doubled down, we increased our recruitment, and we began to focus on those neighborhoods that were the feeding system for the slashings. They weren’t taking place all over the subway system, but were in certain key junction areas, particularly up to Harlem, Washington Heights, Inwood, the South Bronx, and parts of Brooklyn. The NYPD didn’t seem to have an answer to it at the time, so we helped to fill the void. [The NYPD did not reply to a request for comment on this story, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority declined to comment on Sliwa’s campaign in the subways.] People will get in contact with us if they haven’t gotten relief from first going to the police. We’re always the last choice that a person has when they’re frustrated because they’ve tried all other measures, and they figure they’ve got nothing to lose. The Perv Busters is a classic example: Every time we’re on the subway, we have women coming up, showing us pictures on their cellphones. We always ask, “Did you take it to the police?” They say, “Yeah.” “What happened?” “Nothing.” Obviously, we were more needed in the ’70s when they were laying off cops because the city was in fiscal distress. [In 1974] the city announced that at night there would be no more uniformed police patrolling [in the subway] during the off-peak hours, 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. That was a license to steal for thugs. You don’t have that situation now. The police are fully staffed and they generally do a pretty good job. But there are still those pockets out there, situations that they chose not to get involved in. Or they’ve tried some methods and are just not successful. Or they don’t seem to understand the problem. Ewing: It seems like you have an interest in convincing the public that crime is coming back. Is that an element of your approach? Sliwa : No, I wouldn’t say it is. Ewing : But in New York, your group reemerged after the slashings. I read that you were convinced the city’s slipping back. Is it part of your approach to tell people the city is getting more dangerous? Sliwa: Definitely in the subways, the number of [reported] sexual assaults and sexual harassments has gone up each of the past two years by 20 percent. It’s a major problem in the subway system, along with crime in general in the subway, whereas you can’t really make the same case aboveground. But, still, it’s a much better system than what we were introduced into when anarchy reigned between 1979 and 1992 in the subways. Ewing : The new documentary alleges that you contributed to the decline of crime in the ’90s. How? Sliwa: There were three ways that we contributed: First, we destroyed the stereotype that existed in our city that young black and Latino men or women coming out of the hood had a predisposition to join gangs and be thugs or thugettes. That was a very prevalent stereotype. But here emerges the Guardian Angels, predominately black or Hispanic young people who were a total contrast to the gangs. Secondly, we had a fight-back mentality. The acronym very common then was MYOB: Mind your own business. You had a lot of lawyers out there threatening to sue people, like us, who got physically involved. We spit in their eye and defied that. The last thing was that we proved that one woman or one man could make a difference in a neighborhood. All it took was one person to start organizing; he or she could make a difference. You just had to do the heavy lifting and the hard work and know that change would come in slow increments. Ewing: Some counter theories to why crime declined are that there was economic growth in the ’90s and more people were incarcerated—what do you think about that? Sliwa: Birthrate, that’s another factor. I personally believe a lot of it had to do with an enormous drop in the youth population. All of those factors played in, too. Ewing : Initially, how did you get community members to trust the Guardian Angels? Sliwa: They were coming from poor and impoverished neighborhoods; they were fed up; they wanted to fight back but needed a vehicle and mechanism to do that. It’s very hard to do that on your own.

The charismatic and controversial Sliwa trained his red-capped followers—mostly young people of color from troubled neighborhoods—to patrol the streets and subways. At the time, crime was high: The rates of murder, theft, and assault all roughly doubled between 1965 and 1975 . And by the mid-1970s, the police force was thinned out because of a fiscal crisis facing the city. The troupe’s stated aim was to protect citizens and deter wrongdoing, and they’d physically fight individuals they deemed a threat. But the Guardian Angels, and Sliwa himself, were not without critics, who said the members were inadequately trained , ineffective, and behaved no better than local gangs did. The most prominent critic was former Mayor Ed Koch, who accused Sliwa of being more interested in fame than stopping criminals. That accusation was partially corroborated in 1992 when Sliwa, whose group by then had expanded internationally, admitted to faking multiple crimes for publicity—a decision he’s since said he regrets. New York City is a wholly different town today: Crime rates are at historic lows and a crisis of gentrification has largely replaced that of urban blight. But to Sliwa, the Guardian Angels are still relevant, even if their ranks in New York are a shadow of what they once were. Last year, he found a reason to call his followers back to service: a series of subway slashings that then-NYPD Commissioner William Bratton called an “ aberration .” “There’s an aggressiveness that’s taking place in the subways that hasn’t taken place for quite some time,” Sliwa told Time . “My sense over the years is that we’re beginning to slip back.” In hyping those events, Sliwa seems to be aiming for a Guardian Angels resurgence. His current focus is the subway system, which he claims is a dangerous place for women specifically. I spoke with Sliwa recently about his motivations; his legacy; and a new documentary, Vigilante , that chronicles his career, mostly through his own perspective. The conversation that follows, held over two phone calls, has been edited and condensed for clarity. Maura Ewing: First, the red beret: You are wearing it in every scene. Is that your everyday attire? Curtis Sliwa : It’s like an appendage to my head. People think that I sleep with it. Ewing: Do you? Sliwa : Sometimes I do. I actually pull it over my head and it blocks out the light and I catch a few zzz’s. You can do everything with that red beret. Ewing: What’s the current status of the Guardian Angels? Are you patrolling? Sliwa : We’re in 13 countries, 130 cities. We have an international membership of about 5,000. The main focus is always going to be the patrol. We also have ancillary things that we do now—for instance, we have Junior Guardian Angels. These are young girls, young boys, who are six to 15 years old. They do not patrol—we teach them martial arts. This way they can protect themselves, it teaches them discipline, and it gives them self-esteem. They also do community service. Most recently I’ve spent a lot of time on two new groups. One is called the Perv Busters . It’s mostly women who patrol. The program has had just a year in existence in New York City; now we’re going to try to roll it out in some of our other chapters. They go after the [men] exposing themselves on the subways—very similar to what we’ve seen a lot of well-to-do guys be accused of and acknowledge, like the comedian Louis C.K. [These men] collect in mass transit because it’s easy for them to rub up against women and violate women, particularly during rush hour. Often, we are provided pictures of them that victims took with their cellphones. We’ll do informational outreach in which we print up thousands of flyers and spread them throughout the system and then immediately begin pursuing them—something the local authorities just don’t do. It’s almost like out of sight, out of mind. Ewing: With Perv Busters, are you trying to catch people in the act? Sliwa: We have, but it’s not the main focus. The predators underground in the subways are creatures of habit. They will ride the same trains at the same times, normally at peak hours, because if a woman objects to him [touching] her or accosting her, he can claim, “Oh, it’s so crowded here, I’m sorry.” We get their photographs, and we begin to hunt them. We have had some arrested, but it’s mostly an informational campaign. Ewing: Do you ever worry that you’re going after an innocent person? Sliwa: Of course. The checks and balances are that you don’t act like Donald Trump and retweet something. You do due-diligence forensic research [to see] if you can come up with a name, an identity, other people who will likewise indicate that this person has been molesting women in the area. We’ve been doing this for over a year-and-a-half. We’ve probably leafletted 185 [men]. None of it has come back to haunt us because we didn’t dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Ewing: How do you do your research? Sliwa: We try to go online, see if there are other women who likewise have seen this guy, or if he fits a description. A lot of times women will take pictures of these guys—you make sure it’s not Photoshopped. If enough women have come forward and have IDed the guy and he seems to have a certain pattern, then we go with it without police verification. Ewing: What is enough? Sliwa: Enough is three or more people who have IDed the guy who aren’t friends with each other and not related—independent sources. Ewing : Is Perv Busters legal? Sliwa: It’s legal. But if you ID the wrong person, you yourself can be arrested because, remember, we have no special powers or privileges. Ewing: Your group started patrolling the subways again in New York City about a year ago—is that right? Sliwa: No, we have patrolled regularly since 1979. We’ve had patrols every day and every night since we began. But nowhere near to the effect that we had between 1979 and 1993, which is the period that the documentary covers. Ewing: I read in a Time story that you came back last year because of a series of slashings on the subway. Sliwa: That’s true. We doubled down, we increased our recruitment, and we began to focus on those neighborhoods that were the feeding system for the slashings. They weren’t taking place all over the subway system, but were in certain key junction areas, particularly up to Harlem, Washington Heights, Inwood, the South Bronx, and parts of Brooklyn. The NYPD didn’t seem to have an answer to it at the time, so we helped to fill the void. [The NYPD did not reply to a request for comment on this story, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority declined to comment on Sliwa’s campaign in the subways.] People will get in contact with us if they haven’t gotten relief from first going to the police. We’re always the last choice that a person has when they’re frustrated because they’ve tried all other measures, and they figure they’ve got nothing to lose. The Perv Busters is a classic example: Every time we’re on the subway, we have women coming up, showing us pictures on their cellphones. We always ask, “Did you take it to the police?” They say, “Yeah.” “What happened?” “Nothing.” Obviously, we were more needed in the ’70s when they were laying off cops because the city was in fiscal distress. [In 1974] the city announced that at night there would be no more uniformed police patrolling [in the subway] during the off-peak hours, 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. That was a license to steal for thugs. You don’t have that situation now. The police are fully staffed and they generally do a pretty good job. But there are still those pockets out there, situations that they chose not to get involved in. Or they’ve tried some methods and are just not successful. Or they don’t seem to understand the problem. Ewing: It seems like you have an interest in convincing the public that crime is coming back. Is that an element of your approach? Sliwa : No, I wouldn’t say it is. Ewing : But in New York, your group reemerged after the slashings. I read that you were convinced the city’s slipping back. Is it part of your approach to tell people the city is getting more dangerous? Sliwa: Definitely in the subways, the number of [reported] sexual assaults and sexual harassments has gone up each of the past two years by 20 percent. It’s a major problem in the subway system, along with crime in general in the subway, whereas you can’t really make the same case aboveground. But, still, it’s a much better system than what we were introduced into when anarchy reigned between 1979 and 1992 in the subways. Ewing : The new documentary alleges that you contributed to the decline of crime in the ’90s. How? Sliwa: There were three ways that we contributed: First, we destroyed the stereotype that existed in our city that young black and Latino men or women coming out of the hood had a predisposition to join gangs and be thugs or thugettes. That was a very prevalent stereotype. But here emerges the Guardian Angels, predominately black or Hispanic young people who were a total contrast to the gangs. Secondly, we had a fight-back mentality. The acronym very common then was MYOB: Mind your own business. You had a lot of lawyers out there threatening to sue people, like us, who got physically involved. We spit in their eye and defied that. The last thing was that we proved that one woman or one man could make a difference in a neighborhood. All it took was one person to start organizing; he or she could make a difference. You just had to do the heavy lifting and the hard work and know that change would come in slow increments. Ewing: Some counter theories to why crime declined are that there was economic growth in the ’90s and more people were incarcerated—what do you think about that? Sliwa: Birthrate, that’s another factor. I personally believe a lot of it had to do with an enormous drop in the youth population. All of those factors played in, too. Ewing : Initially, how did you get community members to trust the Guardian Angels? Sliwa: They were coming from poor and impoverished neighborhoods; they were fed up; they wanted to fight back but needed a vehicle and mechanism to do that. It’s very hard to do that on your own.
