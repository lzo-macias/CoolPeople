Before Governor’s announcement in January, the process starts when the previous budget passed the Albany legislature supposedly by March 31.  The fiscal year is April 1 until March 31.  All approved appropriations must be disbursed by December 31 . Thus preparation of the FY 2024 budget started in April 2022; announced by Governor in January 2023; passed by legislature in April 2023 for the April 2023-March 2024 year; and expired by December 2024. Governor Kathy Hochul proposed a $229 billion state budget for FY 2024 . The massive spending proposal for New York — which had an estimated population of just under 20 million last year — represents more than double the $116 billion budget of Florida, which had an estimated 22 million residents in 2024.

Jan 26, 2025 Governor Hochul’s FY 2026 $252 Billion budget Jan 21, 2025 Marijuana and Crime Jan 6, 2025 3 thoughts on “Proposal 1:  For car owners!” Danniel's reply to Howard says: October 13, 2022 at 9:26 am Thanks Howard for your comment. When politicians introduce something, it has to make sense in the idea AND execution. If the objective is to reduce cars, the objective most likely will be met.  In its execution, you already know residents and businesses are asking for exemptions and reductions.  They will get it. With fewer cars, more expensive tourist tickets, food delivery…  costs of living and working in Manhattan WILL GO UP. Airport taxi fare was $35 flat fee to Manhattan, $100 per trip is conceivable.  Even traveling within Manhattan below 60 Street, $25 to $50 is not out of question.  If people don’t want to pay that fare, taxis will be out of business. Here is the kicker.  The other objective is to get $1 billion revenue to MTA.  Do you think that will happen when deals are being made?  Cost of installation and maintenance will eat up most of that revenue right away.  It will never happen when car and truck counts are cut. That’s why it’s a bad idea.  Look at London. If it affects your pocketbook and business for same or less quality of service, why pay more?

When politicians introduce something, it has to make sense in the idea AND execution. If the objective is to reduce cars, the objective most likely will be met.  In its execution, you already know residents and businesses are asking for exemptions and reductions.  They will get it. With fewer cars, more expensive tourist tickets, food delivery…  costs of living and working in Manhattan WILL GO UP. Airport taxi fare was $35 flat fee to Manhattan, $100 per trip is conceivable.  Even traveling within Manhattan below 60 Street, $25 to $50 is not out of question.  If people don’t want to pay that fare, taxis will be out of business. Here is the kicker.  The other objective is to get $1 billion revenue to MTA.  Do you think that will happen when deals are being made?  Cost of installation and maintenance will eat up most of that revenue right away.  It will never happen when car and truck counts are cut. That’s why it’s a bad idea.  Look at London. If it affects your pocketbook and business for same or less quality of service, why pay more?  It’s like rent and real estate tax.  Rent at least goes down sometimes, but not taxes.

Maps Danniel Maio Issues Queens Chronicle article on the State Senate race By Danniel By Oct 20, 2024 I did respond to Stephanie Meditz’s request, but it was after this article was published .  The following is what I wrote back to her. Hi Stephanie, Please accept my apology for the delay responding to your request.  In addition to being the State Senator Candidate on the ballot against Joseph Addabbo, I am also the president of Central Queens Republican Club.  We are having a meeting tonight.  Topic:  Judicial Candidates and Roundtable of Party Chairs. Central Queens Republican Club – Judicial Candidates and Roundtable of Party Chairs My main concern has always been the needs of our citizens.  Yes, I want to win, but when the system is stacked against non-incumbents, a big part of me has to acknowledge the difficulty of the fight. This is my experience.  I lost against Addabbo in 2022, but I got 43% of the votes.  I was on four lines:  Republican, Conservative, Independence and Medical Freedom.  Addabbo, two: Democrat and We The People.  This year, Addabbo is only on the Democrat line.  I filed for six lines:  Conservative, Republican, Common Sense, We The People, Truth and Secure Border.  Addabbo decided to challenge all, except Conservative. I have enough Republican signatures, but the Supreme Court judge denied my challenge affirmations and time to collect more.  I was given 2 hours before going before the referee while all other election law judges gave opponents 3 to 19 days.  Appellate Court accepted some denied affirmations, but rejected those collected after those 2 hours.  Court of Appeals sat on it, and denied my motion in September right before the 45 day ballot mailing deadline. Similarly, the other four independent nominating petitions were ruled off the ballot by the Board of Elections commissioners when I even pointed out the Board did not follow the law.  When I appealed before the Supreme Court, the same judge against my Republican petition would not even sign off on my Order to Show Cause.  When I asked the Appellate Court to force a hearing, it did not sign off on my Order to Show Cause before it was right before the June 25 primary day, though the petition was for the November 5 general.  It does not matter that I showed the court the section of the law that the Board erred. Here is the link with more details should you be interested in view the court documents of all the cases. General Election Ballot 2024 Unfairness is baked into the system.  As long as the victor wins, losers don’t usually get to see the light of day. Let’s talk about issues. Migrant Crisis.  City’s welcome mat housing illegals has done more harm than good.  Illegals need to understand that they are here at the generosity of the system, and the laws say they need to return if rejected. The City is abetting in this criminal enterprise. Budget/Inflation:  Politicians treat them as two separate issues, but they are co-dependent.  When we know how much we get every month, we know how to prioritize our spending.  According to Citizens Budget Commission, NYC collects $10,331 in taxes per capita, and spent near $15,000.  Nearly half of city’s budget is to pay for salary, pension, health of city’s workforce.  With Mayor Adam’s sweetheart union contract renewals, it will easily go over 50%, which means less for programs unless your taxes go up. We know it will.  Politicians have been very good in taking bad issues out of election year headlines.  Congestion pricing, migrant crisis, city’s exodus of its residents while touting programs that will cost more like Local Law 97, new trash cans to fight rats, etc. Career politicians only worry about staying in office, not getting to the bottom of truth or doing what is right.  They thrive on “polarization”, because it drowns out voter attention.  In all the advertisement you see and read, their opponent is evil, and the media repeats it. Why can’t we break bread, and hear each other out?  For club’s meeting tonight, I invited party chairmen of Working Families, Democrat, Republican and Conservative to attend.  No one from Democrat or Working Families replied to my repeated invitation attempts.  I even visited Working Families HQ in Downtown Brooklyn.  No one even met me there.  For club’s September meeting, I invited all Queens Democrats having a Republican challenger to a debate, again, I got silenced.  Even as simple as social held in August, none of the Democrats came. Should I be elected, that would be one of my first promise to our citizens, all views could share the stage.  Solutions should be multi-pronged.  Since the Mayor is willing to consider Sanitation Commission Jessica Tisch for NYPD Commissioner, I recommend an open call for all appointed positions.  I am confident we have a lot of talent not tapped by those in power. For those citizens who felt cheated by the judicial system, their story will be heard. For voters who want to know how their elected officials performed, there should be an easier and fairer way for the public to track. There are more I could say, but let me save it for your questions, if any. Thank you for contacting me. Sincerely, Danniel Maio Post Views: 70 Post navigation General Election Ballot 2024 Checked your absentee ballot status!

Hi Stephanie, Please accept my apology for the delay responding to your request.  In addition to being the State Senator Candidate on the ballot against Joseph Addabbo, I am also the president of Central Queens Republican Club.  We are having a meeting tonight.  Topic:  Judicial Candidates and Roundtable of Party Chairs. My main concern has always been the needs of our citizens.  Yes, I want to win, but when the system is stacked against non-incumbents, a big part of me has to acknowledge the difficulty of the fight. This is my experience.  I lost against Addabbo in 2022, but I got 43% of the votes.  I was on four lines:  Republican, Conservative, Independence and Medical Freedom.  Addabbo, two: Democrat and We The People.  This year, Addabbo is only on the Democrat line.  I filed for six lines:  Conservative, Republican, Common Sense, We The People, Truth and Secure Border.  Addabbo decided to challenge all, except Conservative. I have enough Republican signatures, but the Supreme Court judge denied my challenge affirmations and time to collect more.  I was given 2 hours before going before the referee while all other election law judges gave opponents 3 to 19 days.  Appellate Court accepted some denied affirmations, but rejected those collected after those 2 hours.  Court of Appeals sat on it, and denied my motion in September right before the 45 day ballot mailing deadline. Similarly, the other four independent nominating petitions were ruled off the ballot by the Board of Elections commissioners when I even pointed out the Board did not follow the law.  When I appealed before the Supreme Court, the same judge against my Republican petition would not even sign off on my Order to Show Cause.  When I asked the Appellate Court to force a hearing, it did not sign off on my Order to Show Cause before it was right before the June 25 primary day, though the petition was for the November 5 general.  It does not matter that I showed the court the section of the law that the Board erred. Here is the link with more details should you be interested in view the court documents of all the cases. Unfairness is baked into the system.  As long as the victor wins, losers don’t usually get to see the light of day. Let’s talk about issues. Migrant Crisis.  City’s welcome mat housing illegals has done more harm than good.  Illegals need to understand that they are here at the generosity of the system, and the laws say they need to return if rejected. The City is abetting in this criminal enterprise. Budget/Inflation:  Politicians treat them as two separate issues, but they are co-dependent.  When we know how much we get every month, we know how to prioritize our spending.  According to Citizens Budget Commission, NYC collects $10,331 in taxes per capita, and spent near $15,000.  Nearly half of city’s budget is to pay for salary, pension, health of city’s workforce.  With Mayor Adam’s sweetheart union contract renewals, it will easily go over 50%, which means less for programs unless your taxes go up. We know it will.  Politicians have been very good in taking bad issues out of election year headlines.  Congestion pricing, migrant crisis, city’s exodus of its residents while touting programs that will cost more like Local Law 97, new trash cans to fight rats, etc. Career politicians only worry about staying in office, not getting to the bottom of truth or doing what is right.  They thrive on “polarization”, because it drowns out voter attention.  In all the advertisement you see and read, their opponent is evil, and the media repeats it. Why can’t we break bread, and hear each other out?  For club’s meeting tonight, I invited party chairmen of Working Families, Democrat, Republican and Conservative to attend.  No one from Democrat or Working Families replied to my repeated invitation attempts.  I even visited Working Families HQ in Downtown Brooklyn.  No one even met me there.  For club’s September meeting, I invited all Queens Democrats having a Republican challenger to a debate, again, I got silenced.  Even as simple as social held in August, none of the Democrats came. Should I be elected, that would be one of my first promise to our citizens, all views could share the stage.  Solutions should be multi-pronged.  Since the Mayor is willing to consider Sanitation Commission Jessica Tisch for NYPD Commissioner, I recommend an open call for all appointed positions.  I am confident we have a lot of talent not tapped by those in power. For those citizens who felt cheated by the judicial system, their story will be heard. For voters who want to know how their elected officials performed, there should be an easier and fairer way for the public to track. There are more I could say, but let me save it for your questions, if any. Thank you for contacting me.

Kathy Hochul unveiled her $252 billion budget proposal stuffed with handouts on Tuesday — but she’s already blaming the Trump’s administration if issues arise in propping up the spending plan. Hochul’s has touted the giveaways as part of an “affordability” agenda but that, combined with spiraling spending on Medicaid and school aid have experts worried the Empire State will be on shaky ground in the long run. 4 Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her $252 billion budget proposal. NY Post Illustration Hochul’s proposal includes: $3 billion to fund ‘”inflation rebate” checks: $300 checks would be sent to single New Yorkers who make up to $150,000 per year and $500 for joint tax filers making up to $300,000 per year. $1 billion to fund a “tax cut.” Income taxes would get shaved by .1% for single filers making under $215,400 and married filers making under $323,201. $800 million to expand the child tax credit. The credit would be expanded by up to $1,000 for kids under 4-years-old. $120 million for universal free school meals. Hochul’s budget office said the handouts are being paid for by around $5 billion in surpluses from higher-than-expected tax revenues — but critics warned the governor’s plan gorges on the extra cash for short-term initiatives to boost her 2026 reelection campaign.

Hochul, make sure New York’s assisted suicide bill NEVER becomes law Feds accidentally upload internal memo admitting plan to kill NYC congestion pricing is ‘very unlikely’ to succeed — before quickly deleting it Still, Hochul played the pre-emptive blame game during her budget address, saying the federal government shouldered the fiscal responsibility to deliver on the budget’s promises. “Those who are hurt need to raise their voices and direct that anger at Washington and push their members of Congress to fight for them because New York and other states will simply not be able to shoulder these costs on our own,” Hochul said during her address. “I’m just simply framing where the debate should be,” Hochul later told reporters. 4 Hochul presenting the 2026 executive state budget in the state Capitol on Jan. 21, 2025. Hans Pennink Many New York programs hinge on federal support and the budget would be balanced very delicately, with huge funding contingent on the second Trump administration’s policies. Number crunchers said the budget didn’t do enough to keep the state’s fiscal house in order. See Also Hochul to unveil massive $252B budget proposal but new taxes, fees for MTA remain mystery “Despite strong revenues and continued economic growth, Governor Kathy Hochul’s Executive Budget weakens the State’s fiscal foundation and competitiveness: it balloons spending, fails to restrain unaffordable Medicaid and education spending growth, spreads many ‘affordability’ programs too thin to provide meaningful relief, and extends the ‘temporary’ income tax surcharge,” Citizens Budget Commission President Andrew Rein wrote in a statement Tuesday. “The budget continues New York’s habit of using revenue surges and temporary taxes to build its fiscal house of cards higher.” State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli echoed the concerns. “The state needs to be prepared to assess any actions taken by the new administration in Washington and how they could affect New York’s finances,” DiNapoli said. “As we enter into a time of potential economic uncertainty, a focus on the long-term sustainability of the state’s finances and maintaining a commitment to increasing statutory reserves is necessary.” Gov.

Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images New York will also feel an impact depending on what DC lawmakers decide to do with the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. Some Republicans and Democrats from highly-taxed states like New York want to get rid of the cap, which was implemented as part of the first Trump administration’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While New York’s Republican members of Congress say they’re expecting an increase, they’re not optimistic about repealing it entirely. Hochul is demanding nothing less. “Full repeal or no deal. Let me repeat. Full repeal or no deal,” Hochul said. The budget would also create anticipated deficits in future budgets to the tune of $23.4 billion through the 2029 fiscal year. 4 Hochul’s budget director Blake Washington speaking during the budget presentation in the Capitol’s Red Room. Hans Pennink Hochul’s budget office also acknowledged that it’s looking out for slowing wage and job growth in the Empire State. “Job growth is leveling off? … Yeah, I’m not seeing that.” Hochul questioned when asked by The Post about the concerns noted by her budget wonks. “It’s been on fire,” State Operations Director Kathryn Garcia added. Her budget director, Blake Washington, chimed in to walk back their comments. “Post-pandemic we’re building back, but we saw the higher base. So naturally as, as you get to a higher base, the amount that you grow year to year just slowed down a bit,” Washington said, explaining that the projection is still somewhat of a rebound from the rapid growth seen following the pandemic. Wage growth is expected to slow from 5.4% in the 2025 fiscal year to 3.7% in the 2026 fiscal year, Hochul’s budget office estimates. Still personal income remains high, buoyed particularly by bonuses in the financial and insurance sectors. According to data from the federal reserve, states like Florida and Texas both saw year on year wage growth around 7.2% respectively from 2022 to 2023. New York’s grew 4.7% over the same period. The massive spending proposal for New York — which had an estimated population of just under 20 million last year — represents more than double the $116 billion budget of Florida, which had an estimated 22 million residents in 2024. Texas, with an estimated population of over 30 million, approved a $322 billion budget last year.

Under this system, the Executive is responsible for developing and preparing a comprehensive, balanced budget proposal, which the Legislature modifies and enacts into law.  The Governor is required by the State Constitution to seek and coordinate requests from agencies of State government, develop a “complete” plan of proposed expenditures and the revenues available to support them (a “balanced budget”), and submit a budget to the Legislature along with the appropriation bills and other legislation required to carry out budgetary recommendations.  The Governor is also required by the State Finance Law to manage the budget through administrative actions during the fiscal year. The State’s fiscal year begins April 1 and ends on March 31. However, the actual “budget cycle,” representing the time between early budget preparation and final disbursements, begins some nine months earlier and lasts approximately 27 months – until the expiration of the State Comptroller’s authority to honor vouchers against the previous fiscal year’s appropriations.

When politicians introduce something, it has to make sense in the idea AND execution. If the objective is to reduce cars, the objective most likely will be met.  In its execution, you already know residents and businesses are asking for exemptions and reductions.  They will get it. With fewer cars, more expensive tourist tickets, food delivery…  costs of living and working in Manhattan WILL GO UP. Airport taxi fare was $35 flat fee to Manhattan, $100 per trip is conceivable.  Even traveling within Manhattan below 60 Street, $25 to $50 is not out of question.  If people don’t want to pay that fare, taxis will be out of business. Here is the kicker.  The other objective is to get $1 billion revenue to MTA.  Do you think that will happen when deals are being made?  Cost of installation and maintenance will eat up most of that revenue right away.  It will never happen when car and truck counts are cut. That’s why it’s a bad idea.  Look at London. If it affects your pocketbook and business for same or less quality of service, why pay more?  It’s like rent and real estate tax.  Rent at least goes down sometimes, but not taxes.

In its execution, you already know residents and businesses are asking for exemptions and reductions.  They will get it. With fewer cars, more expensive tourist tickets, food delivery…  costs of living and working in Manhattan WILL GO UP. Airport taxi fare was $35 flat fee to Manhattan, $100 per trip is conceivable.  Even traveling within Manhattan below 60 Street, $25 to $50 is not out of question.  If people don’t want to pay that fare, taxis will be out of business. Here is the kicker.  The other objective is to get $1 billion revenue to MTA.  Do you think that will happen when deals are being made?  Cost of installation and maintenance will eat up most of that revenue right away.  It will never happen when car and truck counts are cut. That’s why it’s a bad idea.  Look at London. If it affects your pocketbook and business for same or less quality of service, why pay more?  It’s like rent and real estate tax.  Rent at least goes down sometimes, but not taxes.

The flailing Metropolitan Transportation Authority estimated total uncollected “toll violations” at more than $1.4 billion in 2024 alone and $3.7 billion combined from 2021 through 2023, according to a financial chart included in a request for proposals submitted to potential debt collectors. And the annual loss in toll revenues could eventually surpass $2 billion in upcoming years when including non-payment of tolls for the new $9 congestion pricing toll to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street, the document projected. 5 The MTA missed out on $5.1 billion in unpaid tolls in the past four years, according to records Christopher Sadowski 5 The missing payments likely rose due to “cashless” toll systems. Obtained by the NY Post “Instead of hitting people with a new and very unfair toll, the MTA should have focused its efforts to get deadbeats to pay existing tolls all along,” said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) of Staten Island and Brooklyn, who is urging President Trump to kill congestion pricing.

Enforce toll and fare beating and punish egregious repeat offenders, not honest hard-working commuters.” The newly surfaced estimate for toll cheating is much larger than what the MTA has indicated in prior public statements. It’s reported that fare and toll evasion combined costs the transit mega-agency $700 million to $800 million a year — and that’s mostly attributed to subway and bus fare cheating rather than toll cheats. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) of the lower Hudson Valley, who is mulling a run for governor, called the apparent loss of toll revenue “really pathetic.” 5 Congestion pricing could cause the MTA to miss out on over $2 billion annually, according to documents. Michael Nagle “Between fare jumpers and toll beaters, the MTA is losing a staggering $2 Billion per year. This level of gross negligence is criminal, plain and simple,” Lawler said. “The MTA needs an immediate forensic audit and a complete purge of its incompetent management team starting with [Janno] Lieber,” he added, referring to the MTA chairman and CEO. The MTA has admitted it is having difficulty getting toll deadbeats to pay up after toll booths were eliminated in 2017 for open-road “cashless” tolling. The toll booths for cash lanes had gates that barred passage without paying. More than 90% of drivers use E-ZPass and the tolls are debited from their account. If they don’t pay, the MTA can shut down their accounts. 5 The MTA previously estimated that fare and toll evasion combined costs the agency $700 million to $800 million a year. Stephen Yang But the overwhelming majority of scofflaws do not have E-ZPass, according to the data. The agency’s readers photograph the license plates of those who don’t pay the toll electronically with an E-ZPass account. These drivers are billed by mail, and therefore the debt is harder to collect. “About 49% of the billed amounts go unpaid, pending further action such as referral to collection,” the MTA said in a report on fare and toll evasion in 2023. See Also NJ offers NY companies grants to allow NJ-based employees to work in Garden State — and avoid congestion toll However, the MTA does not classify failure to pay a bill as “evasion,” as it does for license plate fraud. MTA toll crossings include the Hugh Carey/Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, Queens Midtown Tunnel, Whitestone Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Cross Bay Bridge, Marine Parkway Bridge, Henry Budget Bridge and Robert Kennedy-Triboro Bridge. The MTA didn’t respond to numerous Post inquiries about the gigantic toll cheating cited in its own document sent to debt collection firms. But a source familiar with the bidding process said the numbers are the numbers — and billions of dollars in toll debt was discussed with collection agencies. The loss of revenues to toll beaters is so massive that it’s “too much for any” one firm to handle, though the MTA plans to contract with one company, the source said. Collecting outstanding tolls is a tall task, according to the MTA’s Jan. 17 Q&A session with potential bidders. “As of 2024, our [current] vendor’s rate of return of all inventory is approximately 8.2%,” the MTA said. Drivers billed by mail have 30 days to submit a payment to the MTA’s bridge and tunnel agency, after which a $5 fee is applied for non-payment. After 60 days, the lack of payment activates violation status, with a penalty of $50 for each non-payment. After 60 days, the bill is sent for collection. 5 The MTA estimated toll evasion in 2024 to be over $1.4 billion. Christopher Sadowski MTA officials have some leverage. They can also request the state Department of Motor Vehicles suspend car registrations for persistent toll violators over a five-year period, and there is a reciprocity agreement with Massachusetts to do the same for toll cheats who reside in the Bay State. But the agency says it stops collection efforts on customer accounts that lead to vehicle suspensions. According to a chart the MTA provided to potential bidders, the agency had more than 40 million instances of “placements” or non-payments from 2021 through 2023, totaling $3.786 billion. For 2024, it issued 15.72 million placements or toll non-payments totaling $1.428 billion. With the added congestion toll in place, toll debt could eventually surpass 33,000 non-payments totaling $2.1 billion, the agency said in the bidding document. Critics questioned whether the MTA has the stomach to get tough with toll and fare evaders. The panel that produced the report on fare and toll cheaters in 2023 mentioned “equity” 22 times and wondered whether “toll evasion might be caused by genuine economic need,” and requested further study on whether “possible adjustment to the enforcement approach based on financial hardship” is warranted.

Defend good citizens, not reward wrong behaviors! You paid taxes, and followed the law.  Government wants more, yet those who cheat and steal get free pass(es).  Are those elected protecting yours or their interests? Danniel Maio has faith in the voters, but not in the system. I ran for public office since 2001.  Never won once. Yet, I persist... meeting one voter at a time and helping those however I could. When I was knocked off the Republican line in May, I returned money back to contributors.  Campaigning needs money, but I prefer to earn respect and votes. I filed petitions for four third-party lines:  We The People, Secure Border, Common Sense and Truth. And again, I was knocked off in June. In all, six candidates on the Republican line and one Democrat, who did not have a June primary opponent, were knocked off the ballot this 2024 election cycle.
