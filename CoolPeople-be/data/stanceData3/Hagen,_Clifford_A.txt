MONMOUTH JUNCTION, NJ - A Middlesex County couple has been indicted by a state grand jury on a range of financial crime charges stemming from an alleged Ponzi scheme in which they are accused of defrauding investors of over $2 million between January 2020 and August 2022. According to Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, Swapnil Rege, 50, and Reema Rege, 48 , both of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, were indicted for orchestrating a scheme through their investment entity, Swapstar Capital LLC, that promised exceptionally high annual returns—between 21 and 80 percent—based on what was purported to be profitable securities trading activity. Instead, funds were allegedly diverted for personal use and to provide fake returns to investors, a hallmark of classic Ponzi operations. According to Attorney General Matthew J.

Swapnil Rege, acting as an investment adviser, is accused of stealing stocks worth over $119,000 from one investor’s trading account and misappropriating an additional $100,000 from the same investor’s retirement account. A $100,000 bad check was then allegedly issued by Rege in an attempt to repay the misappropriated funds.
