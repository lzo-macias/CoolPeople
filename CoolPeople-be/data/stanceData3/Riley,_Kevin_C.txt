Riley, MPA ’17 Sworn In As Bronx District 12 Council Member Congratulations to Council Member Kevin C. Riley, MPA’17! January 2021, Mr. Kevin C. Riley started in his newly elected role as Council Member for the 12th district of the Bronx representing the communities of Wakefield, Olinville, Edenwald, Eastchester, Williamsbridge, Baychester and Co-op City. Kevin Riley was born and raised in the Bronx’s 12th Council District. As a lifelong Bronxite, he wanted to bring together the community to which he feels indebted because it took this village to raise this child. Sharing an emotional moment, Kevin said, “ When my Dad got locked-up, my mother locked-in on being a single parent. Her sacrifices will never be in vain. I WILL repay my debt by giving my all and making her proud of calling me her son.” To the 65 percent of voters in his district that decided to take a chance on this young man to represent them in City Hall, he says, “ Thank You. Please understand that I will work hard with purpose, to advocate and prove to you that I am the best person for this job. As we continue to fight COVID-19, many issues have been brought to the forefront including food insecurity, job instability, lack of adequate housing and insufficient resources for our public education system. We need transparency and accountable leaders. “ No stranger to public service, Kevin has served as Community Relations Director for NYS Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, Constituent Liaison for NYS Assembly and District Leader and Vice President for the Bronx Democratic Committee. He also worked for New York Foundling as a Skills Coach where he mentored young men on life skills. Kevin is the father of two beautiful daughters, Brooke V. Riley and Kate C. Riley. Kevin’s kids inspired him and his fraternity brothers to create The Dad Gang , a nationwide organization that works toward eliminating the stereotype that black men are not a part of their children’s lives. Kevin also spends his time as a mentor for President Barack Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative . As a caring, active member of his community, Kevin wanted to create an outlet to help de-escalate the violence in his community. He co-founded Music Over Violence , designed to bring together youth, strengthen familial bonds, and bring awareness to and prevent gun violence. Kevin received his B.A. in Politics, Economics and Law from SUNY Old Westbury and a Master’s of Public Administration from Metropolitan College of New York’s School for Public Affairs and Administration . He graduated from MCNY with a 3.91 GPA and was invited to join the Pi Alpha Alpha honor society. His Constructive Action Plan, a source of pride and accomplishment, titled “Establishing a Better Relationship between Constituents and Elected Officials of the 83rd Assembly District of New York State” has been a blueprint to strengthening relationships within his community, the city and state. At City and State’s Bronx Power 100 event in 2019 – Kevin C. Riley with Bronx Deputy Borough President Marricka Scott-McFadden, MCNY Vice President of Academic Affairs Humphrey Crookendale and MCNY Bronx Campus Director John Edwards. Kevin, Marricka and John were all honored and are graduates of the MCNY MPA program and former students of V.P. Crookendale. In addition to his responsibilities as City Council Member, Kevin C. Riley will also be appointed to serve as chair of the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions. “ As a newly-elected Council Member representing the Bronx’s 12th district, I am honored to be chair of the Council’s Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions Subcommittee. Thank you to Speaker Johnson for this opportunity. I know that the year ahead will be one of great challenges, and I am eager to begin working with affordable housing advocates and the preservation community to advance an agenda that helps all New Yorkers. Together, we can achieve great things,” said Council Member Kevin C. Riley. 2021-01-27T12:40:05-05:00 Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

This decision affirms that MCNY’s program, MSED – Dual Childhood Grades 1-6/Special Education meets all four AAQEP standards, demonstrating both high-quality completer performance and strong program practices. “This national accreditation is a testament to MCNY’s commitment to preparing dedicated and highly skilled educators.

Gibbs, expressed his enthusiasm about this achievement, “The success of our alumni speaks volumes about the quality of this program, and we are incredibly proud of their contributions to the field of education.” This accreditation comes on the heels of MCNY’s Master of Science in Education program celebrating its 20th anniversary, marking two decades of preparing teachers who are passionate about student success. Over the years, the program has produced outstanding educators who have gone on to serve in public, charter, and private schools throughout New York City, transforming lives through education. Dr. Patrick Ianniello, Program Director for MCNY’s Master of Science in Education program , emphasized the program’s impact, “MCNY’s education graduates are among the most passionate, resilient, and effective teachers in education today. They enter the field ready to meet the challenges of making a real difference in the lives of students. This accreditation validates the strength of our program, faculty and commitment.” MCNY’s teacher preparation programs equip aspiring educators with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on experience needed to excel in urban classroom settings. The programs emphasize Purpose-Centered Education, integrating theory with practice to prepare graduates who are both reflective practitioners and community leaders.

MBA in Health Services and Risk Management MBA in Health Services and Risk Management MBA in Health Services and Risk Management 2025-02-26T20:35:53-05:00 Enrollment Options Classes Offered The fully online MBA in Health Services and Risk Management (HSRM) Program at Metropolitan College of New York is designed to meet the life style demands of the working professional in the healthcare services field. This program will enable sector professionals to pursue an MBA degree without interrupting their work schedule, and allowing the option to pursue the goal of advancing to executive positions.  The degree comprises three Purposes, 4 courses in each purpose, totaling 12 courses (36 credits) in the program. All courses will be taught asynchronously and online. This means that there will be no formal class time or scheduled zoom sessions, instead, the students will manage all the learning material and assignments and exams on their own time, and via the MCNY Moodle shell. They will communicate with their professors and classmate remotely and online. The online format presents the advantage of time saving and the flexibility to tailor the work/study schedules to each student’s life routine. However, the privileges of online asynchronous studies are offset by a high degree of discipline on the side of the students to keep up with the study material and to submit the work in a timely manner.

Message from Charles E. Armstrong, Chair, MCNY Board of Trustees 2021 was a challenging year. The COVID-19 pandemic altered —perhaps forever —the way we function as a college, as individuals, and as a society. Adjusting to a new normal of how we can best serve our students and amidst all the change, we continue to strive to build an ever-more equitable and inclusive environment in which all can thrive. The Board of Trustees unanimously supports the College’s mission and leadership, and we remain unwavering in our commitment to delivering a truly Purpose-Centered Education. Diversity at MCNY means equity of representation, equity to effectuate the purpose of opportunity for all through engaging positive educational interaction, constructive action and instruction that inspires our learners to do more and to achieve more. Read more...  Read more... We are excited to report that the Board of Trustees continues to purposefully increase the representation of alumni leaders on the Board who will help lead the college into the future. These esteemed leaders include our Chair-Elect, Gary P. Jenkins. We are heartened to know that the same purpose-centered tools that have enabled our graduates to soar both personally and professionally are now hard at work on the board leading us all to a brighter future. Our administration, staff and teaching professionals have proven to be nimble, adaptable and remarkably resilient as we continue to evolve, adapt and weather these turbulent times. Our collective successes have enabled us to now turn our attention to the ways we will continue to invest in the future. And it is the Board’s belief that through these Constructive Actions of change, MCNY will see clearer skies ahead as the current pandemic, we hope, enters its final phase. Sincerely, Charles Armstrong Board Chair, Metropolitan College of New York  LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT   A Message from Joanne Passaro, PhD In the midst of a very challenging year, MCNY students persevered in their studies in 2021 at levels that far exceeded our expectations. Their courage and tenacity inspired all of us as they persisted despite illness, economic uncertainty and the many inequities of the pandemic. It was deeply gratifying to hear from so many students that these experiences served to reinforce their commitment to lead purposeful change in their communities. Students come to MCNY for that very reason: they know that our powerful curricular model, Purpose-Centered Education, will develop their skills in linking theory with practice and will prepare them, through successive Constructive Action projects, to advance positive change. Read more....  Read more.... Last year, MCNY faculty and staff redoubled their efforts to serve our amazing students. We increased student tuition grants; offered proactive academic and student support services in multiple virtual and on-campus formats; and created safe spaces—within and outside of the classroom—for students to discuss the challenges of the pandemic and support each other in achieving their goals. We continued to offer food pantry services, which became more important than ever, and thanks to Trinity Church Wall Street and other donors, we were able to provide holiday turkeys and groceries to students at both campuses. A generous grant from the Robin Hood Foundation, combined with continued federal COVID relief funding, enabled us to provide emergency funds to students that helped them persist in college while caring for children and loved ones, and navigating changing employment circumstances. Throughout 2021, the MCNY community continued to innovate to support our students and advance our mission. In addition to what I have already described, other examples of their collective efforts include: A new book, The Power of Purpose, was published in January 2021. It highlights the personal journeys of more than twenty MCNY alumni, their experiences with Constructive Action projects, and their impact on our communities. The MS in Education program was recognized by the National Council on Teacher Quality as one of the top programs in the country for “leading the way by maintaining selective academic admissions requirements and driving greater teacher diversity.” Students in the MPA in Emergency and Disaster Management program have been working closely with government, communities, and non-profit organizations to develop recovery and resiliency plans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. An art exhibit commemorating the 10th Anniversary of Occupy Wall Street opened at the Bronx and Manhattan Campuses, with works by artist Carolyn Sortor and photographer Gwenn Levine. The second Purpose Institute was held over two days in the fall. Trustees, current students, alumni, faculty and staff participated in lively discussions about the powerful impact of Purpose-Centered Education with a focus on assuring effective online pedagogies during the pandemic. In the pages that follow you will find other examples of the outstanding, mission- focused work of the MCNY community. Our experiences last year taught us that MCNY’s mission of social justice and community service is more important than ever. The MCNY community is proud of the way we have navigated through the first two years of the pandemic while keeping the needs of our students, and their academic success, at the forefront of our work. We are grateful to our donors for supporting our mission of advancing social justice through Purpose-Centered Education. An investment in MCNY is, indeed, an investment in a stronger and more equitable New York. Thank you for being an integral part of our work.

In addition, you will travel through your course of study each semester with a cohort of 10–20 fellow students. You and your peers will constitute a learning community. Your community shares professors and student teaching experiences. Purpose–Centered Education  Purpose–Centered Education is based on the premise that students achieve high academic standards when they use their knowledge and skills to achieve a meaningful and complex Purpose that makes a positive difference in their own lives and in the lives of others. Purpose  Each semester of study is focused on a specific performance area called a Purpose. These Purposes are the basis around which the semesters’ courses are structured. Achieving mastery in each is critical to a student’s ability to integrate and use the theory learned in the college courses with the high-needs public school placement. Constructive Action  A Constructive Action is a significant endeavor systematically planned, implemented, assessed, and documented each semester at the work or internship site to demonstrate mastery of the MCNY curriculum. As a learning methodology, the Constructive Action process enables a student to develop a body of living case studies, with each focused on a key area of purposeful education and performance. Simultaneously, the process carefully builds analytical, writing, and communication skills. As a practice methodology, the Constructive Action helps the practitioner to prepare comprehensive and realistic plans, act on them effectively, and assess the learning outcomes that have been achieved. As an assessment methodology, it provides an appropriate basis for evaluating the competence of professionals and professionals-in-training.

students—and ongoing advisement for existing ones—to a variety of social and networking opportunities, at MCNY you’ll find the services you need to succeed. As the first step in the registration process, all students must meet with an adviser in the Office of Student Services. It’s the first of at least four contacts—emails, phone calls, classroom visits or appointments—you’ll have with your adviser each semester. F  One-on-one advisement is an essential component to the college experience because it positions students to regularly evaluate their academic progress. During advisement, your advisor will review your academic record with you and help you plan a course schedule for the upcoming semester, preparing you to continue to work towards your degree. When you complete advisement, you will be pre-registered, pending final approval from the registrar . To ensure you are ready to begin classes on the first day of the new semester, it’s best to meet with your advisor as early as possible. Stop by the Office of Student Services or schedule an appointment to meet with an advisor.

Campus Sex Crimes Prevention ActThe Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act (section 1601 of Public Law 106-386) is a federal law enacted on October 28, 2000, that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education, or working or volunteering on campus. The Act amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require sex offenders already required to register in a state to provide notice, as required under state law, of each institution of higher education in that state at which the person is employed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. It also mandates that state procedures ensure that this registration information is promptly made available to law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction where the institutions of higher education are located and that it is entered into appropriate state records or data systems. A listing of all registered sex offenders in New York State is maintained by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. This information is available online at www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/nsor/ . The MCNY Cleary Act Campus Security Report, which contains campus crime statistics, information on the College’s drug and alcohol policies, emergency response and evacuation procedures, and sex offender registry information may be found on the College’s web site at the link below. The College does not maintain residence halls, and thus does not publish an annual fire safety report.

Apply Attend an Event  What is a Community Health Educator?  Community health educators use data collected on various populations to understand and develop health and wellness programs to meet community needs and advocate with governmental agencies for the development of programs and funding to improve community health. They teach people how to live healthy lives, obtain preventive screenings, and avoid costly diseases, medical procedures and unnecessary hospitalizations. They engage in preventive education programs that explain how individuals can reduce the probability of contracting illnesses such as lung cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, heart disease, diabetes, hepatitis and skin cancer and engage community resources in these efforts. In addition, they work in the community to develop programs that cope with expected life changes such as prenatal and well-baby care programs; sex, suicide and drug education programs for teens; and exercise and nutrition programs for senior citizens. They focus on harm reduction strategies to decrease cigarette smoking, excessive drinking, obesity, unprotected sexual behaviors and illicit substance abuse.

Studies in Human Services 2024-05-28T13:42:34-04:00 Enrollment Options Classes Offered The Bachelor of Professional Studies in Human Services program at Metropolitan College of New York is the degree for people who are passionate about improving the lives of others. In modern society, it’s easy for many disadvantaged members of the community to fall through the cracks. Social workers and caseworkers do the work necessary to ensure that the most vulnerable people have access to the assistance they need. This program teaches students how to coordinate supporting activities, processes, and outcomes within community settings or organizations. Graduates typically go on to a variety of careers in counseling, child welfare, social work, education, fundraising, public service, foster care and eldercare. They also find meaningful careers in government, healthcare, health administration, ministry and human resources and probation. This degree is also rooted in the founding of the college. In 1964, educational pioneer Audrey Cohen began offering classes to students in New York City and developed a unique combination of theory and practical learning, which we call Purpose-Centered Education. Today, graduates continue to emerge as true practitioners in this field, prepared with the knowledge and skills to make an impact and contribute as front-line leaders and decision makers. This program is a powerful education in human services that students can only get from MCNY.

Office of Academic Affairs – Institutional Review Board 2025-04-01T12:34:35-04:00  Mission and Responsibilities  The IRB at MCNY is dedicated to ensuring the ethical and responsible conduct of research involving human participants. Its primary role is to safeguard the rights, dignity, and well-being of individuals participating in research studies. The IRB operates in compliance with 45 CFR 46 (Protection of Human Subjects) and adheres to established ethical principles guiding human research. Ensuring the protection of research participants is a shared responsibility among the institution, researchers, the IRB committees, and the IRB Office. Together, these entities work to uphold ethical standards and regulatory requirements for all research conducted under MCNY’s oversight. The MCNY IRB Office oversees the review and approval process for human subject research, ensuring compliance with federal regulations and institutional policies.  Definition of Human Subjects  According to 45 CFR 46.102(f), human subjects are living individuals from whom researchers collect data in one or both of the following ways: 1 1 Through intervention or interaction Intervention : This includes physical procedures (e.g., collecting blood samples) or controlled modifications to a participant’s environment (e.g., adjusting room temperature) conducted for research purposes. Interaction : Any direct communication between researchers and participants, such as interviews or surveys, falls under this category. 2 2 Through identifiable private information Private information : Data related to behaviors or personal records that individuals expect to remain confidential, such as medical history, financial records, or personal experiences. Identifiable information : Any data that could reveal an individual’s identity, such as names, addresses, or unique identifiers.  IRB Submission Categories  Researchers submitting studies for IRB review should be aware of the different submission types and their requirements: Initial Studies: New research proposals involving human subjects that require IRB approval before data collection begins.  Initial Studies: New research proposals involving human subjects that require IRB approval before data collection begins. Modifications: Any changes to an approved study, including protocol adjustments, consent form updates, or changes in study personnel, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before implementation.  Modifications: Any changes to an approved study, including protocol adjustments, consent form updates, or changes in study personnel, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before implementation. Continuing Review & Closure: Studies that require ongoing IRB oversight must undergo periodic review. Researchers must also formally close studies once data collection and analysis are complete.  Continuing Review & Closure: Studies that require ongoing IRB oversight must undergo periodic review. Researchers must also formally close studies once data collection and analysis are complete. Reportable New Information (RNI): Researchers must promptly report any unexpected risks, adverse events, or deviations from the approved protocol that may impact participants’ safety or the integrity of the study.  Reportable New Information (RNI): Researchers must promptly report any unexpected risks, adverse events, or deviations from the approved protocol that may impact participants’ safety or the integrity of the study.

More resources  More resources Research Ethics & Historical Foundations Nuremberg Code (1948) The Nuremberg Code was established following the Nuremberg Trials, which prosecuted war crimes committed during World War II. It was the first international document to define ethical standards for human subjects research, emphasizing voluntary participation and informed consent. The Code arose in response to unethical medical experiments conducted in Nazi Germany and remains a cornerstone of research ethics today. Declaration of Helsinki (1964, Revised 2013) Developed by the World Medical Association (WMA), the Declaration of Helsinki provides ethical guidance for physicians and researchers conducting studies involving human subjects. It extends the principles of the Nuremberg Code, particularly regarding informed consent, risk minimization, and the protection of vulnerable populations. The declaration is regularly updated, with the most recent revision in October 2013, and serves as the foundation for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines worldwide. National Research Act (1974) In response to the unethical Tuskegee Syphilis Study, Congress passed the National Research Act in 1974. This legislation established Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to oversee research involving human subjects and created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission was tasked with defining ethical principles to ensure human subjects are protected in research. The Belmont Report (1978) Published by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects, The Belmont Report outlines three fundamental ethical principles guiding human research: Respect for Persons – Recognizing the autonomy of individuals and ensuring informed consent. Beneficence – Maximizing benefits while minimizing potential harm to participants. Justice – Ensuring fair distribution of research risks and benefits. The Belmont Report serves as the foundation of U.S. research ethics regulations and remains a key reference for IRBs, including at MCNY.

Refunds are distributed to the student by BankMobile Disbursements based upon the refund preference selected by the student on https://bankmobiledisbursements.com/refundchoices/ . Please note that MCNY disburses aid in the following order: loans, federal grants, state (TAP) grants, and lastly institutional scholarships. Hence, student refunds usually occur towards the end of the semester. Students may review their student account (financial aid awards and billing statements for instance) on the Self-Service website.

Return of Title IV Funds  Return of Title IV Funds This policy applies to students who complete 60% or less of the enrollment period (i.e., Fall, Spring or Summer session) for which they received Federal Title IV aid. A student who drops a class but still completes one or more classes does not qualify for the Return of Title IV Funds policy. The term “Title IV aid” refers to the following Federal financial aid programs: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans, Subsidized Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants, and Federal SEOG (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant). To conform to the policy, Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) must determine the student’s approved leave of absence date or withdrawal date. The withdrawal date is based on the earlier of the two: The last date of attendance at an academically-related activity by a student, or the date the student began the withdrawal process or officially notified MCNY of their intent to withdraw. The calculation required determines a student’s earned and unearned Title IV aid based on the percentage of the enrollment period completed by the student. The percentage of the period that the student remained enrolled is derived by dividing the number of days the student attended by the number of days in the period. Calendar days (including weekends) are used, but breaks of at least 5 days are excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Until a student has passed the 60% point of an enrollment period, only a portion of the student’s aid has been earned. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60% point is considered to have earned all awarded aid for the enrollment period. Session 01 14-week (98 days) Semester Withdrawal submitted Before or during weeks 1-2 100% return During weeks 3-4 75% return During week 5 65% return During week 7 50% return During week 8 40% return (60% of course is completed week 8.42) During weeks 9-14 (0% returned) Sessions A, B and E 7-Week (49 days) Semester Withdrawal submitted Before or during weeks 1-2 75% return During weeks 3-4 50% return During week 4 40% return (60% of course is completed week 4.21) During week 6-7 (0% returned) Earned aid is not related in any way to institutional charges. In addition, the College’s refund policy and Return of Title IV Funds procedures are independent of one another. A student who was approved for a leave of absence or withdraws for the semester, may be required to return unearned aid and still owe the college for the course(s). The responsibility to repay unearned Title IV aid is shared by MCNY and the student. For example, the calculation may require MCNY to return a portion of Federal funds to the Federal Title IV programs. In addition, the student may also be required to return funds based on the calculation. A student returns funds to the Federal Direct Loan programs based on the terms and conditions of the promissory note of the loan. A student who receives a Federal Pell Grant may be required to repay 50% of the funds received. The return of Federal aid is in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans, Subsidized Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants, and Federal SEOG (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant).

2023-10-17T15:48:29-04:00 Dear MCNY Community, I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. I am pleased to announce the commencement of the planning process for the Academic Master Plan (2023-2028). As we embark on this transformative journey, our collective commitment to fostering academic excellence and promoting equity, social justice, and purpose-centered education remains our guiding star. The Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) has been instrumental in constituting three dynamic working groups that will be at the heart of the development of our Academic Master Plan: Curriculum Re-design & Innovation Dedicated to sculpting the future of academic pathways in Business, Human Services & Education, and Public Affairs and Administration, this group will ensure our curriculum remains forward-thinking, socially responsive, and rooted in purpose-centered education. Teaching Excellence & Scholarship Our objective here is to amplify teaching effectiveness, quality assurance, implement high impact practices, and bolster scholarship. This working group will also coordinate on grants, research, and scholarly pursuits within the aforementioned disciplines. Student Engagement & Success The very core of our institution is our students. This group is dedicated to crafting strategies that will heighten student success encompassing areas like retention, completion, transfers, and career progression. For those joining these pivotal working groups, this is a golden opportunity to influence the trajectory of our academic offerings and be instrumental in the success stories of our students, particularly focusing on the elevation of our student population, especially Hispanic and African American adult learners. Our united efforts will ensure an Academic Master Plan that is in perfect sync with our esteemed mission and overarching strategic objectives. Outlined below is the timeline that charts the course of our plan’s development: Spring 2023 Discerning the OAA’s top priorities through data collection. Summer 2023 A meticulous SWOT analysis, formation and appointment of working groups, faculty surveys, and defining of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Fall 2023 The drafting, finalization, and endorsement of pivotal Academic Master Plan documents, along with the inauguration of a website dedicated to OAA’s Strategic Priorities & Initiatives. In closing, each one of you embodies the spirit of MCNY, and I am profoundly grateful for your dedication. Let’s unify in our quest to craft a future that resonates with academic brilliance and is deeply entrenched in inclusivity.

T he Master of Science in Project Management is for people pursuing a career in project management, who see themselves managing projects or overseeing complex undertakings.

A degree in project management aims to teach how to think critically and implement leadership theories and methodologies in real-life situations. T  While earning a project management degree, students cultivate the knowledge and skills necessary to complete project-based work in diverse industries. The MS in Project Management will prepare professionals with budgeting, leadership, communication, and organization skills. Students will learn resource allocation, time management, strategies and negotiation, initiation and planning, implementation and closure. Qualified Project Managers are an invaluable asset to any business, non-profit agency or corporation. Graduates can secure positions in education, government and community affairs, engineering, computer and information systems, healthcare industries, construction, corporations and most other industries. The global economy is becoming more and more interdependent and a degree in project management teaches versatile skills enabling professionals to move fluidly between industries. Project managers are in very high demand across all sectors. A critical part in the development of a student’s Constructive Action (CA) is the field placement. Students will be required to apply what they have learned in the classroom with experience in real-world situations, companies or organizations. As such, they must identify their proposed venture for their Constructive Actions. In the three CAs of the proposed curriculum, students will acquire basic research techniques and methodologies necessary to explore and analyze trends and needs, relate those needs to their respective proposed professional venture, develop a comprehensive strategic plan, and finally set in motion their respective entrepreneurial plans by identifying sources of financing and evaluating their success and failures.

Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1, 2020 Since its founding by Audrey Cohen in 1964, Metropolitan College of New York has been committed to overcoming the impacts of systemic racism by creating new educational pathways for Black and Latinx adults. MCNY is proud of the role that Purpose-Centered Education has played in empowering students to be agents of constructive change; for over fifty years MCNY alumni have been at the front lines in promoting social and racial justice in our workplaces and communities. But as the nation’s awareness of the persistence of anti-Black and anti-Brown violence has grown, we aspire to, and we will, do more. The MCNY Board of Trustees will extend the College’s commitment to social justice in order to more intentionally advance practices of diversity, anti-racism and inclusion within the College and across the City. We know that many of our students and colleagues live with the daily fear of racist violence, and we recognize that those of us who are not subject to this reality have a moral responsibility to humbly listen, learn, and engage in sustained practices of promoting anti-racism, diversity and inclusion. Metropolitan College of New York will continue to advance equity and inclusion and empower people from diverse backgrounds to participate in the work of the College and of the Board by the following actions: Expanding the Board of Trustees and assuring that Board leadership includes members from diverse backgrounds. Recruiting and retaining a diverse faculty and staff at all levels of the College. Amplifying the voices of our students and alumni—in our classrooms, campus-wide discussions, and public events—to better understand their experiences and celebrate their contributions to positive change. Mobilizing faculty and staff to strengthen teaching and learning about anti-racism, especially in the design of Constructive Action projects, and providing them with access to the resources needed to accomplish this. Working with hiring managers across for-profit, nonprofit and government sectors to promote best practices for sourcing, screening and hiring qualified Black and Brown talent. Enhancing our community partnerships to advance practices of anti-racism and equity in our communities. Raising our voices in the name of anti-racism and equity in personal and professional settings; we will not be silent bystanders. We recognize that these actions are a starting point. Reversing the effects of centuries of racism will require sustained and dedicated action over many years. The MCNY community—the President, Board of Trustees, faculty and staff— is committed to that work. We will continue to listen, learn, and act in the name of social justice. United we stand.

Can you recommend specific courses I should take? What skills are necessary to succeed in this field? What other fields relate to your college major? Where does this career path lead?

Office of Accommodation and Accessibility Services adheres to the professional, legal, and ethical guidelines established by the Federal Government, the State of New York and the Association on Higher Education and Disability. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of education records.

Once the student turns 18, these rights transfer to the student and parents then no longer have access to a student’s records without the student’s consent, with the exception of a parent who claims a student for income tax purposes. Generally, schools must have written permission from the student in order to release any information from a student’s record. However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent under the following circumstances: School officials with a legitimate educational interest Other schools to which a student is transferring Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student Organizations conducting research studies for or on behalf of the school Accrediting organizations In response to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law Student Rights and Responsibilities Students with disabilities are expected to abide by the rights and responsibilities listed below.

More about Title IX Know your rights Discrimination/Harassment Reporting and Resolution Process Metropolitan College of New York is committed to providing a learning and working environment not impaired by unlawful discrimination or harassment, including discrimination and harassment based on race, color, sex, gender, pregnancy, religion, creed, marital status, partnership status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, disability, military status, or any other legally protected category. The College’s internal grievance procedure outlined below is designed to further the equitable and prompt resolution of complaints and address the effects of harassment and discrimination. Students, employees, and third parties may file a complaint using these procedures. These procedures apply to discriminatory and harassing conduct carried out by employees, students, and third parties. All College staff members who observe potentially discriminatory or harassing conduct should intervene where it is possible and safe to do so and promptly report the incident to the College’s 504 Coordinator. The College reserves the right to reasonably extend any timeframe outlined below as may be necessary given the facts of the case, the parties involved, and academic calendar. Reporting Misconduct Anyone who feels that he or she has experienced or witnessed harassment or discrimination by a student, employee, or third party may file a written complaint with the College’s 504 Coordinator either in person or by email. The College’s 504 Coordinator is named below and can be reached at: Clotilde Ibarra Dean of Students Title IX Coordinator/504 Coordinator Metropolitan College of New York 60 West Street New York, NY 10006 (212) 343-1234 ext. 2800; cibarra@mcny.edu Investigation Upon receipt of a complaint of harassment and/or discrimination the 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will initiate an investigation. An investigation will consist of meeting with the complainant and anyone else the complainant identifies as having relevant information. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will also meet with the person alleged to have committed the harassment or discrimination. Both the complainant and the respondent will have the opportunity to submit evidence and information as well as identify witnesses. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will explain to each party separately their rights under this and other relevant College policies as well as discuss the supportive resources and interim measures available. An investigation will generally be completed within 20 business days of receipt of a complaint. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will complete an Investigation Report generally within 10 business days of the close of an investigation. That Report will be maintained in the 504 Coordinator’s Office. Interim Measures The College may implement interim measures to protect the safety and well-being of those who report or experience discrimination/harassment, as well as those who have been accused of such conduct. Interim measures may include, and will depend on the availability of College resources, the nature and severity of the allegations, and the parties involved: changes in class schedules, changes in work assignments/supervisors, academic support, and/or temporary no-contact orders. The College is able to refer those involved in a harassment or discrimination complaint to a variety of community-based counseling and support resources. For more information about the resources that exist any individual (student, employee, visitor) may contact the 504 Coordinator or the Dean of Students’ Office. Resolution The Investigation Report will be forwarded to an appropriate and impartial administrative officer for consideration and determination as to whether harassment or discrimination occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence. The parties will be notified in writing of the College’s determination. Generally, a determination will be completed within 14 business days of the administrative officer’s receipt of the Investigation Report, but may take a reasonably longer period of time depending on the facts, the availability of the parities, the College’s academic calendar, complexity of the case, and other factors specific to each case. The administrative officer’s final determination may contain a recommended sanction depending on the nature of the findings. Remedies/Sanctions Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, training, written warnings, suspension, and expulsion/termination from the College. The College may take additional steps to address discriminatory effects of the misconduct and to prevent recurrence. Such steps will depend on the nature and extent of the discrimination or harassment, but may include mandatory training/counseling for the perpetrator of the misconduct, campus-wide or targeted trainings, campus outreach, and/or reasonable academic/emotional support for those affected by the misconduct. Appeal Either party may appeal the administrative officer’s decision within 10 business days of notification of the College’s determination. The appeal must be made in writing to the Appeal Officer designated by the College in its determination letter. Appeals will be limited to circumstances where a party makes a compelling argument that: (1) there was a procedural error in the investigation or hearing of the complaint, and/or (2) relevant evidence has become available that was not available during the investigation or hearing. Appeals will be conducted in an impartial manner by an impartial Appeal Officer. The decision of the Appeal Officer is final and will be delivered to both parties within 10 business days of receipt of the appeal. Retaliation The College strictly prohibits any form of retaliation, intimidation, or reprisal for making a complaint of harassment or discrimination or otherwise participating in the investigation and resolution process.

School For Human Services & Education CASAC Program CASAC Program CASAC Program 2024-12-05T22:58:21-05:00 The Audrey Cohen School for Human Services and Education offers a 350-hour, non-degree certificate program in Substance Use Disorder (including Alcohol and Nicotine Dependence), and Gambling Counseling. The program focuses on the psychopharmacological and physiological aspects of drugs; signs, symptoms, and stages of alcoholism; individual and group counseling skills; the ethics of confidentiality; family treatment; and multicultural issues including cultural competence. It meets the OASAS educational requirement for the CASAC credential. In addition to the 350-hour course course curriculum, students are required to complete eight online trainings designated by OASAS. These must all be completed before receiving (a) certificate of completion. Courses are offered online on a continuous basis and may be completed in two semesters. Classes are small and taught by OASAS-qualified instructors. Courses are scheduled on a rotating basis on Monday-Thursday evenings and during the day on Saturday. Courses are offered during the spring, summer, and fall terms. The program utilizes a pass/fail grading system and takes into consideration class participation, class attendance, and competency in course assignments and activities. Prospective students are encouraged to apply to take one or more courses based on their own schedules and course offerings. Students may take CASAC classes in any order. Those who complete all eight courses may be eligible for up to 9 credits towards their Bachelor’s degree in Human Services at MCNY. MCNY only provides the educational component required for the CASAC credential. It is recommended that students find employment that meets the OASAS guidelines for work experience.

2024-08-19T15:24:00-04:00 Message From the President   Dr. Charles J. Gibbs Dear Scholars, Welcome to Metropolitan College of New York! As Metropolitan College of New York’s 7th president, I am elated to begin this journey alongside you and our entire MCNY community. Together with our dedicated faculty and staff, I am committed to uplifting you on a path to personal and professional success. Whether you are studying in Manhattan, the Bronx, or online, our community’s shared goal is to see you thrive and succeed. MCNY is a place where all voices are heard, and self-expression is encouraged. I want you to ask yourself, why are you here? What is your purpose? At MCNY, our purpose is to see you excel. Our purpose is to help you succeed and to be the best version of yourself. Our purpose is for you to grow and contribute to the communities and workplaces you serve. You have made the right choice—selecting MCNY—if your goal is to grow and have an impact on all you encounter. MCNY upholds the promise our founder Audrey Cohen made 60 years ago; “to provide access to Purpose-Centered Education that advances educational, social and wealth equity.” MCNY empowers scholars to reach their full potential while making a positive impact on their communities. Each semester, through ‘Constructive Action’ you will apply your knowledge in real-world settings, solving problems and driving meaningful change in your academic realms, workplaces and beyond, alongside our world-class faculty and staff. Our success is measured by your success. Through you, our mission extends far beyond graduation. MCNY alumni can be found changing public policy, becoming thriving entrepreneurs, managing non-profits, leading government agencies, and educating future leaders as community mentors. We take pride in the accomplishments of our alums who work to facilitate and promote equity for all. In a world with an abundance of information, yet often lacking in understanding, we are called to be agents of change. Therefore, when you graduate, I ask you to do more than open the door for someone else. Wield your power to empower others and bring them along. MCNY is ready to further build your integrity, spark your innovation, build your empowerment, and support your diversity. Welcome to MCNY. We believe in what we do, we believe in you and we are excited to be part of your powerful and purposeful journey. TOGETHER, we will move MCNY Forward!

Gibbs View Larger Image Writing the Next Chapter: Together…We Rise! Black History Month is not just about reflection—it is about recognition, truth, and the responsibility to shape what comes next. For too long, Black history has been sanitized, rewritten, or erased altogether. But history lives in the people who continue to push forward, defy limits, and build futures that were once unimaginable. At Metropolitan College of New York, we honor Black history not as a distant past but as a living force—one that speaks to endurance, resistance, and resilience. Our founders, our leaders, our alumni, and our students all represent the power of history—then, now, and in the making. They remind us that recognition is not about comfort; it is an act of defiance, a refusal to be silenced, and a commitment to truth. But honoring history alone is not enough. We must claim, preserve, and celebrate the Black future. At a time when equity and justice are under attack—when books are banned, history is distorted, and opportunity is denied—we must ask ourselves, “What comes next?” The answer is found in education, advocacy, and action. It lies in challenging systemic injustice—whether in education, wealth, or healthcare. It is in ensuring that future generations, including our children and grandchildren, inherit a world that values their brilliance and potential rather than diminishes their contributions. MCNY’s mission has always been about Purpose-Centered Education—learning that transforms lives and communities while elevating and amplifying the connection between theory and practice. In that spirit, we celebrate the Black future because, every single day, we are writing the next chapter. We are the authors of what comes next. So, this Black History Month, let us not only reflect—let’s build, inspire, and reclaim. Because the Black future is not just ahead of us—it is happening now. And Black History Month is every day, 365 days a year. Let’s celebrate the Black future! Together…We Rise! Dr. Charles J.

Financial Aid FAQ Financial Aid FAQ 2018-04-09T12:23:42-04:00 What is Satisfactory Academic Progress 2017-04-20T11:11:10-04:00 What is Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Federal regulations (Sections 668.16(e).668.32(f) and 668.34)   require that schools monitor the academic progress of each applicant for federal financial assistance and that the school certify that the applicant is making satisfactory academic progress toward earning his/her degree. This determination of progress is made at the end of each semester (fall, spring and summer) for all full-time and part-time undergraduate and graduate degree candidates . The review includes a determination as to whether the student has met the cumulative qualitative and quantitative standards set forth in the College’s SAP policy. Specifically included in the review is a measurement of the student’s Pace to ensure that the student will complete the program within the maximum timeframe. Students will be notified in writing of the results of an evaluation that impacts the student’s eligibility for federal and institutional financial assistance. Qualitative SAP Standards 2.0 cumulative Grade Point Average for undergraduates 3.0 cumulative Grade Point Average for graduates Quantitative SAP Standards (PACE and Maximum Timeframe) PACE: Students must have earned at least 67% of their attempted course credits to be considered to be meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress minimum standards. In other words, a student’s pace is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of credits that the student has successfully completed by the cumulative number of credits that the student has attempted. Maximum Timeframe :  Students are permitted to receive federal student aid up to the maximum timeframe of 150% of the published length of the education program in attempted and transfer credits. Students are not eligible to receive federal financial assistance beyond this point. Example: Published length of an Associate of Arts in Human Services is 60 credits. Students are permitted to receive federal student aid up to the maximum of 90 credits in pursuant of an Associate Degree. Transfer credits are counted in both the cumulative number of successfully completed and attempted credits. Attempted credits include incompletes (I and EI), repeated courses, failures (FNS, FWD and F), or withdrawals (WP). Repeated courses Students may not receive financial aid for more than one repetition of a previously passed course. Courses repeated due to an earlier failing grade are eligible for federal student aid if the course is a requirement for the student’s degree program. Withdrawals Attempted hours are those hours for which students were still officially registered at the conclusion of each semester’s Add/Drop period. Withdrawals made after the close of the Add/Drop period are classified with a grade of “WP”, and are counted as courses attempted and toward the maximum time frame for eligibility. Withdrawals made during the Add/Drop period do not count as attempted hours. Change in Majors Students who change their majors will normally be expected to complete all degree requirements before reaching 150% maximum time of normal program completion. Reviewing SAP Students meeting all minimum SAP standards are packaged for the full academic year. Students not meeting all minimum standards are subject to financial aid warning and suspension of financial aid eligibility. Alternatively, students may appeal the decision to regain eligibility. Financial Aid Warning Students who drop below the required qualitative and quantitative standards will receive a Financial Aid Warning for one semester. Maintaining/Regaining Eligibility Students can regain eligibility for financial assistance after the warning period as soon as they meet the qualitative and quantitative standards for SAP as stated above. Financial Aid Suspension A student on financial aid warning who has not met all SAP qualitative and quantitative standards by the end of the next semester of enrollment and who does not have an approved appeal on file with the financial aid office is no longer eligible to receive financial aid assistance. A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at MCNY at his/her own expense and demonstrating that he/she is capable of completing a semester without any failures, incompletes or withdrawals and showing the ability to complete his degree requirements in a more regular fashion. Right to Appeal A student who becomes ineligible for financial aid (after receiving a financial aid warning and suspension) may submit a Satisfactory Academic Progress Request for Review to the Director of Financial Aid Office including the following information: Explanation of mitigating circumstance such as death of a family member, or a student’s personal illness or injury that resulted in the failure to meet SAP, Explanation of what has changed that will allow student to demonstrate SAP progress at the end of the next evaluation period, and/or An “academic plan of action” completed with an academic advisor. The appeal along with all required statements and documentation will usually be reviewed by the Director of Financial Aid within ten business days of receipt of appeal. The Director of Financial Aid will consider waiving the SAP standards for a student who documents mitigating circumstances that contributed to their academic difficulties. In some cases, it may be mathematically impossible for a student to repair his or her SAP deficiencies with one term of enrollment. In such cases, a student’s SAP appeal may be approved with an academic plan to restore SAP deficiencies over more than one term. In these cases, the Office of Student Services in consultation with the Director of Financial Aid will develop an academic plan with the student that, if followed, will ensure that the student is able to meet the College’s SAP standards by a specific point in time. The academic plan may require the student to fulfill specific terms and conditions, such as taking a reduced course load or enrolling in specific courses. Financial Aid Probation Students who do not meet the qualitative and quantitative standards and have successfully appealed to regain their financial aid eligible are placed on Financial Aid Probation. Students on financial aid probation retain both federal and institutional aid eligibility for one semester or as stated on the academic plan of action. If the student continues to not meet the minimum SAP standards, s/he is no longer eligible for federal or institutional aid until these standards is met. New York State TAP Program Pursuit and Academic Progress Eligibility Charts To be eligible for TAP, you must be a full -time matriculated student. New York State regulations require recipients to maintain satisfactory academic progress and program pursuit. The charts below outline each TAP payment requirements.

It is important to note that the number of credit hours that must be completed and earned depends on the number of TAP payments the student has received, not on the year of enrollment. Visit the NYS HESC website for full information. Waiver of Academic Standing Requirement Students who are academically ineligible for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) due to a documentable circumstance may apply for a one-time waiver of the Academic Progress/Programs Pursuit requirements and a one-time waiver of the grade point average requirement. However, multiple waivers for the TAP progress and pursuit requirements are not granted. Valid circumstances include illness, death of a family member, or other situations that may have adversely affected their academic work. Students who would like to be considered for a TAP waiver should contact the Office of the Registrar. How do I apply for veterans’ benefits? 2017-02-13T19:13:18-05:00 How do I apply for veterans’ benefits?

What other sources of financial aid should I check out? 2017-02-13T17:57:24-05:00 What other sources of financial aid should I check out?

Should I report it to the financial aid office? 2017-02-13T17:51:50-05:00 I got an outside scholarship. Should I report it to the financial aid office? Yes. If you are receiving any kind of financial aid from sources outside of MCNY, you must report the scholarship to the Financial Aid Office. We may adjust your financial aid package to compensate. Nevertheless, the outside scholarship will have some beneficial effects. For instance, outside scholarships may be used to replace loans. Can I get Pell for repeating a course? 2017-02-13T17:51:24-05:00 Can I get Pell for repeating a course? Sometimes if a higher minimum grade in a major course is required, you can receive federal aid again for that course. You should remember that repeating a course may limit your ability to meet the Satisfactory Academic Performance requirements for receipt of federal student aid. What is a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)? 2017-02-13T17:51:01-05:00 What is a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)? FSEOGs are awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need, i.e., those with the lowest expected family contribution (EFC) numbers. Federal Pell Grant recipients receive priority for FSEOG awards. How do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of need-based aid? 2017-02-13T17:50:27-05:00 How do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of need-based aid? You should file a FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov and indicate your interest in student employment and student loans by checking the appropriate boxes on the FAFSA. Checking these boxes does not commit you to accepting these types of aid. You will have the opportunity to accept or decline each part of your aid package later. Leaving these boxes unchecked will not increase the amount of grants you receive. What is a federal Pell Grant? 2017-02-13T17:49:56-05:00 What is a federal Pell Grant? Pell Grants are the foundation of federal student aid, to which aid from other federal and nonfederal sources might be added. Pell Grants are for undergraduate students. How much aid can I get? 2017-02-13T17:49:35-05:00 How much aid can I get? Aid from most programs is awarded based on financial need (except for unsubsidized and PLUS loans). An expected family contribution (EFC) number is used to determine need. The EFC is a measure of your family’s financial strength and is calculated from the information you report on the FAFSA. To be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, your EFC must be below a certain number, which can vary from year to year. The EFC (expected family contribution) formula must be applied to each family’s financial information, so we can’t tell you here whether you’ll be eligible for federal student aid or estimate how much aid you might get. You will need to apply to find out exactly how much you will be eligible for. If you want to see exactly how the EFC formula works, you can get detailed worksheets from the website www.studentaid.ed.gov/pubs . Click on the year under The EFC Formula. Who gets financial aid? 2017-02-13T17:48:47-05:00 Who gets financial aid? The financial aid administrator at your college can help determine what you’re eligible for. There are, however, some basic guidelines for all applicants. They must: Demonstrate financial need; this means that your cost of education is greater than your family contribution. Be working toward a degree. Be enrolled in an eligible program. Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, be a New York state resident for NY state aid (TAP). Have a valid Social Security number. Be registered with the Selective Service (if required). Maintain academic progress once in college. Have a high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) certificate. Not be convicted of selling or possessing illegal drugs while receiving aid. Not be in default of federal student loans or state student loans for NY state financial aid (TAP). Do I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid at a particular university? 2017-02-13T17:48:07-05:00 Do I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid at a particular university? No. You can apply for financial aid any time after January 1. To actually receive funds, however, you must be admitted and enrolled at the college. I probably don’t qualify for aid. Should I apply for aid anyway? 2017-02-13T17:47:33-05:00 I probably don’t qualify for aid. Should I apply for aid anyway? Yes. Many families mistakenly think they don’t qualify for aid and prevent themselves from receiving financial aid by failing to apply for it. In addition, there are a few sources of aid such as unsubsidized Direct and PLUS loans that are available regardless of need. The FAFSA form is free. There is no good excuse for not applying. Do I have to reapply for financial aid every year? 2017-02-13T17:47:07-05:00 Do I have to reapply for financial aid every year? Yes. You must apply for financial aid every year. If your financial circumstances change, you may get more or less aid. Note that your eligibility for financial aid may change significantly, especially if you have a different number of family members in college. Renewal of your financial aid package also depends on making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree, such as earning a minimum number of credits and achieving a minimum GPA. How soon after January 1 should the FAFSA form be sent in? Is it better to wait until the income tax forms have been completed? 2017-02-13T17:43:25-05:00 How soon after January 1 should the FAFSA form be sent in? Is it better to wait until the income tax forms have been completed? Send in the form as soon as possible after January 1. Do not wait until your taxes are done. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is ok to use estimates of your income, so long as they aren’t very far off from the actual values. You will have an opportunity to correct any errors later. If you wait too long, you might miss the deadline for scholarships and/or campus based aid such as work-study. Why can’t I submit my financial aid application before January 1? 2017-02-13T17:42:39-05:00 Why can’t I submit my financial aid application before January 1? The need analysis process for financial aid uses the family’s income and tax information from the most recent tax year to judge your eligibility for need-based financial aid during the upcoming academic year. Since the base year ends December 31, you cannot submit a financial aid application until January 1. When should I apply? 2017-02-13T17:42:15-05:00 When should I apply? You can apply for financial aid even before you’ve been accepted to a college or soon after you file your taxes. Most applicants follow this guideline: For summer and fall , we recommend that you apply immediately after January 1, but not before this date. Any application that is received before January 1 for the fall semester of the following year will not be processed and you’ll have to reapply. For spring , we recommend that you apply before November so that your financial aid application is processed before you begin classes. I missed the link to TAP on the website when I completed my FAFSA online. Can I get it done any other way? 2017-02-13T17:41:48-05:00 I missed the link to TAP on the website when I completed my FAFSA online. Can I get it done any other way? Yes. You could wait until you receive either an email or a postcard with the Web address of TAP on the Web or you can visit www.tapweb.org . You can then set up a PIN number, which will allow you to access the TAP on the website and you can complete your TAP application and have it submitted to HESC. You can also call 1-800-433-3243 for help with filling out your FAFSA. You can also call 1-888-697-4372 for help with filling out your TAP. I don’t think I’ll be eligible for a TAP grant. Why should I bother to complete the application? 2017-02-13T17:40:55-05:00 I don’t think I’ll be eligible for a TAP grant. Why should I bother to complete the application? You’ll never know if you are eligible for TAP until you apply. By applying, New York State will determine whether you are eligible for a TAP grant. The application is free and you just might qualify. Many students who are not eligible for Pell Grants still qualify for TAP. How do I apply for TAP? 2017-02-13T17:40:28-05:00 How do I apply for TAP? The TAP (Tuition Assistance Program) application is for New York State residents to apply for NY State financial aid. Once you complete your FAFSA online, you will get to the Confirmation Page.  Click on the link to apply for New York State-based financial aid and you will be directed to the Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) website in order to fill out your TAP application. If you miss the link, you will get an email within a week from HESC with information on how to complete your TAP application. If you do not supply an email address on your FAFSA, you will be notified by a postcard on how to complete your TAP application. How do I apply for financial aid? 2017-02-13T17:37:44-05:00 How do I apply for financial aid? You can complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) electronically from your computer or with a paper application. The FAFSA is the application form required for all federal and state aid. The FAFSA form can be found on the Web at www.fafsa.ed.gov . If you don’t have a computer, you can use one at your library or Student Financial Service’s computer lab. This is an interactive Web page. You’ll be able to fill out the application online and submit it over the Internet. Be assured that your answers will be kept confidential.

Employment growth is expected to be driven by the formation of new organizations and expansion of existing ones, which should require more workers to manage these operations. The median annual wage for management occupations was $109,760 in May 2020, which was the highest wage of all the major occupational groups.

Gary P. Jenkins, MPA’06 To the MCNY Community, To the MCNY Community, It’s good to come home! As I write this message just one year into being Board Chair, I am reminded that there is nothing like feeling welcomed, being supported and sharing a common goal of improving the workplaces and communities in which we work and live. This goal was the reason I enrolled in MCNY’s School of Public Administration in 2005. Years later as a graduate, an adjunct professor, a trustee and now as Board Chair, my commitment to MCNY’s mission of educating and empowering students to make constructive change is stronger than ever.

This PURPOSE drives us into the world, carrying out a mission of social justice, equity and equality. I have been known to say, “We do great work. Great work that transforms lives and our communities.” This 2022 Annual Report highlights the work of MCNY faculty, staff and students over the last year; I encourage you to celebrate the successes that you helped make possible.

As we look ahead, MCNY is working to transform to meet the needs of a changing workforce and vastly different higher education landscape post-pandemic. As you read through the Annual Report, we hope you will be inspired to continue this purposeful journey with us and invest in our students so that they, too, can work toward our shared mission for years to come.

Sincere regards, Sincere regards, Gary P. Jenkins Gary P. Jenkins  MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT   A Message from Joanne Passaro, PhD 2022 brought renewed vibrancy and energy to the MCNY community—and to our campuses—as we move past the pandemic. Students, faculty and staff continued to demonstrate resilience and dedication as they enthusiastically returned to campus for in-person events that reconnected us all as we worked towards our common goals. 2022 brought renewed vibrancy and energy to the MCNY community—and to our campuses—as we move past the pandemic. Students, faculty and staff continued to demonstrate resilience and dedication as they enthusiastically returned to campus for in-person events that reconnected us all as we worked towards our common goals. In June, our first in-person Commencement Ceremony since the pandemic, held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, was a joyous celebration of the power of Purpose-Centered Education. Two key members of the MCNY community were honored: alumnus and Chair of the Board Gary P. Jenkins and founding faculty member and outgoing MCNY trustee Thomas L. Webber. Their speeches were rousing calls to action to advance the work of our mission of social justice. Graduates and their families stood and roared their agreement; one graduate later told me that she “had goosebumps when they spoke. Their words were…the capstone of my MCNY degree.” If you didn’t have the opportunity to hear Gary and Tom in person, I highly recommend that you take the opportunity to do so.

Among the new initiatives highlighted in the 2022 report are these important programs: The Black Maternal Health Initiative (BMHI) was launched with grant funding from the American Library Association, with future growth supported by the TD Charitable Foundation for 2023. BMHI is a student and community engagement project that responds to the crisis of outcomes related to Black maternal health in the US, New York City, and most specifically, the Bronx. Key to the initiative are partnerships with Bronx-based community groups working in the field.

Key to the initiative are partnerships with Bronx-based community groups working in the field. A new Office for Career and Professional Development, led by Director Philip Meade and MCNY alumnus Coordinator Michael Goodwin, has increased its outreach to students and alums; worked with faculty and staff to embed career development into all academic programs; and expanded in-person and group workshops. A new platform, Handshake, now offers students and alums better ways to find meaningful jobs and build their professional networks.

A new platform, Handshake, now offers students and alums better ways to find meaningful jobs and build their professional networks. One important focus in 2022 was to continue strengthening students’ abilities to succeed in online and hybrid learning environments. With new tools and support, faculty and staff reported significant growth in students’ comfort and competence in online environments—this inspired faculty to plan for additional online course offerings, starting at the graduate level. In 2022, School for Business faculty developed the MBA in Healthcare Systems and Risk Management program for launch as an online program in fall 2023.

In the aftermath of the pandemic, adult students are looking for targeted, accelerated educational programs to meet their career advancement goals. MCNY has begun the exciting work of transforming its offerings to address existing and emerging needs of adult learners. We are developing new degree programs as well as new options for “stackable” credentials and certifications that students can access as needed for professional growth. These shorter-term credentials can be accumulated over time and become the basis of a degree program at a later date.

As we work towards realizing our mission in new ways, our connections with MCNY alums and friends will be more important than ever. We will reach out for your advice and support. The College will offer more on-campus events to strengthen our community and enrich alum connections and networks. We look forward to working with our alums and friends as we chart an exciting new path for expanding the reach of Purpose-Centered Education. Stay tuned!

Enrollment Options Classes Offered The Associate of Arts in Human Services program at Metropolitan College of New York is a degree that prepares students for entry-level roles in the helping professions. In modern society, it’s easy for many disadvantaged members of the community to fall through the cracks. Social workers and caseworkers do the work necessary to ensure that the most vulnerable people have access to the assistance they need. This program teaches students how to coordinate supporting activities, processes, and outcomes within community settings or organizations. Graduates typically go on to a variety of careers in counseling, child welfare, social work, education, fundraising, public service, foster care and eldercare. They also find meaningful careers in government, healthcare, health administration, ministry and human resources and probation. This degree is also rooted in the founding of the college. In 1964, educational pioneer Audrey Cohen began offering classes to students in New York City and developed a unique combination of theory and practical learning, which we call Purpose-Centered Education. Today, graduates continue to emerge as true practitioners in this field, prepared with the knowledge and skills to make an impact and contribute as front-line leaders and decision makers. This program is a powerful education in human services that students can only get from MCNY.

discrimination. MCNY prohibits discrimination or harassment by students, employees, or third parties against any person on the basis of race, color, sex, gender, pregnancy, religion, creed, marital status, partnership status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, disability, military status, or any other legally protected category in the admission to and administration of its educational programs or the employment of individuals in College administered programs and activities.

This law provides that the institution will maintain the confidentiality of student educational records. Personally identifiable information from a student’s education record will not be disclosed without consent of the student, except to other school officials within MCNY whom MCNY has determined to have a legitimate educational interest, and to others to the extent the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act authorizes disclosure without consent. A school official is a person employed by MCNY in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom MCNY has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agent); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the College also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. Directory Information Directory information refers to information contained in an education record of a student that generally would not be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. MCNY designates the following categories of student information as public or directory information. MCNY may disclose such information at its discretion, without the written consent of the student. Name Address Telephone numbers Email address Photograph Date of birth Enrollment status (including full or part time) Major field of study Grade level or purpose Dates of attendance Degrees received Honors and awards received Most recent education institution attended Student id number A currently enrolled student may request that his or her directory information not be released by filing an opt-out form with the office of the registrar. Students should be aware that opting out does not prevent the release of information to school officials as described above, nor does it prevent a school official from identifying a student by name or from disclosing a student’s institutional email address in class. Right to Inspect Records The College respects the rights of students to inspect and review their educational records, with the exception of financial information submitted by parents and confidential letters and recommendations associated with admissions, employment or job placement. Students who believe their educational records contain inaccurate or misleading information should contact the office of the registrar regarding the policy for correction of inaccurate data as mandated by this law and implemented by MCNY. Students should complete a Review of Records Form available at the office of the registrar. MCNY will honor the request to review records within a 30-day period from receipt of the request. Complaints Each student has the right to file a complaint with the family policy and compliance office (address below) of the Department of Education if the College has failed to comply with the requirements of the law. Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5901 Begin FERPA Tutorial Code of Conduct for Students  Code of Conduct for Students MCNY students are expected to comport themselves as adults, and to behave in a manner that facilitates the College’s mission. The College recognizes that freedom of inquiry and the transmission of knowledge are the foundations of higher learning. However, any assertion of rights or freedoms must be balanced by a readiness to assume corresponding responsibilities. These include respecting the rights of others in the academic community and accepting responsibility for one’s own behavior. Jurisdiction over student conduct and behavior of a nonacademic nature resides with the dean of students. Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Assault, Hazing, Disruptive and/or Illegal Conduct In the interest of protecting the rights of all individuals on campus, the College has established standards of conduct and policies and procedures prohibiting discrimination, harassment, sexual assault and other disruptive and or illegal conduct. Students must refrain from: Making any verbal or physical threats of violence, or behaving in a coercive, intimidating, hostile or threatening manner to students, faculty or staff. Bringing weapons on campus—firearms, box-cutters, knives, mace, or any instrument or device used for attack. Engaging in unprofessional and or illegal behavior or conduct, such as harassment, assault (see separate section on sexual harassment and sexual assault), falsifying official College documents, stealing, damaging personal or College property, using illegal substances, disrupting a class or activities in an area of the College’s premises, etc. Uploading or downloading copyrighted works—music, movies, software, video games and other copyrighted works—without authorization of the owners. This is a violation of federal copyright law. Viewing sexually explicit or other inappropriate websites on any of the College’s computers. Any behavior that interferes with the operation of the College or any situation that recklessly or intentionally endangers or threatens the mental or physical health of any individual, including but not limited to threats, coercion, harassment or acts of violence. While these items address major standards of conduct, it is not realistic to list every potential infraction; the College reserves the right to extend these principles to similar acts. Procedure for Nonacademic Conduct Violations Any member of the faculty, administration, staff or student body may file a complaint against a student for any offense by following the procedure below. Complaints must be filed within 30 days of the initial incident. While this procedure will suffice for reporting most offenses, students should review the special sections for reporting instances of sexual harassment, discrimination, hazing and sexual assaults.   Filing a Complaint A complaint must be filed, in writing, to the dean of students. It must be typed, or legibly written, dated, and signed (electronic signature is sufficient). The complaint must clearly describe the incident, including specific time and date of the occurrence and all persons involved. The College may suspend the subject(s) of the complaint immediately, pending an investigation and hearing, if there is a credible allegation of a threat of physical harm. Such suspension shall last no longer than 48 hours. If, after the investigation, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to indicate that allowing the subject(s) on campus presents a risk, the suspension will be extended pending a disciplinary hearing. In other cases, the dean of students may designate a representative to conduct an investigation into the allegation(s). The designated representative of the dean will notify the accused party and may schedule a fact-finding meeting to begin the investigation. As part of the fact-finding process, the accused may submit a written response to the allegations. During the fact-finding process, upon agreement of all parties, the dean of student’s designated representative may attempt mediation to informally resolve the issue. Sexual harassment claims shall not be subject to mediation directly between the parties but a mutually acceptable resolution may be facilitated by the representative of the dean of students. Sexual assault claims shall not be subject to mediation. If the issue is not resolved at this level, the designated representative of the dean of students will refer the complaint for a disciplinary hearing. Disciplinary Hearing and Due Process The dean of students will convene the conduct review board to hear the complaint. The board is comprised of two students, one faculty member, and one professional staff member, all of whom are impartial. The associate director of student services will chair the board but will not be a voting member. The accused and the complainant will be notified of the hearing, and will be requested to attend. If either or both parties choose not to attend, the College reserves the right to conduct the hearing in their absence. If it is determined that the accused poses a threat of physical harm, the board may request that the accused submit a written response to the allegations rather than attend the hearing in person. Hearings will be open only to individuals and witnesses who are invited by the board. The accused or complainant can request assistance for the hearing, subject to approval by the conduct review board. The board must be given at least 24 hours notice that the presence of such assistance is desired at the hearing. Individuals may not be accompanied by an attorney. The board will hear all testimony relevant to the complaint and will be allowed to ask questions of all parties and witnesses, if any. The accused and complainant will generally not be permitted to directly question each other during the hearing, and may be called before the board separately. The board may choose to record the hearing at its discretion. Upon completion of the hearing, the board will meet in private to deliberate and form a recommendation on its findings and applicable sanctions, if any. The recommendation and findings shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. This recommendation shall be submitted to the dean of students within two working days of the hearing. The board may recommend the dismissal of the allegations or the imposition of disciplinary sanctions, as noted below, which include suspension or dismissal from the College. Based on the board’s findings, the dean of students or her designee will make a decision on the complaint and determine the appropriate sanction(s) if any. The dean will notify the accused, in writing, of the decision and the right to appeal within 10 calendar days of the hearing. Notification will also be made to the victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence including forcible sex offenses, or a non-forcible sex offense (incest or statutory rape) concerning the final results of a disciplinary hearing (including any violation found to have been committed and sanctions imposed) with respect to the alleged crime, regardless of the outcome of the hearing. Notification may also be made to any third party regarding the final results of a disciplinary proceeding related to a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense, if the student who is the alleged perpetrator is found to have violated the College’s rules or policies. The disclosure of the final results will only include: the name of the alleged perpetrator, the violation committed, and any sanction imposed against the alleged perpetrator. The disclosure will not include the name of any other student including a victim or witness, without the written consent of that other student. The complainant in sexual harassment cases will be notified of any sanctions that relate directly to the complainant if sexual harassment is found to have occurred, for instance sanctions that the harasser avoid contact with the complainant or leave the College. Regardless of whether harassment is found to have occurred, both sides shall be given notice of the outcome and the right to appeal. The College is required by the Cleary Act to give the campus community timely warning of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees. Such information is exempt from FERPA under the exception of health or safety emergencies. The complainant and any individual who cooperates with an investigation will be protected against retaliation. Any acts of retaliation should be reported to the dean of students or other College administrator immediately and will be thoroughly investigated. Disciplinary Appeals Decisions made by the dean of students or her designee may be appealed, in writing, to the executive vice president for enrollment management within 14 calendar days of the date of the notification. Failure to submit an appeal within this period shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal. All appeals will be limited to a review of the original hearing, including any supporting documents. Appeals will be limited to: Determining whether the original hearing was conducted in a fair manner and in accordance with College policy. Determining whether the decision was based on a preponderance of the evidence. Determining whether the sanctions were appropriate for the violation of conduct. Consideration of new information that was not available at the time of the initial hearing. Disciplinary Sanction The sanctions imposed will be determined by the severity of the violation, prior misconduct and the student’s understanding and willingness to accept responsibility for the behavior. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following: Verbal and or written warning. Community and or College service. Behavioral contract. Monetary fines and or restitution. Social probation (suspension from a student club, group or activity). Suspension from attending classes or being on College premises. Dismissal. Discretionary sanctions, which may include notation in the student’s permanent file. The College reserves the right to combine sanctions, as appropriate. Any student who is suspended or dismissed will be responsible for tuition charges incurred, in accordance with the tuition liability policy. General Grievance Procedure Any student who has an issue or complaint against the College may request consideration under the general grievance procedure. This includes situations where the student feels the College policies and procedures do not comply with applicable laws, or where a College administrator, staff member, or faculty member is perceived as acting unfairly or improperly in carrying out assigned tasks or responsibilities. The general grievance procedure will apply to situations outside of the specific procedures outlined in this handbook for grade appeals, harassment complaints or disciplinary actions against students for misconduct. Students should also feel free to report incidents, whether or not they have decided to file a formal complaint. They may merely want to discuss an incident or matter, they may want to review ways to deal with the situation personally, or they may want information on how to file a formal complaint. Even if a student is undecided about whether or not to file a formal complaint, consultation may help in defining the problem and in exploring the options for solving it. The best avenue for such discussions is with an advisor in the office of student services. I. Informal Resolution Prior to initiating a formal complaint, it is generally recommended that the student first attempt to discuss the matter with the individual most directly responsible. This may be done verbally or in writing. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, or if there are circumstances that make direct contact inappropriate, the matter should be brought to the dean of students. The dean may also attempt to resolve the grievance informally. If there is no mutually acceptable informal resolution, if the resolution is inconclusive, or if either party is dissatisfied with the progress of the informal procedure, the dean of students will promptly to proceed to a formal review. II. Formal Complaint The student may file a formal complaint following the procedures below: A. When to File a Complaint Complaints must be filed in a timely manner, as soon as possible after the initial concern arose. B. Filing a Complaint All complaints must be submitted in writing and should include the following information: The grievant’s (student filing the complaint) name, current contact information (address, IQMail address and phone number). A full description of the problem, including: The name of the individual(s) about whom the complaint is being made. The names of any witnesses. Copies of any materials that may be relevant to the complaint. The name of the individual(s) about whom the complaint is being made. The names of any witnesses. Copies of any materials that may be relevant to the complaint. A summary of the efforts made (if any) to resolve the issue informally. A statement of the remedy requested by the grievant. C. Where to File a Complaint The complaint is to be filed with the dean of students at Metropolitan College of New York, 60 West Street, New York,  NY 10006. The dean of students’ office is located on the 6th floor. Email: cibarradillon@mcny.edu . D. Review and Investigation The dean of students will delegate the review of the student’s issue to the appropriate administrative office or official for prompt review and determination of required action. The review will generally be completed within 45 calendar days of receipt of the written statement. The investigating official will promptly initiate an impartial investigation. He or she may interview, consult with, and/or request a written response from any individual believed to have information relevant to the complaint. This includes all faculty, staff and students. E. Findings and Notification Once the formal review has been concluded, the investigating official will provide a determination based on the evidence provided. The investigating official shall provide a written response to the complaint to the complainant, with a copy to the dean of students within 45 calendar days of receipt of the grievance. The deadline may be extended by the dean of students for good cause, such as extended breaks in the academic calendar, (e.g., winter break) or unavailability of necessary parties. Complaints will be handled in a manner respectful to the confidentiality of the parties involved to the extent possible. Retaliation against any individual who brings a complaint or participates in the process is prohibited. Any concerns of retaliation should be reported to the dean of students immediately. Violation and Misuse of MCNY Identity and Logo The College’s name and logo are registered trademarks of Metropolitan College of New York and may not be used without the written permission from the College. Such permission will set forth the name of the group, the nature of the use, and restrictions regarding the standards and quality of the goods and services in connection with which the trademark(s) are used. Violation of this rule is regarded as sufficient cause for dismissal. New York State Immunization Laws  New York State Immunization Laws New York State Immunization Laws The New York State Public Health Law mandates that students residing in New York State and born on or after January 1, 1957, must provide the College with documentation of immunization for measles, mumps and rubella within 30 days of enrolling. Students from out of state or international students have 45 days from enrolling to provide acceptable documentation. The documentation consists of either of the following: Official blood test results confirming that you have been tested and you are immune to the above diseases. Arrangements for such blood tests are most easily made through your own physician, or, if you are part of a health maintenance organization, then through its services; or a statement or form signed by a health provider confirming that you have been immunized by vaccine for the above diseases. This confirmation must also include the dates of immunization, and show that one dose of the mumps and rubella vaccines and two doses of the measles vaccine were administered. Your healthcare provider or a City Health Department clinic can administer the immunizations and provide the appropriate documentation. In addition, if your employing company or organization has a medical office, you may be able to get your immunizations there. If you carry medical insurance or are part of a health maintenance organization, check to see if the costs for either the blood test or the immunizations are reimbursable or covered. There are public health clinics where immunization can be obtained without charge. However, clinics tend to be crowded, particularly prior to the start of the semesters at colleges all over New York State. New York State also requires colleges to notify all students of the dangers of meningitis an infection, which can lead to high fever, headache, vomiting and skin rash. It is easily spread through nose or throat discharges of an infected person. Vaccines are available from your health practitioner. MCNY is required to inform all students of the dangers of this disease and secure a signed statement from each student that they are aware of the dangers of this disease and understand that they may take steps to be properly immunized and thereby protect themselves from infection. Certain individuals are exempt from these new requirements including those who sign a statement indicating that they hold sincere religious beliefs, which prohibit such immunizations, and those with certain documented medical conditions—early pregnancy, for example. A physician’s confirming statement is required and should be attached to the medical form already provided. Medical forms are distributed to all students at the time of admission. These must be completed and returned to the appropriate office within 30 or 45 days of enrolling, and will become part of the student’s official record. A student who fails to comply with this law may be administratively withdrawn and will not be allowed to register for the subsequent semester. Additionally, the student’s financial aid may be negatively affected. Sexual Harassment Policy for Employees of MCNY  Sexual Harassment Policy for Employees of MCNY Sexual Harassment Policy It is illegal under federal, state and local laws for an employer to discriminate or harass any employee on the basis of sex. Metropolitan College of New York prohibits sexual harassment of any member of the College community, whether such harassment is aimed at students, faculty or other employees, and violators will be subject to disciplinary action. Sexual harassment may take many forms. Sexual assault and requests for sexual favors that affect educational or employment decisions constitute sexual harassment. However, sexual harassment may also consist of unwanted physical contact (including but not limited to patting, pinching or brushing against another’s body); requests for sexual favors (including but not limited to propositions, innuendo, “jokes” or suggestive comments, whether transmitted orally, in writing, or electronically); visual display or circulation of sexual images (including through email); sexually suggestive conduct, or offensive remarks of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature will constitute sexual harassment when: Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of any individual’s employment. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting that individual. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s academic or work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive academic or working environment. 1.2.1 Procedures for Reporting a Complaint of Harassment and/or Discrimination The College is committed to preventing sexual harassment and associated retaliatory behavior. All Metropolitan College of New York supervisors have a responsibility to act to stop harassment in the areas under their supervision. The College strongly urges the reporting of all incidents of sexual harassment and/or discrimination regardless of the offender’s identity or position. Individuals who believe they are being subjected to harassing or discriminatory conduct should promptly advise the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and request that it be discontinued. Individuals should then report the complaint, in writing, to the director of human Resources as soon as possible after the harassment has occurred. Individuals who have experienced conduct they believe is contrary to these policies have an obligation to take advantage of the College’s complaint procedure. Failure to fulfill this obligation may affect an individual’s rights in pursuing legal action. Early reporting and intervention have proved to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment and/or discrimination. Therefore, the College strongly urges the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so that rapid action may be taken. 1.2.2 Investigation The College will conduct a thorough and impartial investigation once a complaint of harassment or discrimination is made. Notice of the complaint shall be given to the subjects of the complaint at the appropriate time. The subject(s) of the complaint shall be afforded an opportunity to present their own version of the events and any information they wish to offer in their defense. Both the complainant and the accused will be given written notice of the results of the investigation. All employees and students are required to fully cooperate in the investigation of harassment and discrimination complaints. All complaints will be taken seriously and will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Complaints will be treated as confidential matters and only those persons necessary for the investigation will be involved in the process. 1.2.3 Corrective Action If it is concluded that harassment and/or discrimination did occur, the College will take immediate appropriate corrective action. Corrective action may include, by way of examples, training, referral to counseling, and/or disciplinary action, such as warning, reprimand, withholding of a promotion or pay increase, reassignment, temporary suspension with or without pay, demotion or termination. Employees who in good faith make a complaint under this policy, or who cooperate with an investigation into possible harassment or discrimination, will be protected against adverse employment actions or retaliation for such complaint or cooperation. Follow-up interviews with the complainant will be conducted for an appropriate period of time to ensure that the harassment has not resumed and that no retaliatory action has been taken. 1.3 Policy on Other Types of Harassment and Discrimination Just as sexual harassment is strictly prohibited, so is harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, or any other category protected by law. The College will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of applicants, employees or students by anyone, including managers, supervisors, coworkers or students. Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual that is based upon a person’s protected status including those listed above. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to, epithets, slurs or negative circulation of written or graphic material (including through email) that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group. The College will not tolerate harassing conduct or discrimination that affects tangible job benefits, interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Employees who observe or feel that they have been subject to such conduct should notify the College by following the procedures outlined in Section 1.2.1. If you have any questions concerning the College’s policy on harassment and discrimination, or other equal employment opportunity matters, please feel free to contact the Director of Human Resources. Title IX - Commitment to Students and Diversity  Title IX - Commitment to Students and Diversity Notice of Nondiscrimination MCNY is committed to providing a learning and working environment not impaired by unlawful discrimination. MCNY prohibits discrimination or harassment by students, employees, or third parties against any person on the basis of race, color, sex, gender, pregnancy, religion, creed, marital status, partnership status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, disability, military status, or any other legally protected category in the admission to and administration of its educational programs or the employment of individuals in College administered programs and activities. Sexual harassment and sexual violence are forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”). Consistent with Title IX and other federal, state and local laws, including Article 129-B of the New York State Education Law, and MCNY policy, the College is committed to maintaining a community that prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, and gender-based misconduct. For College procedures and resources regarding sexual and gender-based misconduct click here . As stated above, and consistent with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) the College does not discriminate on the basis of disability in the admission or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and activities. Inquiries regarding the application of Section 504 and its implementing regulation may be referred to the Section 504 Coordinator named below or to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. The College’s 504 Coordinator is responsible for the coordination of compliance with all aspects of Section 504.

These procedures apply to discriminatory and harassing conduct carried out by employees, students, and third parties. All College staff members who observe potentially discriminatory or harassing conduct should intervene where it is possible and safe to do so and promptly report the incident to the College’s 504 Coordinator. The College reserves the right to reasonably extend any timeframe outlined below as may be necessary given the facts of the case, the parties involved, and academic calendar. Reporting Misconduct Anyone who feels that he or she has experienced or witnessed harassment or discrimination by a student, employee, or third party may file a written complaint with the College’s 504 Coordinator either in person or by email. The College’s 504 Coordinator is named below and can be reached at: Clotilde Ibarra Dillon Dean of Students Title IX Coordinator/504 Coordinator Metropolitan College of New York 60 West Street New York, NY 10006 (212) 343-1234; cibarradillon@mcny.edu Investigation Upon receipt of a complaint of harassment and/or discrimination the 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will initiate an investigation. An investigation will consist of meeting with the complainant and anyone else the complainant identifies as having relevant information. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will also meet with the person alleged to have committed the harassment or discrimination. Both the complainant and the respondent will have the opportunity to submit evidence and information as well as identify witnesses. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will explain to each party separately their rights under this and other relevant College policies as well as discuss the supportive resources and interim measures available. An investigation will generally be completed within 20 business days of receipt of a complaint. The 504 Coordinator, or her designee, will complete an Investigation Report generally within 10 business days of the close of an investigation. That Report will be maintained in the 504 Coordinator’s Office. Interim Measures The College may implement interim measures to protect the safety and well-being of those who report or experience discrimination/harassment, as well as those who have been accused of such conduct. Interim measures may include, and will depend on the availability of College resources, the nature and severity of the allegations, and the parties involved: changes in class schedules, changes in work assignments/supervisors, academic support, and/or temporary no-contact orders. The College is able to refer those involved in a harassment or discrimination complaint to a variety of community-based counseling and support resources. For more information about the resources that exist any individual (student, employee, visitor) may contact the 504 Coordinator or the Dean of Students’ Office. Resolution The Investigation Report will be forwarded to an appropriate and impartial administrative officer for consideration and determination as to whether harassment or discrimination occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence. The parties will be notified in writing of the College’s determination. Generally, a determination will be completed within 14 business days of the administrative officer’s receipt of the Investigation Report, but may take a reasonably longer period of time depending on the facts, the availability of the parities, the College’s academic calendar, complexity of the case, and other factors specific to each case. The administrative officer’s final determination may contain a recommended sanction depending on the nature of the findings. Remedies/Sanctions Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, training, written warnings, suspension, and expulsion/termination from the College. The College may take additional steps to address discriminatory effects of the misconduct and to prevent recurrence. Such steps will depend on the nature and extent of the discrimination or harassment, but may include mandatory training/counseling for the perpetrator of the misconduct, campus-wide or targeted trainings, campus outreach, and/or reasonable academic/emotional support for those affected by the misconduct. Appeal Either party may appeal the administrative officer’s decision within 10 business days of notification of the College’s determination. The appeal must be made in writing to the Appeal Officer designated by the College in its determination letter. Appeals will be limited to circumstances where a party makes a compelling argument that: (1) there was a procedural error in the investigation or hearing of the complaint, and/or (2) relevant evidence has become available that was not available during the investigation or hearing. Appeals will be conducted in an impartial manner by an impartial Appeal Officer. The decision of the Appeal Officer is final and will be delivered to both parties within 10 business days of receipt of the appeal. Retaliation The College strictly prohibits any form of retaliation, intimidation, or reprisal for making a complaint of harassment or discrimination or otherwise participating in the investigation and resolution process. Anyone who experiences or witnesses retaliation should inform the 504 Coordinator immediately. Any person found to have committed an act of retaliation, intimidation, or reprisal will be subject to disciplinary action, which could result in suspension or expulsion/termination from the College.

Image March 3, 2025 – Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) is honored and grateful to announce the continuation of the “Bert Breiner Memorial Scholarship,” established in 2023 in memory of the late Reverend Dr. Bert Breiner , former MCNY Adjunct Professor of Ethics. Funding for the scholarship is supported by Friends of Bert Breiner. The “Bert Breiner Memorial Scholarship” is earmarked for eligible undergraduate students in the Human Services and for MPA students. Eligible students are those with outstanding performance throughout the term of study who need financial support to help ensure the completion of their degree. The selection of students will be determined by the MCNY Scholarship Committee and awarded in the Spring, Summer and Fall 2025 semesters. His love and talent for teaching were expressed in a review of his classes by one of his students, “Professor Breiner is hands down one of the nicest, most genuine and passio nate persons I have ever met. This class and professor hold a special place in my heart.” About the Late Bert Breiner (July 20, 1948 – May 27, 2023) For many years, the Reverend Dr. Bert Breiner taught ethics and related subjects at the Bronx campus of Audrey Cohen College, now Metropolitan College of New York . He emphasized the importance of language, culture and constructive relationships in his teaching. Dr. Breiner was also a scholar of Abrahamic faiths. He was a priest in the Diocese of New York and died peacefully on May 27, 2023. He served many years at Christ and St. Stephen’s church on Manhattan’s Upper Westside. Accompanied by his wife Margaret, he served as a deacon at St. Martin in the Fields parish in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, PA. After becoming ordained, he taught seminarians in Malaysia (1973-1976) and at the Selly Oak Colleges in Birmingham, UK (1976-1995). He was also an associate of the Society of St. Margaret. On return to the United States in 1995, Bert served as co-director of interfaith relations at the National Council of Churches. Shortly before 9/11, he served as chaplain at Grace Church School in Manhattan. At the invitation of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Abrams, he worked for peace in New York City by facilitating dialogue between local rabbis and imams. Over the years, he taught courses in religion at St. Francis College, Hartford Seminary and General Seminary; he also taught religion courses for many years at CUNY’s Hunter College. 2025-03-06T14:17:43-05:00 Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

Undergraduate Admission Undergraduate Admission 2025-04-21T21:57:06-04:00 What you should know  Before you apply to MCNY, review what’s required to be considered for admission to one of our undergraduate programs . A completed application for admission.  A completed application for admission. Official high school transcript.  Transfer Students: Official college transcripts from all schools attended.  An admissions interview will follow and it will be determined if you will be required to sit for MCNY’s entrance exam. The determination will be made on one of the following: High school grade point average (GPA).  High school grade point average (GPA). GED Scores.  GED Scores. SAT scores if you are a recent high school graduate. (The CEEB code for MCNY is 2157). Test must have been taken within the past five years.  If you are a transfer student and have proof that you completed a college-level English and Mathematics course with a grade of “C” or better.  Receive College Credit at MCNY for Prior Learning and/or Experiences. CLICK FOR DETAILS  CLICK FOR DETAILS Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) embraces the premise that college-level learning can occur both in and out of the classroom, from employment or career training, to community and personal experience. Many adult students who come to MCNY do so with specific knowledge and experience that may correspond to college-level courses. Prior learning assessment (p.l.a.) gives students the opportunity to earn credits by applying their prior life experience towards a college degree in one of the college’s three schools – the Audrey Cohen School for Human Services and Education (ACSHSE), the School for Business (SB), and the School for Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA). P.L.A. credits only apply to undergraduate degree programs and are not guaranteed. Students must apply for p.l.a. and be approved by a school’s dean or a program’s director upon enrollment. Once approved, students will be exempt from taking the specific required course(s) for which credit has been awarded. The number of credits awarded will depend on the degree program, the number of credits transferred, the extent of a student’s life experience, and the quality and thoroughness of the portfolio that a student submits for consideration. A bachelor’s degree candidate who has transferred 90 credits is not eligible for this program. A student entering an associate’s degree program can earn up to six credits upon enrollment, if qualified. A student entering a bachelor’s degree program can earn up to nine credits upon enrollment, if qualified. If a student is awarded p.l.a. credits, he or she may apply for advanced standing in certain programs (see the college’s Student Handbook) but will be limited to 30 credits and will be required to pay additional fees. There will be no duplication of credits awarded. Is PLA Right for You? If you answer “yes” to many of the following questions, p.l.a. is right for you. Do you have five years of full-time experience in your field of study? Did you obtain this full-time experience within the past ten years? Is your previous work experience related to specific courses for which you are seeking credit? Are you an active member or veteran of the military? Have you earned college-level credits that can be transferred towards an undergraduate degree at MCNY? Have you provided official transcripts of previously earned credits for evaluation? Have you earned credits for college-level writing courses? Do you hold certifications, licenses, training, or workplace or industry credentials that might be applicable to college-level coursework? Have you completed any noncredit or open courses? Do you have any expertise that has qualified you to teach credit-bearing college courses? Do you engage in any volunteer work for which credit might be earned? Do you have at least five years of formal or informal part-time or full-time work experience? Are you able to produce evidence of learning (letters of support, samples of work, training certifications)? Do you hold professional certifications, examinations, CLEP, DSST, UExcel? How to Apply: New Students Only Deadline for submitting application portfolio: Submissions are due upon application for admission to the college or prior to enrolling for the first term of study in an undergraduate program. The student who applies for p.l.a. credits is required to submit a portfolio with his or her application for admission to the college. This portfolio must document the student’s previous experience within the field and demonstrate how the experience directly relates to the program of study by aligning previous learning with courses’ learning objectives and outcomes. This portfolio can include professional certifications, examinations, CLEP, DSST, UExcel or military experience. The student will assume responsibility for the completeness and thoroughness of the portfolio. Incomplete portfolios will not be evaluated. The portfolio must include documentation that learning took place. While portfolios may vary based on a program and a student’s experience, they must meet the following requirements: In the portfolio, the student will need to provide a learning autobiography that demonstrates to the evaluator that learning occurred through significant personal and professional activities and events. The portfolio must include self-assessment, relevance to a course or Purpose, preparation, presentation, and documentation. Specific documents that should be included are letters of support, certificates, licenses, CLEP, DSST, UExcel or evidence of military experience, and evaluations in support of a claim of learning and knowledge reflective of a course’s learning objectives. The portfolio must include two letters of reference from supervisors or directors familiar with the student’s skills and performance in the field for which he or she is seeking exemption. These letters must be on company letterhead and signed. These references should state the student’s years of experience, describe the student’s strengths, provide examples of how the student performed his or her job, and list the student’s training. state the student’s years of experience, describe the student’s strengths, provide examples of how the student performed his or her job, and list the student’s training. The portfolio should be prepared according to the standards detailed in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (also known as “APA style”). The portfolio will be evaluated by a school’s dean or a program’s director. If it is determined that the student’s knowledge of a subject is at the undergraduate level and deserving of a grade of C or better, credit will be awarded. If this is not the case, credit will be not be awarded, and the student will need to enroll in the appropriate courses. Fee for Assessment of Prior Learning The college will charge the student a non-refundable assessment fee of $150 for every course ($150/course) for which credit for prior learning is requested.

Students applying for federal student loans must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). M Deferment and Enrollment Verification Enrollment verification is necessary for deferral of loan repayment during a student’s ongoing course of study. You may request enrollment verification online through the National Student Clearinghouse or contact the Office of the Registrar . Please consult with your lender, guarantee agency or servicer to determine whether they require a Loan Deferment Request Form to be filed every semester or if a single request form is sufficient for the duration of your in-school enrollment. If you are seeking to defer loan repayment for reasons other than ongoing in-school enrollment (due to economic hardship, for example), you must contact the lender or loan servicer for information about available options.

A PLUS loan must be repaid and it is the responsibility of parents to make these payments. Both the student and parent must complete the FAFSA using school code 009769 . The parent must submit a PLUS loan promissory note (MPN) online at studentloans.gov, indicating the amount requested. By submitting the application, you are consenting to a financial credit check and permitting the Department of Education to inform MCNY of the results. Our federal school code for loans is 009769 . Graduate Federal PLUS Loan  Graduate Federal PLUS Loan Graduate and professional degree students who are enrolled at least half time are eligible up to their cost of attendance, minus other estimated financial assistance. Students are required to have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Direct Student Loan Program before applying for a graduate/professional PLUS loan.

Repayment and Deferment  Repayment and Deferment You can find important information about repayment rights and responsibilities, grace periods, managing your debt, and tracking your loan at studentloans.gov . Private Student Loans  Private Student Loans Private educational student loans can help bridge the gap between financial aid and the total cost of education. As with many private student loans, the student is the primary borrower. However, most students will require a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer (does not have to be a parent). We recommend that students first apply for financial aid and borrow with federal student loans. If additional financing is needed, alternative students loans can be an option. Students may choose to use any eligible lender that offers private education loans. MCNY does not maintain a list of lenders that offer private education loans, nor will we endorse a particular lender. Students who need a focused resource to assist in finding a private loan may choose to use the list of private loan options developed by FinAid .

Dear MCNY Community, I write to share bittersweet news—our esteemed Dean, Clotilde Ibarra, has shared with me her intent to retire at the end of this month. For more than six years, Dean Ibarra has been an unwavering advocate for our students and a driving force in our community. Her leadership, dedication, and compassion have made an immeasurable impact on MCNY. Dean Ibarra has worn many hats during her tenure, each with the same level of care and commitment. Recently stepping in as Interim Vice President of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs, she worked tirelessly to support student success and was instrumental in selecting and onboarding our new Vice President of Enrollment Management and Student Affairs, Dr. Hamilton Raymond. Dean Ibarra played a pivotal role in navigating the challenges of the pandemic, serving as the point person for COVID-19 protocols while helping to transition the college to online instruction. Dean Ibarra’s impact on Student Affairs and the lives she has touched will not be forgotten. She has mentored and nurtured countless students and staff, and she has been an integral part of making Commencement Day the unforgettable celebration it is. I am truly appreciative of Dean Ibarra, as she has been nothing short of amazing in support and leadership since the beginning of my administration. During this time of transition, I have asked Dr. Hamilton Raymond to lead the search for a permanent placement for a candidate to lead the area of Student Affairs in the future. I want to thank the entire team in Student Affairs that continues to demonstrate excellence in moving our college forward and being the front-line responders to the many needs of our students. Please join me in thanking Dean Ibarra for her incredible leadership, her boundless compassion, and her unwavering commitment to MCNY. She will be deeply missed, but her legacy will live on in the countless lives she has touched. Please join me in congratulating Dean on reaching this milestone and the next chapter of her life, which, by the way, will include much-desired time to spend with her grandbabies.

decision and can feel overwhelming, so we want to make the next steps in your process easy. Follow these steps after you receive your acceptance letter. 1 1 Review Your Acceptance Letter Make sure you are admitted for the right program and the semester you selected. If you recently spoke with your admissions counselor about starting in a different semester, they will be able to produce a new letter for you. This is especially important for international students. 2 2 Provide Any Missing Documentation Log in to your admissions portal to a list of what we still need. There might be additional forms or documentation you’ll need to provide. You’ll also receive this link in your acceptance letter. 3 3 Complete the Financial Aid Process If you are eligible to file the FAFSA, then you should complete these steps to ensure your financial aid package can be generated. Our financial aid counselors will prepare your award letter as soon as they have all of your information on file. If you need help, just contact your financial aid counselor . International students cannot apply for federal or state aid. 4 4 Speak with Your Academic Advisor Attend an upcoming registration event , or make an appointment with your academic advisor to go over course offerings and lock in your schedule. They will also help you schedule your date and time for New Student Orientation, and make sure you have everything ready to sign up for class. 5 5 Understand Your Payment Options The Bursar’s Office is where tuition bills are generated. They will help you find out how much is owed each semester and will arrange payment plans. They also process refunds and employer reimbursements. If you have a question about a bill, contact the Bursar’s Office . 6 6 Attend New Student Orientation Orientation is required for all new students. This is where you’ll learn about important campus resources, find out how to use Moodle, and find out more about the support we have for students in your specific academic program. Go ahead, sign up ! 7 7 Get Ready to Begin Class! Our entire enrollment team is focused on your success and you’ve come so far – now’s your chance to begin your program! Make sure you ask any remaining questions before starting class, and remember to add the dates and times of your classes to your calendar.

out of the idealism and turbulence of the 1960s, Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) was founded by Audrey Cohen, an innovative educator who believed the key to a truly effective education lay in uniting the classroom with the professional world. 1964 1964 Audrey Cohen launched the Women’s Talent Corps in 1964, addressing a need for both jobs and training. The program prepared motivated women, with experience in their low-income neighborhoods, for jobs to assist their communities. Simultaneously, the Women’s Talent Corps worked to create a new level of “paraprofessional” positions in organizations and agencies: teacher’s assistant, guidance counselor assistant, paralegal. The 30-week training program included an eight-week classroom orientation, 10 weeks on-the-job training in a school or community agency, and 12 weeks of intensive work at the same organization. Students were then hired by those agencies. The one-year training program paid students $2 per hour to participate. 1969 1969 By 1969, the Women’s Talent Corps began admitting men and added a second year of programming. It continued to expand in scope, and was renamed the College for Human Services in 1970, when it was granted a Charter by the New York State Board of Regents to award associate degrees, soon after it was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. 1972 1972 In 1972, the College revamped its curriculum to develop what it now calls Purpose-Centered Education. Interviewing a spectrum of the best professionals, they identified key characteristics that all shared no matter what their field or position. Among them were the ability to understand themselves and others, work effectively in groups, gather and communicate information, and manage change. Developing these skills became the foundation of Purpose-Centered Education , still the hallmark of MCNY and one of the differentiating factors of the college. This unique, holistic approach has proven to be particularly meaningful for nontraditional students pursuing degrees while working and raising families, as they can experience the relevance of their studies to their daily lives from the moment they enter the College. 1983 1983 Focused on human services professions in its early years, the College added business programs in 1983. Soon after, in 1988, the College added its first graduate program : a Master of Administration (today a Master of Public Administration ). 1992 1992 Renamed Audrey Cohen College in 1992 in honor of its founder and president, the school became Metropolitan College of New York a decade later, reflecting the growth, vitality and diversity that this dynamic institution shares with the city in which it is located. Students now come from all over the U.S. and the world, drawn to MCNY by its unique experiential focus, hands-on faculty, and opportunities for intense, accelerated study. Today Today Today, the college has graduate and undergraduate programs across three schools: the Audrey Cohen School for Human Services and Education , the School for Business and the School for Public Affairs and Administration .

Student Complaint Process NC-SARA Student Complaint Process 2024-09-12T17:18:03-04:00 The National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) Student Complaint Process  MCNY General Grievance Procedure  A student who has an issue or complaint against the College may request consideration of the matter under the general grievance procedure. Included might be situations where the student feels the College policies and procedures do not comply with applicable laws, or where a College administrator, staff member or faculty member is perceived as acting unfairly or improperly in carrying out assigned tasks or responsibilities. To request consideration under the general grievance procedure, a student should consult with an Advisor in the Student Services area, and/or the appropriate Director, Chair or Dean, to determine how best to resolve the issue informally. Most grievances are resolved at this stage. If the matter is not resolved informally, the student should present a written statement explaining the grievance to the Dean of Students. He or she will delegate the review of the student’s issue to the appropriate administrative office or official for prompt review and determination of required action. The review process will generally be completed within 45 calendar days of receipt of the written statement. Should the matter remain unresolved after the review process initiated by the Dean of Students, it may be appealed in writing to the VP of Enrollment Management and Student Affairs or the VP of Academic Affairs. He or she will delegate the review on appeal to an appropriate College administrator or faculty member for a final determination. Their decision is final. If an issue cannot be resolved internally, a student can file a complaint with the New York State Education Department (NYSED). Here is a link to NYSED’s complaint procedures ( http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/filing-complaint-about-college-or-university ).  Online Students Enrolled in New York Programs   Students taking distance education courses at Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) should resolve any issues or complaints with the College first, in accordance with the Grievance Procedure outline below. If an issue cannot be resolved internally, a student can file a complaint with the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and can follow the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (NC-SARA) complaint process. Below are more details. SARA – the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement – provides a streamlined, reciprocity-based process for participating postsecondary institutions to gain approval to offer interstate distance education in SARA member state without individually applying to each state for such approval, subject to certain limitations.* As such, students who are enrolled in online programs, and who have a complaint that is not resolved internally, may turn to the SARA State Portal Entity. Students must first direct their complaint to Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) for investigation and resolution. If the complaint remains unresolved after all institutional procedures have been exhausted, complaints may be directed to the SARA State Portal Entity through the New York State Education Department (NYSED) website ( http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/filing-complaint-about-college-or-university ). Students have two years from the date of the incident about which the complaint is made to appeal to the SARA State Portal Entity. Student complaints about grades or student conduct may not be filed to the SARA State Portal Entity. Complaints about fraud or criminal activity under SARA may be sent to the State Attorney General or the State Education Department. Here is the link to the NC-SARA complaint process ( https://www.nc-sara.org/student-complaints ). *SARA Policy Manual, June 27, 2022; Version 22.1 Disclosures Clery Report Clery Report  Privacy Policy Privacy Policy  Acceptable Use Policy Acceptable Use Policy  Title IX – Sex Discrimination and Reporting Sexual Misconduct Title IX – Sex Discrimination and Reporting Sexual Misconduct  Students’ Bill of Rights Students’ Bill of Rights  MCNY Sexual Harassment/Sexual Violence Climate Survey MCNY Sexual Harassment/Sexual Violence Climate Survey  NC-SARA Student Complaint Process NC-SARA Student Complaint Process  1-800-33-THINK MANHATTAN 60 West Street New York, NY 10006 (212) 343-1234 BRONX 463 E 149th St., Bronx, NY 10455 (718) 665-7787 Information About MCNY Human Resources Contact Us Resources Moodle Self-Service MCNY Email Student Resources Disclosures Consumer Information Title IX – Sexual Misconduct FERPA Emergency Procedures Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Go to Top

A: Please log into your account to opt-out for e2Campus alerts for your school. Q: What exactly is the MCNY Campus Alert System? A: The MCNY Campus Alert System is based on e2Campus by Omnilert. The e2Campus product is a patent pending universal notification system that allows designated administrators to send time-sensitive messages to the mobile phones, email, and/or pagers of their subscribers (students, faculty, staff, radio stations, TV stations, and others). In the event of an emergency, subscribers can get notified immediately of the situation, wherever they are geographically. Q: What is a universal notification system? A: A universal notification system is defined as a platform to deliver a notification to an entire audience by all means necessary; therefore creating universal coverage to increase the odds that a particular subscriber received the notification in a timely manner.

All you need is a web browser with an Internet connection and you are up and running! You can look at e2Campus as a Public Safety "Utility"- always on and ready for action. Q: Will any person receive unsolicited messages ("SPAM") on their mobile phone? A: NO. e2Campus enforces a ZERO SPAM policy which clearly prohibits unsolicited messages, and e2Campus does not sell the contact information of our subscribers to third party marketers. Q: People can text me however I cannot receive a message from e2Campus A: There are two types of text messaging: Mobile Originated (sending a text message from one phone to another) Mobile Terminated (a non-cellphone to a cell phone) Mobile Originated (sending a text message from one phone to another) Mobile Terminated (a non-cellphone to a cell phone) You may be able to receive Mobile-to-mobile messaging however it appears that mobile terminated messaging is not activated on your account.

Employees View Larger Image Starting next year, in partnership with Metropolitan College of New York , through the Education Propelling Into Careers @ MCNY program , DCAS employees will be able to obtain a High School Equivalency diploma and 27 college credits through an innovative new pilot program. The program builds on DCAS’ ongoing efforts to support staff through professional development opportunities NEW YORK – December 17, 2024 – Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) Commissioner Louis A. Molina and Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) President Dr. Charles Gibbs announced the launch of a groundbreaking new pilot program for DCAS staff, offering current DCAS employees the chance to earn their high school equivalency along with 27 college credits over the course of three semesters. The EPIC @ MCNY program marks a first-of-its-kind partnership with MCNY, utilizing the college’s existing Pathways to Careers program which is designed to support career growth and educational advancement for agency staff, with the potential to expand to more agencies citywide. “Education opens doors, and with this new initiative, we are achieving a major milestone for our agency, for our staff’s individual growth, and in the end, for stronger communities and a more resilient workforce,” said DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina . “Through this new EPIC program, we are turning something that is often taken for granted and instead using it to empower, making a strategic investment in our employees by equipping them with the knowledge and skills that drive retention and advancement. I’m proud that DCAS is leading this initiative to make educational attainment more accessible for all of our staff.” “Metropolitan College of New York is proud to partner with DCAS on this transformative initiative to empower municipal employees through our established Pathways To Careers (PTC) HSE program,” said Dr. Charles J. Gibbs, President of MCNY . “This program goes beyond providing high school equivalency; it offers a meaningful pathway to college credits and career advancement, addressing both pers onal and professional growth. We’re excited to welcome DCAS staff to our PTC program and to support their journey toward academic and career achievement. Together, we are fostering a stronger, more skilled workforce for New York City.” The EPIC program was initiated to address the educational needs of city employees and improve their long-term career prospects. Recent data revealed that approximately 50 DCAS employees currently lack a high school diploma or equivalent, a figure that highlights the importance of accessible, supportive educational pathways within the City’s workforce. Following a preparatory period and an entry test in December 2024, classes will commence in January 2025, with the cohort expected to complete their studies by January 2026. Staff participating in the EPIC @ MCNY program will spend one full workday a week at class under live instruction on campus at MCNY, which will count as a regular workday fully supported by DCAS. Program Highlights: In-person Instruction: Classes will be held in-person at MCNY’s 60 West Street campus in lower Manhattan. Over three semesters, participants will engage in courses designed for working professionals, covering topics such as Public Speaking, Ethics, American Gove rnment, and Critical Thinking. High School Equivalency Diploma: Upon successful completion of the program, participants will be eligible to receive their high school equivalency diploma. College Credits: Upon completion of the program, graduates will be equipped with 27 transferrable college credits, which may be utilized towards an associate or bachelor’s degree at MCNY. In addition to academic instruction, MCNY will provide a full range of support services, including tutoring, social work support, and access to a food pantry, to ensure participants have the resources needed to succeed. DCAS will maintain regular check-ins with participants, offering encouragement and celebrating milestones along the way. The launch of the EPIC program is the latest in DCAS’ extensive efforts to help the City’s workforce grow and learn. In September 2024, DCAS launched NYCityLearn , a dynamic new platform to administer comprehensive training programs and learning opportunities, ensuring the continuous growth and development of the City’s workforce. Easily accessible online, the system has streamlined the process for employees to register for classes, access their training transcripts, and explore a robust catalog of open enrollment trainings and eLearning modules—available anytime, anywhere. This launch reflected the City of New York’s ongoing commitment to delivering a more dynamic, customized, and transparent learning environment for all City employees. NYCityLearn, and now the HSE Program, are key components of Mayor Adams’ vision for a workforce that is continually growing, equipped with the tools and knowledge necessary to serve New Yorkers effectively. From the new EPIC program to the dozens of fellowship and internship programs offered by the City of New York to the latest bridge exam for public safety , all of these efforts build on the Adams Administration’s efforts to expand municipal work to more New Yorkers than ever before. In April, Mayor Adams launched “Run This Town,” a $1 million multi-media advertising campaign to engage diverse New Yorkers and help them apply for thousands of available city government jobs. The “Run This Town” campaign was preceded by the launch of “ Jobs NYC ,” a multi-pronged citywide effort to reduce barriers to economic opportunities and deliver workforce development services directly to communities across the five boroughs that are experiencing high unemployment. In September 2024, the administration announced that as part of Jobs NYC, 8,500 New Yorkers had been connected to jobs and free training resources at 26 hiring halls over six months in neighborhoods with the highest unemployment rate.

Image January 8, 2025 Dear Members of the MCNY Community, It is with great enthusiasm that I announce and welcome Dr. Hamilton Raymond as the new Vice President for Enrollment Management & Student Affairs at Metropolitan College of New York. I would like to take a moment to say thank you, Dean of Students Clotilde Ibarra, for stepping in as Interim and managing this significant responsibility with outstanding dedication and excellence. Your leadership and commitment have been truly inspiring and deeply appreciated. Dr. Hamilton Raymond joins us as a distinguished leader in higher education, bringing with him a wealth of experience, innovation, and a commitment to fostering inclusivity and expanding opportunities for underserved communities. A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Raymond brings over 15 years of exceptional experience in higher education leadership most recently having served as Chief Admissions Officer and Executive Director of Admissions at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania. His journey began in Brooklyn at Medgar Evers College, where he served as Assistant Director of Admissions, followed by his role at Brooklyn College as the Director of Student Life. He then took on the position of Director of Admissions and Enrollment at Johnson C. Smith University. Dr. Raymond is a trailblazer in higher education management with a proven track record of developing innovative programs to enhance the student experience while addressing the evolving needs of diverse populations and fostering access, equity, and success in higher education. Notably, Dr. Raymond’s passion for closing the enrollment gap for young men of color has been the cornerstone of his career. He has championed initiatives such as EmpowerMENt, which not only recruits young male students of color but also empowers them to thrive academically and personally. Dr. Raymond’s visionary perspective and hands-on leadership style make him a dynamic addition to the MCNY community. His ability to develop transformative strategies to increase student enrollment and retention aligns with our current challenges and his leadership will undoubtedly strengthen our efforts to provide opportunities for student success. Dr. Raymond holds a Bachelor of Science in Sociology from Buffalo State College, a Master of Science in Educational Psychology from Long Island University, and a Doctor of Education from Walden University. He is excited to return to his roots in the New York area, where he resides in New Jersey with his wife, Jocelyn, and their three children. As we look forward to this new chapter, I am confident that Dr. Raymond’s expertise and dedication will lead to meaningful collaborations among our leadership, staff and faculty advance our mission of transforming lives through education and embracing the great opportunities that lie ahead. Please join me in extending a warm MCNY welcome to Dr. Hamilton Raymond as he starts the new year in a new chapter with us. Sincerely, Dr. Charles J.

Global Education in Emergency and Disaster Management View Larger Image New York, NY 12/17/24 — Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) and Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas – ESPE have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish a partnership aimed at fostering global collaboration in education, research, and professional development. The agreement was signed by Col. C.S.M. Víctor Emilio Villavicencio Álvarez, Ph.D., Rector of ESPE, and Charles J. Gibbs, Ed.D., President of MCNY in the presence of the honorable Consulate General,  José Sandoval. This landmark partnership will create meaningful opportunities for students, faculty, and administrative staff from both institutions through initiatives such as academic mobility programs, research collaborations, and joint events including conferences and symposia. The MOU represents a commitment to mutual growth and cultural exchange, strengthening the global perspective of emergency and disaster management education. MCNY President Dr. Charles J. Gibbs emphasized the significance of this collaboration, stating “Sharing knowledge and expertise across borders is essential in today’s interconnected world, especially in fields like emergency management, where global challenges require collective solutions. This partnership reflects MCNY’s mission of Purpose-Centered Education, ensuring that our students and faculty engage in transformative experiences that prepare them to lead and serve globally.” MCNY Emergency and Disaster Management Students and Faculty Field Study trip, Ecuador 2019 MCNY , as one of the leading institutions, serves as a blueprint for the nation’s top Emergency Management programs , offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees in this critical field. The MPA in Emergency and Disaster Management , launched in 2002 , continues to educate Emergency Managers who lead city, state, and national agencies , as well as nonprofit organizations and businesses, toward safety and preparedness. Ali Gheith, CEM, MEO, ISO , Program Director of the Emergency and Disaster Management Programs at MCNY, highlighted the importance of the relationship, “This collaboration with ESPE is an exciting milestone for MCNY’s Emergency Management Programs. It allows us to build strong academic and cultural bridges while expanding the reach and impact of our work.

With climate change exacerbating extreme weather events and increasing vulnerabilities, emergency managers must adapt by leveraging innovative technologies, data-driven strategies, and cross-sector collaboration to ensure resilience and preparedness at local, national, and international levels. The MOU will remain in effect for five years, with provisions for renewal, ensuring a long-term commitment to academic excellence and shared innovation.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

It determines the maximum amount in the Expense Budget, as the City is required to have a balanced budget.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

Riley Williamsbridge-Olinville, Bronxwood, Eastchester-Edenwald-Baychester, Wakefield, Allerton-Parkside, Baychester, The Valley, and Co-op City Biography Kevin Christopher Riley is the New York City Council Member representing the 12th Council District, covering the neighborhoods of Williamsbridge-Olinville, Bronxwood, Eastchester-Edenwald-Baychester, Wakefield, Allerton-Parkside, Baychester, The Valley, and Co-op City. Council Member Kevin Riley is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises and the Co-Chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, which is the largest caucus in the New York City Council. As Chair, he serves to prioritize creating equal opportunity and access for communities of color within New York City through the legislative, oversight, and budgetary powers of the Council. He has worked to ensure that our infrastructure empowers marginalized communities and addresses the housing crisis with initiatives for affordable housing and homeownership. For nearly the past year, the Council has approved 40 land use applications that will result in over 12,000 projected new housing units, of which over 63 percent are affordable. Under Council Member Kevin C. Riley’s leadership as Co-Chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, the caucus has passed the historic FDNY Diversity bill package. Signed into law, the bills aim to address true equity in recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups within the department, as well as requiring the implementation of diversity, inclusion, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training. Council Member Riley, prime sponsor of Intro. 552-A and Intro. 553-A, further supports this goal through annual demographics reporting and ongoing training for all fire department employees— opening clear measures for transparency and accountability. Kevin C. Riley was born and raised in the Northeast Bronx, where he continues to reside. He is a proud member of Butler United Methodist Church where he met many of the people he is proud to call mentors today. Following his graduation from Mount Saint Michael Academy, he attended the SUNY College at Old Westbury to pursue his B.A in Politics, Economics and Law and obtained his M.P.A in Public Affairs and Administration from Metropolitan College of New York. While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Kevin became involved with several student activities such as the Student Council, Residential Life Association and the Divine Nine Greek Council. He was the president of the Mu Omicron chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., and was even awarded with the Fraternity Man of the Year Award. Although his undertakings were vast, Kevin believed that giving back, spreading joy, and illustrating the meaning of community was the most important goal. After working alongside the Speaker of the New York State Assembly Carl E. Heastie for over a decade, Riley’s passion for public service and his love for his community fueled his dedication to run and win his election for the New York City Council representing the home that raised him. Since assuming office on January 6, 2021, Council Member Kevin C. Riley has never lost sight of uplifting his community and its people: investing $97 million in capital improvements for his district, enriching the quality of life through youth and senior services, groundbreaking NYC Public School improvements and advocating for $79.4 million to expand the Summer Youth employment Program to 100,000 slots for youth across the city. As a firm believer in representation and being the change you want to see, Kevin personally understands the impact of mentorship and positive reinforcements in the well-being and success of our youth and community.  He dedicates his time to generate positive relationships with the youth in the community and has developed a Young Men’s Mentorship program with the Academy for Scholarship and Entrepreneurship— exposing them to college readiness, how to dress for success, internship opportunities and more. In conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity brothers, he is a founding member of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives. As a direct product of his community, Council Member Kevin C. Riley is a leader who is committed to partnering with his neighbors, listening to their needs and making his district better for future generations. Above all, his greatest accomplishment still remains being a husband and father to his three beautiful children.

In conjunction with his Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity brothers, he is a founding member of a nationwide organization called The Dad Gang. The Dad Gang is an organization that works toward eliminating the stereotypes surrounding black fatherhood, and dispelling the narrative that black dads are not a part of their children’s lives. As a direct product of his community, Council Member Kevin C. Riley is a leader who is committed to partnering with his neighbors, listening to their needs and making his district better for future generations. Above all, his greatest accomplishment still remains being a husband and father to his three beautiful children.
