Create business opportunities for aspiring teenage and young adult entrepreneurs by connecting them to successful entrepreneurs in growing industries (technology, gaming cybersecurity, healthcare – to make it accessible, construction/ mining, and many more) Create physical space for our youth to be exposed to theater, dance, gaming, and sports Education Funding. Funding Funding . Public education is the great equalizer, empowering students with the knowledge and skills to succeed. A free, high-quality, and memorable primary and secondary public education experience is a human right. Modernizing our education curriculum and supporting our vulnerable student populations is essential to preparing all who live in our district for our future economy. We must identify fundamental teachings gutted from our education system and reaffirm their necessity. Dante will… Fight to keep our public schools public! But, will support all students in the district no matter their parent’s choice for their education.

Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all.  We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue.

NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs.

We must invest in public services and programs promoting connected and healthy communities, anti-violence programs, vital job and workforce development programs, and mental health services. Agencies tasked with keeping us safe from and during emergencies need sufficient resources to keep us safe. Dante will… Support freezing the NYPD budget as is and require future officers to reside in NYC during their employment. Support CM Gutiérrez’s bill to create an office for residential displacement remediation that would serve as central support to city residents displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. (Intro 0749-2024) Work to redirect NYPD funding to precinct community councils to expand community engagement efforts. Work with mail providers, block associations, and tenant associations to prevent package theft. Create a direct pipeline to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals and city employment.

Support our Emergency Service workers (EMS) by modernizing the department’s tech and station unit space Require food delivery apps to refund the consumer the entire cost of the order including taxes. Health & Mental Health Many of the health issues we currently experience have been dealt with for decades. From inequities in maternal care to the health disparities we see in black men to the potential closure of much-needed healthcare facilities, we have historic problems to fix and prevent. We must protect our frontline workers and public servants who work to keep us safe and healthy. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for our safety net hospitals to update infrastructure and meet the demand of future population growth Increase mental health services in communities of color by expanding mobile mental health crisis teams. Support CM Ossè’s bill, which would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to include food service establishments, retail establishments, and health clubs in an existing Opioid Antagonist Program, which already serves nightlife establishments.

Collaborate with willing religious organizations to support the larger community’s health needs. Housing & Development As a tenant who is paying market rate, I feel the squeeze. The rising cost of homeownership and rent is affecting many working-class families. To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating  our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock.

Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement.

The community and allies have fought for the rights we deserve for decades, and that fight continues. Thank you for your bravery. New York City is a model of both inclusion and equality. Trans and queer youth remain under attack by our federal government. We will protect the individual and reproductive rights of all so we can make your own decisions about our own bodies. Dante will… Support the establishment of a commission for LGBTQIA+ older adults within the Department for the Aging to identify challenges, share best practices, and develop expert recommendations on ways to improve the quality of life of LGBTQIA+ older adults (Int. 564) Commit to funding programs that provide housing, training, job placement, and professional development for LGBTQIA+ youth.

We, taxpayers, deserve to live in safe, healthy, and prosperous spaces. Ensuring the agencies we interact with daily have the personnel and tools they need to perform their responsibilities is vital to maintaining what works in our communities for us and identifying low-impact services. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for Department of Sanitation MLP programs Work with agencies to: Increase street lighting on dark residential & commercial blocks Remove derelict and plateless vehicles Translation services for community boards for public meetings Address sanitation issues along commercial corridors Increase street lighting on dark residential & commercial blocks Remove derelict and plateless vehicles Translation services for community boards for public meetings Address sanitation issues along commercial corridors Help agencies continue to build out their multi-lingual resources for outreach Contact Send us an email at: danteforny@gmail.com Paid for by Dante for NY Checks payable to Dante for NY Privacy Policy   Instagram Instagram Site by Kinetic Strategies Meet Dante Arnwine District Info Priorities Contact Meet Dante Arnwine District Info Priorities Contact Donate Donate

Local Law 97 of 2019 as amended (LL97) is one of the most ambitious plans for reducing emissions in the nation. Under this groundbreaking law, most buildings over 25,000 square feet are required to meet new GHG emissions limits beginning in 2024, with stricter limits coming into effect in 2030. The goal is to reduce the emissions produced by the City’s largest buildings 40 percent by 2030 and to net zero by 2050.  The online portal for Local Law 97 compliance reports is now open for submissions at nyc.beam-portal.org . Please refer to DOB Service Notice of March 3, 2025 . For more information on the LL97 reporting process, see the DOB Webinar Series , available under Additional Information & Resources on this page. Please also see the various user guides for the LL97 filing/reporting process available under the Requirements heading on this webpage. Covered Buildings The square footage of a building, as it appears in the records of the NYC Department of Finance (DOF), determines whether a building may be subject to LL97 compliance. LL97 covers: a building that exceeds 25,000 gross square feet two or more buildings on the same tax lot that together exceed 50,000 square feet two or more condominium buildings governed by the same board of managers and that together exceed 50,000 square feet. Tax lots are identified by a unique number known as a borough-block-and-lot (BBL). There may be multiple buildings on a BBL. A Building Identification Number (BIN) is a unique identifier for each NYC building. LL97 compliance is required for each BIN on a BBL where the buildings together or separately meet the square foot threshold described previously. Multiple Buildings on a BBL When the buildings on a BBL together meet the 50,000 sq. ft. threshold, all buildings on the BBL are subject to LL97. However, each building on the BBL must comply with the appropriate requirements for that building. An individual building may qualify for an exception, meaning that building is not subject to the requirements of that section of the law. Individual buildings on a BBL may be subject to LL97 under Article 320 beginning in 2024, in 2026, or in 2035, and others may be required to demonstrate compliance just one time under Article 321. The square footage of all buildings, regardless of compliance pathway or exception status, contributes to the combined square footage of the buildings on a BBL, but each building is required to demonstrate compliance with its appropriate section of the law. NOTE: The Covered Buildings Lists (CBLs) provide information at the BBL level, not at the building level. This means that for BBLs with multiple buildings, the CBL does not distinguish which building is subject to a particular compliance pathway. DOB strongly encourages buildings owners to work with legal representatives and Registered Design Professionals to confirm each building’s compliance requirements under LL97 . Covered Buildings List (CBL) The preliminary covered buildings list (CBL) reflecting the Department’s records for compliance requirements of each property under LL97 is viewable below. The presence or absence of any property on this CBL cannot be construed to relieve a building owner from compliance with LL97 or any other applicable law. This list has been compiled using preliminary data and is subject to change due to: circumstances unknown to the Department as certified by a Registered Design Professional (RDP) change of circumstances in a building. This list is intended only as a reference for building owners to consider in consultation with legal representatives and RDPs. LL97 CBL (PDF) LL97 CBL (Excel) CBL Matrix (PDF) LL97 CBL FAQs Instructions for challenging the inclusion or exclusion of a building from the CBL are found on the LL97: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Violations page. For more questions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of a building from the CBL see the Exceptions/Exemptions section. Exceptions/Exemptions Certain buildings are not required to comply with Local Law 97. These include utilities that primarily produce electrical power or steam, and garden-style apartments. If you believe your property qualifies for an exception, email ghgemissions@buildings.nyc.gov with the subject line CBL Exception . Please include the following in the email: BBL and BIN for such building contact information: name, email address or/and telephone number explanation of your exception and RDP certification if applicable Requirements LL97 was first enacted in 2019 as part of a package known as the Climate Mobilization Act. The original LL97 text was later modified, but the composite law is still referred to as LL97. The law is made up of Articles, which are primary legislation enacted by the NYC Council, and identify different compliance pathways depending on certain characteristics of a building. The law is supported by agency rules, which are secondary legislation enacted by DOB. LL97’s Article 320 covers most private buildings with corresponding rule 1 RCNY §103-14 . LL97’s Article 321 covers certain affordable housing and houses of worship with corresponding rule 1 RCNY §103-17 . Article 320 requires covered buildings to file a report with the Department by May 1, 2025 detailing their annual GHG emissions and then by May 1 of every year after. The report must be certified by a registered design professional. Article 321 covered buildings are also required to submit a report of compliance with the Department by May 1, 2025.

Create business opportunities for aspiring teenage and young adult entrepreneurs by connecting them to successful entrepreneurs in growing industries (technology, gaming cybersecurity, healthcare – to make it accessible, construction/ mining, and many more) Create physical space for our youth to be exposed to theater, dance, gaming, and sports Education Funding. Funding Funding . Public education is the great equalizer, empowering students with the knowledge and skills to succeed. A free, high-quality, and memorable primary and secondary public education experience is a human right. Modernizing our education curriculum and supporting our vulnerable student populations is essential to preparing all who live in our district for our future economy. We must identify fundamental teachings gutted from our education system and reaffirm their necessity. Dante will… Fight to keep our public schools public! But, will support all students in the district no matter their parent’s choice for their education. Be laser-focused on processes to ensure families and students who need Individual Education Plans (IEPs) get their IEPs. Advocate for more government, history, and life skill courses, like typing, to be a requirement.

Work with principals to create Night Schools for youth & adult educational programming. Create funding opportunities for school Parent Associations to engage more families in our education system. Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all.  We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue.

NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs. Dante will… Not support the privatization of NYCHA developments Hold poor Mitchell-Lama development managements accountable Build a prequalified list of registered vendors for no-bid contracts available online. Invest in technologies that speed up complaint monitoring and rent collection.

Build “mini-libraries” using unused space at Mitchell-Lama and NYCHA facilities. Public Safety Keeping our sidewalks, streets, communities, and families safe, ensuring our justice system is fairer, more equitable, and preventative, and ENDING the long history of gun violence in the district is paramount. We must invest in public services and programs promoting connected and healthy communities, anti-violence programs, vital job and workforce development programs, and mental health services. Agencies tasked with keeping us safe from and during emergencies need sufficient resources to keep us safe. Dante will… Support freezing the NYPD budget as is and require future officers to reside in NYC during their employment. Support CM Gutiérrez’s bill to create an office for residential displacement remediation that would serve as central support to city residents displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. (Intro 0749-2024) Work to redirect NYPD funding to precinct community councils to expand community engagement efforts. Work with mail providers, block associations, and tenant associations to prevent package theft. Create a direct pipeline to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals and city employment. Hold the Sheriff’s Office accountable for illegal smoke shops and require the creation of a public list of closed smoke shops to be sent to community boards and elected officials. Support our Emergency Service workers (EMS) by modernizing the department’s tech and station unit space Require food delivery apps to refund the consumer the entire cost of the order including taxes. Health & Mental Health Many of the health issues we currently experience have been dealt with for decades. From inequities in maternal care to the health disparities we see in black men to the potential closure of much-needed healthcare facilities, we have historic problems to fix and prevent. We must protect our frontline workers and public servants who work to keep us safe and healthy. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for our safety net hospitals to update infrastructure and meet the demand of future population growth Increase mental health services in communities of color by expanding mobile mental health crisis teams. Support CM Ossè’s bill, which would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to include food service establishments, retail establishments, and health clubs in an existing Opioid Antagonist Program, which already serves nightlife establishments. (Intro: 0359-2024) Work with developers and landlords with vacant storefronts to bring fresh produce mini markets to commercial corridors. Liaise with State lawmakers to advocate for shorter days and more training for home health aide workers. Increase access to healthy and nutritious fresh food through increasing funding for fresh food box programs. Fund additional DOE Health Food Trucks. Collaborate with willing religious organizations to support the larger community’s health needs. Housing & Development As a tenant who is paying market rate, I feel the squeeze. The rising cost of homeownership and rent is affecting many working-class families. To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating  our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock. Require certain rezonings to require the creation of community space or open space Require developers to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Infrastructure for support. All new developments with 75 units or more are required to build sufficient parking relative to the number of units created and the population demand. Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement. Support enforcement of LL97 to reduce emissions from buildings Expand community garden usage and secure investments in infrastructure Support cultural events and programming by connecting organizations to public funding Additional mobile units must be procured to connect people to IDNYC, New York City’s municipal identification program.

School District 16, 17, 18, & 23 Police Precincts 67, 71, 73, 77, and 81 Endorsements so far...    As your next Council Member, I will prioritize... Seniors Seniors, many of whom are city workers on fixed incomes, continue to feel the effects of gentrification due to a lack of representation in the City Council. Seniors deserve to age in place. We must create opportunities for social interaction through employment, technology, and social programming for older adults. Dante will… Connect homeowners to deed theft prevention programs that exists Automatic SCRIE for older adults in rent-regulated apartments, including Mitchell-Lama developments. Diversify programming at older adult centers by creating a curriculum focused on technology, exercise, and mentorship Work with dental schools and clinics to provide older adults with in-home dental care Support zoning applications, which include the creation of units for seniors. Create an older adult workforce by creating a pipeline to employment Youth & Young Adults We must invest in our youth and young adults now, as their success will be our community’s future prosperity. Technology has opened the door of opportunity for many young adults and even teenagers. We will expand opportunities by providing them with job placement, access to financial support, and the industry exposure needed to build competitive resumes and strong relationships. Dante will… Create CD41 student government advisory council consisting of school districts 16, 17, 18, 23, & (75). Students elect student representatives to speak on their behalf who understand their issues. Connect our youth in schools to more digital mental health services. Advocate for the expansion of the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) from six (6) weeks to nine (9) weeks to allow participants to make more money. Create business opportunities for aspiring teenage and young adult entrepreneurs by connecting them to successful entrepreneurs in growing industries (technology, gaming cybersecurity, healthcare – to make it accessible, construction/ mining, and many more) Create physical space for our youth to be exposed to theater, dance, gaming, and sports Education Funding. Funding Funding . Public education is the great equalizer, empowering students with the knowledge and skills to succeed. A free, high-quality, and memorable primary and secondary public education experience is a human right. Modernizing our education curriculum and supporting our vulnerable student populations is essential to preparing all who live in our district for our future economy. We must identify fundamental teachings gutted from our education system and reaffirm their necessity. Dante will… Fight to keep our public schools public! But, will support all students in the district no matter their parent’s choice for their education. Be laser-focused on processes to ensure families and students who need Individual Education Plans (IEPs) get their IEPs. Advocate for more government, history, and life skill courses, like typing, to be a requirement. Work with principals to implement farm-to-table opportunities in Districts 16, 17, 18, & 23 to build healthy habits at school and home. Work with industry stakeholders to create an artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum or incubator in Central Brooklyn. Advocate for mandatory field trips to increase exposure to cultural institutions and the Arts for students of color. Work with principals to create Night Schools for youth & adult educational programming. Create funding opportunities for school Parent Associations to engage more families in our education system. Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all.  We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue. Support common sense traffic and pedestrian policies and projects around schools, parks, and cultural institutions. Create legislation requiring car share companies to maintain spots for Alternate Side Parking rules. Fund speed reducer (speed bump) request approved for installation in D41by New York City Department of Transportation Work with the Dept. of Transportation to repurpose spots created by the “Daylighting” initiative. Modernize and reform Access-a-Ride to make the experience easier for older adults and individuals with disabilities Advocate for electric buses as the MTA considers redesigns to the Brooklyn Bus Network. Workforce Development & Small Businesses Good UNION jobs means we can negotiate higher wages and greater benefits for workers on projects in the district. I will require all ULURP application in CD41 to use union labor on projects . We will use good union jobs to bring people and families out of poverty and to create stability and securing for working families. And, commercial rent is crippling small businesses across the district. I will negotiate commercial rent stabilized leases to ensure opportunities for small businesses to thrive. Dante will… Support the expansion of merchant associations & BID operations in CD41. Modernize the city public procurement processes to ensure nonprofits get paid on time. Support Commercial Rent Stabilization Advocate for funding to ensure working receive required hours of safety training under LL196 Ensure that (re)development plans in Black neighborhoods include commitments to training and long-term employment in high-quality jobs for incumbent residents. Require developers to fill in gaps in services by reinvesting in community (Bus shelters, trash receptacles, computers for students, graffiti removal, etc. Sit down with leaders in the hospitality industry to create new opportunities for LGBTQIA+ persons and people of color in the 41st Council District who aspire to make in the culinary and beverage industries. NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs. Dante will… Not support the privatization of NYCHA developments Hold poor Mitchell-Lama development managements accountable Build a prequalified list of registered vendors for no-bid contracts available online. Invest in technologies that speed up complaint monitoring and rent collection. Bring resources and information directly to large housing developments by hosting events and programming at developments across the district. Support Family and Community Days at NYCHA development. Build “mini-libraries” using unused space at Mitchell-Lama and NYCHA facilities. Public Safety Keeping our sidewalks, streets, communities, and families safe, ensuring our justice system is fairer, more equitable, and preventative, and ENDING the long history of gun violence in the district is paramount. We must invest in public services and programs promoting connected and healthy communities, anti-violence programs, vital job and workforce development programs, and mental health services. Agencies tasked with keeping us safe from and during emergencies need sufficient resources to keep us safe. Dante will… Support freezing the NYPD budget as is and require future officers to reside in NYC during their employment. Support CM Gutiérrez’s bill to create an office for residential displacement remediation that would serve as central support to city residents displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. (Intro 0749-2024) Work to redirect NYPD funding to precinct community councils to expand community engagement efforts. Work with mail providers, block associations, and tenant associations to prevent package theft. Create a direct pipeline to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals and city employment. Hold the Sheriff’s Office accountable for illegal smoke shops and require the creation of a public list of closed smoke shops to be sent to community boards and elected officials. Support our Emergency Service workers (EMS) by modernizing the department’s tech and station unit space Require food delivery apps to refund the consumer the entire cost of the order including taxes. Health & Mental Health Many of the health issues we currently experience have been dealt with for decades. From inequities in maternal care to the health disparities we see in black men to the potential closure of much-needed healthcare facilities, we have historic problems to fix and prevent. We must protect our frontline workers and public servants who work to keep us safe and healthy. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for our safety net hospitals to update infrastructure and meet the demand of future population growth Increase mental health services in communities of color by expanding mobile mental health crisis teams. Support CM Ossè’s bill, which would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to include food service establishments, retail establishments, and health clubs in an existing Opioid Antagonist Program, which already serves nightlife establishments. (Intro: 0359-2024) Work with developers and landlords with vacant storefronts to bring fresh produce mini markets to commercial corridors. Liaise with State lawmakers to advocate for shorter days and more training for home health aide workers. Increase access to healthy and nutritious fresh food through increasing funding for fresh food box programs. Fund additional DOE Health Food Trucks. Collaborate with willing religious organizations to support the larger community’s health needs. Housing & Development As a tenant who is paying market rate, I feel the squeeze. The rising cost of homeownership and rent is affecting many working-class families. To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating  our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock. Require certain rezonings to require the creation of community space or open space Require developers to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Infrastructure for support. All new developments with 75 units or more are required to build sufficient parking relative to the number of units created and the population demand. Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement. Support enforcement of LL97 to reduce emissions from buildings Expand community garden usage and secure investments in infrastructure Support cultural events and programming by connecting organizations to public funding Additional mobile units must be procured to connect people to IDNYC, New York City’s municipal identification program. Demand Black History be taught in every classroom. Commission local artists to work with agencies to bring more public art to the area Activate open space and plazas by making it easier for small businesses and nonprofits to utilize space. Gain exposure to cultural programming for youth in school and after. Create additional funding opportunities for libraries by better utilizing properties. Expand culinary opportunities in school districts 16, 17, 18, & 23. LGBTQIA+ Every day across the country, LGBTQIA+ rights are being dismantled. The community and allies have fought for the rights we deserve for decades, and that fight continues. Thank you for your bravery. New York City is a model of both inclusion and equality.

This is accomplished by reducing the taxable assessment of the senior's home by as much as 50%. To qualify, seniors generally must be 65 years of age or older and meet certain income limitations and other requirements. For the 50% exemption, the law allows each county, city, town, village, or school district to set the maximum income limit at any figure between $3,000 and $50,000. In addition, there are three sliding-scale options that municipalities may adopt to provide a benefit to seniors with incomes greater than the local maximum. Under these options, qualifying seniors may receive the exemption if their income is below: $55,700 for a 20% exemption, $57,500 for a 10% exemption, or $58,400 for a 5% exemption. Check with your local assessor for the income limits in your community. Application forms and instructions For properties outside of New York City, to apply or reapply for the senior citizens exemption, file the applicable form with your assessor: for first-time applicants: Form RP-467, Application for Partial Tax Exemption for Real Property of Senior Citizens , or for renewal applicants: Form RP-467-Rnw, Renewal Application for Partial Tax Exemption for Real Property of Senior Citizens . for applicants who were not required to file a federal income tax return : Form RP-467-Wkst, Income Worksheet for Senior Citizens Exemption . See RP-467-I, Instructions for Form RP-467 Application for Partial Tax Exemption for Real Property of Senior Citizens . For properties within New York City, visit New York City Department of Finance: Senior Citizen Homeowner’s Exemption (SCHE) . Application deadline In most communities, the deadline for submitting exemption applications is March 1. However, the dates vary in some cities and counties. Please confirm the date with your assessor. You can find contact information for your assessor in Municipal Profiles . Some municipalities permit late filing in certain hardship situations or for exemption renewals. Contact your assessor to see if your municipality offers these provisions. When qualifying seniors buy property after the deadline, then the senior can apply up to 30 days after the purchase. The assessor then has 30 days to decide whether the senior would have qualified for the exemption if the senior owned the property as of the deadline. When the property is owned by one or more persons, and one or more of the owners qualify for this exemption while others qualify for the Exemption for persons with disabilities , the owners have the option of choosing the more beneficial exemption. Eligibility requirements Ownership eligibility You must own the property for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the date of filing for the senior citizens exemption, unless you received the exemption for your previous residence. In computing the 12-month period, the period of ownership is not interrupted by the following: a transfer of title to one spouse from the other a transfer of title to a surviving spouse from a deceased spouse either by will or operation of law a transfer of title to the former owner(s), provided the reacquisition occurs within nine months after the initial transfer and the property was receiving the senior citizens exemption as of such date a transfer of title solely to a person(s) who maintained the property as a primary residence at the time of death of the former owner(s), provided the transfer occurs within nine months after the death of the former owner(s) and the property was receiving the senior citizens exemption as of such date. The period of ownership of a prior residence may be considered where: the property was sold by condemnation or other involuntary proceeding (except a tax sale) and another property has been acquired to replace the taken property; the prior residence has been sold and a replacement purchase made within one year if both residences are within the State. You can prove ownership by submitting to the assessor a certified copy of the deed, mortgage, or other instrument by which you became owner of the property. Cooperative apartments: municipalities are authorized to grant the exemption to seniors who own shares in residential cooperatives. If granted, you would receive adjustments to your monthly maintenance fees to reflect the benefit of that exemption. Life estates or trusts: the life tenant is entitled to possession and use of the property for the duration of his or her life and is deemed the owner for all purposes, including taxation. The exemption also may be allowed if the property is in trust and all the trustees or all the beneficiaries qualify. Manufactured homes: Manufactured homes on leased land can qualify for the senior citizens exemption. If home is located in a manufactured home park, you are entitled to a reduction in rent for the amount of the taxes paid. Income eligibility You cannot receive the senior citizens exemption if the income of the owner, or the combined income of all the owners, exceeds the maximum income limit set by the locality. If you are married, the income of your spouse must be included in the total unless your spouse is absent from the residence due to a legal separation or abandonment. The income of a non-resident former spouse, who retains an ownership interest after the divorce, is not included. If the "sliding-scale" option is in effect, you must meet that income limitation; contact the assessor to determine what the income limits are. For the purposes of this exemption, income is defined as your federal adjusted gross income (FAGI) as reported on your income tax return(s) for the “ applicable income tax year ” (defined below) and subject to the following revisions: Social Security benefits not included in your FAGI are considered income, except where a locality has opted to exclude them from income. Distributions from an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity included in your FAGI are not considered income, except where a locality has opted to include them in income. Medical and prescription drug expenses of an owner that were actually paid for and not reimbursed or paid by insurance may be deducted from income where a locality has opted to allow them to be deducted. If an owner is an inpatient in a residential health care facility, the amount paid for care at the facility by that owner (or by that owner’s spouse or co-owner) may be deducted from income. Any tax-exempt interest or dividends that were not included in your FAGI is considered income. The net amount of loss claimed on federal Schedule C, D,E, F, or any other separate category of loss cannot exceed $3,000, and the total amount of all losses claimed cannot exceed $15,000. Applicable income tax year In localities where the taxable status date is before April 15, the applicable income tax year is two years prior to the current calendar year. In localities where the taxable status date is on or after April 15, the applicable income tax year is the most recent calendar year. However, if you file fiscal year income tax returns, the applicable income tax year is the fiscal year shown on your most recent return. The following taxing jurisdictions have taxable status dates of April 15 or later: City of Dunkirk in Chautauqua County City of Elmira in Chemung County City of Geneva in Ontario County City of Glen Cove in Nassau County City of Oneida in Madison County Cities of Rome and Utica in Oneida County Cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Peekskill, and Rye in Westchester County All towns in Westchester County Villages of Harrison and Scarsdale in Westchester County Proof of income If any owner, or the spouse of any owner, filed a federal income tax return for the applicable income tax calendar year, a copy of the return must be submitted with the application. Applicants who were not required to file a federal income tax return for the applicable income tax year must submit Form RP-467-Wkst with their application, including any documentation as instructed by Form RP-467-Wkst. Your assessor may request additional proof of income or deductions. Age eligibility Each of the owners of the property must be 65 years of age or over, unless the owners are: husband and wife, or siblings (having at least one common parent) and one of the owners is at least 65. Age generally is determined as of the appropriate taxable status date (March 1 in most communities, but confirm the date with your assessor). Some municipalities allow the exemption where an otherwise eligible owner becomes 65 years of age after taxable status date but on or before December 31. Check with your assessor to determine if this option is in effect. The first time you apply for the exemption, you must give satisfactory proof of your age. Residency eligibility The property must be the "legal residence" of, and must be occupied by, all of the owners of the property unless: a non-resident owner, who is the spouse or former spouse of the resident owner, is absent from the residence due to divorce, legal separation, or abandonment, or an owner is absent from the property while receiving health-related services as an in-patient of a residential health care facility during this period, no one other than the spouse or co-owner of the absent co-owner occupies the property (a residential health care facility is a nursing home or other facility that provides lodging, board and physical care including, but not limited to, the recording of health information, dietary supervision and supervised hygienic services). during this period, no one other than the spouse or co-owner of the absent co-owner occupies the property (a residential health care facility is a nursing home or other facility that provides lodging, board and physical care including, but not limited to, the recording of health information, dietary supervision and supervised hygienic services). The property must be used exclusively for residential purposes. However, if a portion of the property is used for other than residential purposes, the exemption will apply only to the portion used exclusively for residential purposes. School-age children Senior citizens are generally not eligible for the senior citizens exemption if they have children living in their home and attending public school. If the child attends a private or parochial school, the senior can still receive the exemption. School districts can opt to offer the exemption to seniors even if the children in their home are attending public school. However, the school district must require satisfactory proof that the child was not brought into the residence primarily for the purpose of attending a particular school within the district. If you receive the senior citizens exemption, you may also be eligible for a STAR credit If you are receiving a Basic STAR exemption on this property, you may be eligible to have it upgraded to an Enhanced STAR exemption. For application instructions see Enhanced STAR Income Verification Program (IVP) . If you are not receiving a STAR exemption on this property, you may be eligible for an Enhanced STAR credit , which is paid directly by the NYS Tax Department. For more information, please see Register for the STAR credit . When you register for the STAR credit we will automatically review your application to determine whether you are eligible for the Basic or Enhanced STAR credit amount. You do not need to register separately to receive the Enhanced credit if you’ve already registered to receive the Basic credit. Changes to the senior citizens exemption for 2024 The law governing the senior citizens exemption was amended in 2023.

The law requires short-term rental hosts to register with the Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement (OSE), and prohibits booking service platforms (such as Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, and others) from processing transactions for unregistered short-term rentals. Starting September 5, 2023, OSE's initial phase of Local Law 18 enforcement will focus on collaborating with the booking platforms to ensure they are using the city's verification system, that all verifications are occurring correctly, and that the platforms stop processing unverified transactions. Short-term rental hosts are strongly encouraged to abide by all legal requirements that predated Local Law 18, the enforcement of which is ongoing in response to complaints. Learn more about registration Visit the Short-term Rental Registration application portal The Short-Term Rental Registration Law also requires OSE to maintain a Prohibited Buildings list. This list is comprised of buildings where short-term rentals are prohibited, either by the law (such as NYCHA or entire rent-regulated buildings) or by the leases and occupancy agreements for the building. Owners can notify OSE that short-term rentals are prohibited in their building. Learn more about the Prohibited Building List Visit the Prohibited Buildings List application portal Short-term rental listings for units in "Class B" multiple dwellings, which have been approved by the City of New York for legal short-term occupancies, are exempt from the registration requirement, as are rentals for 30 consecutive days or more.

School District 16, 17, 18, & 23 Police Precincts 67, 71, 73, 77, and 81 Endorsements so far...    As your next Council Member, I will prioritize... Seniors Seniors, many of whom are city workers on fixed incomes, continue to feel the effects of gentrification due to a lack of representation in the City Council. Seniors deserve to age in place. We must create opportunities for social interaction through employment, technology, and social programming for older adults. Dante will… Connect homeowners to deed theft prevention programs that exists Automatic SCRIE for older adults in rent-regulated apartments, including Mitchell-Lama developments. Diversify programming at older adult centers by creating a curriculum focused on technology, exercise, and mentorship Work with dental schools and clinics to provide older adults with in-home dental care Support zoning applications, which include the creation of units for seniors. Create an older adult workforce by creating a pipeline to employment Youth & Young Adults We must invest in our youth and young adults now, as their success will be our community’s future prosperity. Technology has opened the door of opportunity for many young adults and even teenagers. We will expand opportunities by providing them with job placement, access to financial support, and the industry exposure needed to build competitive resumes and strong relationships. Dante will… Create CD41 student government advisory council consisting of school districts 16, 17, 18, 23, & (75). Students elect student representatives to speak on their behalf who understand their issues. Connect our youth in schools to more digital mental health services. Advocate for the expansion of the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) from six (6) weeks to nine (9) weeks to allow participants to make more money. Create business opportunities for aspiring teenage and young adult entrepreneurs by connecting them to successful entrepreneurs in growing industries (technology, gaming cybersecurity, healthcare – to make it accessible, construction/ mining, and many more) Create physical space for our youth to be exposed to theater, dance, gaming, and sports Education Funding. Funding Funding . Public education is the great equalizer, empowering students with the knowledge and skills to succeed. A free, high-quality, and memorable primary and secondary public education experience is a human right. Modernizing our education curriculum and supporting our vulnerable student populations is essential to preparing all who live in our district for our future economy. We must identify fundamental teachings gutted from our education system and reaffirm their necessity. Dante will… Fight to keep our public schools public! But, will support all students in the district no matter their parent’s choice for their education. Be laser-focused on processes to ensure families and students who need Individual Education Plans (IEPs) get their IEPs. Advocate for more government, history, and life skill courses, like typing, to be a requirement. Work with principals to implement farm-to-table opportunities in Districts 16, 17, 18, & 23 to build healthy habits at school and home. Work with industry stakeholders to create an artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum or incubator in Central Brooklyn. Advocate for mandatory field trips to increase exposure to cultural institutions and the Arts for students of color. Work with principals to create Night Schools for youth & adult educational programming. Create funding opportunities for school Parent Associations to engage more families in our education system. Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all.  We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue. Support common sense traffic and pedestrian policies and projects around schools, parks, and cultural institutions. Create legislation requiring car share companies to maintain spots for Alternate Side Parking rules. Fund speed reducer (speed bump) request approved for installation in D41by New York City Department of Transportation Work with the Dept. of Transportation to repurpose spots created by the “Daylighting” initiative. Modernize and reform Access-a-Ride to make the experience easier for older adults and individuals with disabilities Advocate for electric buses as the MTA considers redesigns to the Brooklyn Bus Network. Workforce Development & Small Businesses Good UNION jobs means we can negotiate higher wages and greater benefits for workers on projects in the district. I will require all ULURP application in CD41 to use union labor on projects . We will use good union jobs to bring people and families out of poverty and to create stability and securing for working families. And, commercial rent is crippling small businesses across the district. I will negotiate commercial rent stabilized leases to ensure opportunities for small businesses to thrive.

NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs. Dante will… Not support the privatization of NYCHA developments Hold poor Mitchell-Lama development managements accountable Build a prequalified list of registered vendors for no-bid contracts available online. Invest in technologies that speed up complaint monitoring and rent collection. Bring resources and information directly to large housing developments by hosting events and programming at developments across the district. Support Family and Community Days at NYCHA development. Build “mini-libraries” using unused space at Mitchell-Lama and NYCHA facilities. Public Safety Keeping our sidewalks, streets, communities, and families safe, ensuring our justice system is fairer, more equitable, and preventative, and ENDING the long history of gun violence in the district is paramount. We must invest in public services and programs promoting connected and healthy communities, anti-violence programs, vital job and workforce development programs, and mental health services. Agencies tasked with keeping us safe from and during emergencies need sufficient resources to keep us safe. Dante will… Support freezing the NYPD budget as is and require future officers to reside in NYC during their employment. Support CM Gutiérrez’s bill to create an office for residential displacement remediation that would serve as central support to city residents displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. (Intro 0749-2024) Work to redirect NYPD funding to precinct community councils to expand community engagement efforts. Work with mail providers, block associations, and tenant associations to prevent package theft. Create a direct pipeline to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals and city employment. Hold the Sheriff’s Office accountable for illegal smoke shops and require the creation of a public list of closed smoke shops to be sent to community boards and elected officials. Support our Emergency Service workers (EMS) by modernizing the department’s tech and station unit space Require food delivery apps to refund the consumer the entire cost of the order including taxes. Health & Mental Health Many of the health issues we currently experience have been dealt with for decades. From inequities in maternal care to the health disparities we see in black men to the potential closure of much-needed healthcare facilities, we have historic problems to fix and prevent. We must protect our frontline workers and public servants who work to keep us safe and healthy. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for our safety net hospitals to update infrastructure and meet the demand of future population growth Increase mental health services in communities of color by expanding mobile mental health crisis teams. Support CM Ossè’s bill, which would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to include food service establishments, retail establishments, and health clubs in an existing Opioid Antagonist Program, which already serves nightlife establishments. (Intro: 0359-2024) Work with developers and landlords with vacant storefronts to bring fresh produce mini markets to commercial corridors. Liaise with State lawmakers to advocate for shorter days and more training for home health aide workers. Increase access to healthy and nutritious fresh food through increasing funding for fresh food box programs. Fund additional DOE Health Food Trucks. Collaborate with willing religious organizations to support the larger community’s health needs. Housing & Development As a tenant who is paying market rate, I feel the squeeze. The rising cost of homeownership and rent is affecting many working-class families. To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating  our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock. Require certain rezonings to require the creation of community space or open space Require developers to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Infrastructure for support. All new developments with 75 units or more are required to build sufficient parking relative to the number of units created and the population demand. Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement. Support enforcement of LL97 to reduce emissions from buildings Expand community garden usage and secure investments in infrastructure Support cultural events and programming by connecting organizations to public funding Additional mobile units must be procured to connect people to IDNYC, New York City’s municipal identification program. Demand Black History be taught in every classroom. Commission local artists to work with agencies to bring more public art to the area Activate open space and plazas by making it easier for small businesses and nonprofits to utilize space. Gain exposure to cultural programming for youth in school and after. Create additional funding opportunities for libraries by better utilizing properties. Expand culinary opportunities in school districts 16, 17, 18, & 23. LGBTQIA+ Every day across the country, LGBTQIA+ rights are being dismantled.

Create business opportunities for aspiring teenage and young adult entrepreneurs by connecting them to successful entrepreneurs in growing industries (technology, gaming cybersecurity, healthcare – to make it accessible, construction/ mining, and many more) Create physical space for our youth to be exposed to theater, dance, gaming, and sports Education Funding. Funding Funding . Public education is the great equalizer, empowering students with the knowledge and skills to succeed. A free, high-quality, and memorable primary and secondary public education experience is a human right. Modernizing our education curriculum and supporting our vulnerable student populations is essential to preparing all who live in our district for our future economy. We must identify fundamental teachings gutted from our education system and reaffirm their necessity. Dante will… Fight to keep our public schools public! But, will support all students in the district no matter their parent’s choice for their education. Be laser-focused on processes to ensure families and students who need Individual Education Plans (IEPs) get their IEPs. Advocate for more government, history, and life skill courses, like typing, to be a requirement.

Work with principals to create Night Schools for youth & adult educational programming. Create funding opportunities for school Parent Associations to engage more families in our education system. Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all.  We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue. Support common sense traffic and pedestrian policies and projects around schools, parks, and cultural institutions.

NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs. Dante will… Not support the privatization of NYCHA developments Hold poor Mitchell-Lama development managements accountable Build a prequalified list of registered vendors for no-bid contracts available online. Invest in technologies that speed up complaint monitoring and rent collection.

Build “mini-libraries” using unused space at Mitchell-Lama and NYCHA facilities. Public Safety Keeping our sidewalks, streets, communities, and families safe, ensuring our justice system is fairer, more equitable, and preventative, and ENDING the long history of gun violence in the district is paramount. We must invest in public services and programs promoting connected and healthy communities, anti-violence programs, vital job and workforce development programs, and mental health services. Agencies tasked with keeping us safe from and during emergencies need sufficient resources to keep us safe. Dante will… Support freezing the NYPD budget as is and require future officers to reside in NYC during their employment. Support CM Gutiérrez’s bill to create an office for residential displacement remediation that would serve as central support to city residents displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. (Intro 0749-2024) Work to redirect NYPD funding to precinct community councils to expand community engagement efforts. Work with mail providers, block associations, and tenant associations to prevent package theft. Create a direct pipeline to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals and city employment. Hold the Sheriff’s Office accountable for illegal smoke shops and require the creation of a public list of closed smoke shops to be sent to community boards and elected officials. Support our Emergency Service workers (EMS) by modernizing the department’s tech and station unit space Require food delivery apps to refund the consumer the entire cost of the order including taxes. Health & Mental Health Many of the health issues we currently experience have been dealt with for decades. From inequities in maternal care to the health disparities we see in black men to the potential closure of much-needed healthcare facilities, we have historic problems to fix and prevent. We must protect our frontline workers and public servants who work to keep us safe and healthy. Dante will… Advocate for increased funding for our safety net hospitals to update infrastructure and meet the demand of future population growth Increase mental health services in communities of color by expanding mobile mental health crisis teams. Support CM Ossè’s bill, which would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to include food service establishments, retail establishments, and health clubs in an existing Opioid Antagonist Program, which already serves nightlife establishments.

Liaise with State lawmakers to advocate for shorter days and more training for home health aide workers. Increase access to healthy and nutritious fresh food through increasing funding for fresh food box programs. Fund additional DOE Health Food Trucks. Collaborate with willing religious organizations to support the larger community’s health needs. Housing & Development As a tenant who is paying market rate, I feel the squeeze. The rising cost of homeownership and rent is affecting many working-class families. To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating  our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock. Require certain rezonings to require the creation of community space or open space Require developers to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Infrastructure for support. All new developments with 75 units or more are required to build sufficient parking relative to the number of units created and the population demand. Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement.

Expand culinary opportunities in school districts 16, 17, 18, & 23. LGBTQIA+ Every day across the country, LGBTQIA+ rights are being dismantled. The community and allies have fought for the rights we deserve for decades, and that fight continues. Thank you for your bravery. New York City is a model of both inclusion and equality.

Menu   Text Size   Search Search  Primary Navigation The official website of NYC Home NYC Resources NYC311 Office of the Mayor Events Connect Jobs NYC.gov Privacy Policy     Print Collection of Information by NYC.gov In order to improve the content and usability of this website,  the City of New York (the "City") automatically collects several categories  of information from users. This information includes the following: The apparent Internet  Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service Provider  ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address  assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully  Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of your Internet Service  Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain  name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example Internet Explorer,  Opera, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a  user's computer. The date and time a user  visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications  used and forms data. The Uniform Resource  Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to NYC.gov (if  detectable), if such user did not connect directly to NYC.gov, or use it as a  homepage or "Portal". The City uses this information to identify site performance  needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors,  and to generally add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. In order to  accomplish those goals, from time to time, the City may conduct statistical  analysis of the data it collects. The City does not collect data for commercial or marketing  purposes, 3 and the City does  not sell,  exchange, or otherwise distribute the data collected by NYC.gov for commercial  or marketing purposes. Information Submitted to NYC.gov During a session on  NYC.gov, a user may affirmatively submit information to the City by, among  other means, electronic mail ("e-mail"), filling in and submitting an  on-line form, screening for benefits and services, or electing to personalize  NYC.gov and use it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted  information is stored in a secure environment, and will be used by the City in  furtherance of its duties and/or obligations to its citizenry (i.e.,  "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes to which your affirmatively submitted  information may include, but are not limited to, the following: Helping the City respond to  a request for information not readily available from NYC.gov Investigating a problem  reported to the City via NYC.gov 5 Keeping lists of parties  interested in some particular issue or facet of New York City life about which  the City anticipates issuing further information in the future. Sending informational updates and conducting outreach on topics such as, but  not limited to, public benefits and services and upcoming City events. Sharing information with other City agencies or offices or other government  agencies for the limited purpose of facilitating services and benefits, in  accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Disclosure of such information  pursuant to a request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL")  or court order, if such information is not protected by federal, or state, or  local law. 6 The City does not rent or sell personally identifiable  information (e.g., information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail,  etc., or other information that identifies or could lead to the identification  of a user as a particular person), nor would the City exchange or trade such  information with third-parties without a user's explicit permission. The City  does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable financial  information other than as necessary to complete a credit card or other  financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user. If a NYC.gov user has elected not to receive further information  from the City, NYC.gov will not send such information. If a NYC.gov user has  elected to receive further communication from the City, NYC.gov will only send  information in categories that are authorized by the user. If NYC.gov sends  electronic mail ("e-mail") to a user, such e-mail is NOT confidentia l, 7 and is identical in  nature to that information generally available to the public and news media. Security and Monitoring In  certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a  password to access or submit personally identifiable information. One should  not divulge a password to anyone, and the City will never ask a user for a  password in a telephone call, fax, e-mail or other form of unsolicited  communication. When a user is finished with an application or applications that  are password protected, such user should exit the relevant page(s). If the  browser used to access said password protected pages is a publicly-accessible  browser, users should close down the entire session and, if applicable or  possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password might  be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The City has integrated industry standard or better security measures  and systems into the design, implementation and day to day operation of NYC.gov  and its underlying servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the City maintains ongoing efforts to identify and/or block  unauthorized intrusions into or onto NYC.gov, and to upload to or change  information on or otherwise cause damage to NYC.gov or the information resident  hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The  act of using NYC.gov constitutes the User’s express consent to the City’s monitoring  of all uses of the system. If such monitoring reveals possible evidence of  criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration  personnel may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials,  as authorized or required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or  entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website,  and to track information during multiple visits to a website. The City uses  "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of NYC.gov,  and such temporary cookies expire upon the end of the browsing session. This  website and NYC.gov generally, do not use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use NYC.gov as a customized  portal, the City uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The  City may also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and  patterns of unique and repeat visitors for 311 Online and other sites on  NYC.gov to enhance their accessibility.  Web Bugs (a/k/a Web Beacons) NYC.gov does not use web  bugs 12 on its web pages or in any  html e-mail generated by use of the portal, or otherwise sent from NYC.gov, for  any purpose other than to identify site performance needs; to ensure  compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors, and to generally  add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. Children No applications on NYC.gov specifically solicit information from minors or seek  to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such  information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of  NYC.gov should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to  NYC.gov by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as  information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City strongly believes that parental supervision is an  important factor in Internet use by minors. Therefore, NYC.gov asks parents to  guide their minor children when children are asked to provide any personal  information online. NYC.gov further asks that children ask for and receive  their parent's permission before providing any information online. Health Care Information Any agency  subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and  its regulations (collectively, "HIPAA") that creates, receives,  maintains, or transmits via NYC.gov any Protected Health Information  (“PHI”), as that term is defined by HIPAA,  must comply with HIPAA’s Privacy and Security Rules.  The agency must also  require its Business Associates, as that term is defined by HIPAA, to comply  with HIPAA when, on behalf of the agency, each such Business Associate creates,  receives, maintains, or transmits PHI hosted by NYC.gov.   Nothing stated herein shall be interpreted  to diminish the compliance requirements imposed by any other applicable law or  City policy. Third Party Links NYC.gov provides links to,  and may be linked from, local, State and federal government agencies, and from,  or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links neither  constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)  or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s),  accessibility or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s).  Nor does any link between NYC.gov and a third-party website imply sponsorship  of such website, or the creator of such website Some content on portions of  NYC.gov resides on servers run by third parties. 13 Each agency providing  content for NYC.gov is bound by NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Any agency using a  third-party host, ISP, ASP or other combination of third-party transport,  storage, content or application provision services shall require such third  party  to comply with NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Intellectual Property The content of NYC.gov's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party  images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are notified, therefore,  that one should presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder  before reproducing or otherwise using images/graphics from this website. NYC.gov may change this policy from time to time, and reserves  the right to do so without notice.  Privacy Statement Footnotes 1 An IP address is a numeric  value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer network, an  individual computer or router, or a firewall (collectively, "users")  so that other computers on the Internet may direct Internet message or other  traffic to such users. Until the IP addressing system is changed, an IP address  will take the form of XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, where the X's are numbers between 1 and  9, and 0 for some positions. The term “user” may also refer to an individual  who has created an account on NYC.gov and any of its subpages. Go Back 2 A Domain Name is an alphanumeric value that represents the plain language (English or such other local language as is relevant) translation of the IP address assigned to a specific user or collection of users. For example, if a user had an IP address of 123.123.123.123, the Domain Name that represented that address might be WWW.HOME.COM. Go Back 3 Commercial and non-commercial marketing purposes include, for the purposes of this policy, Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail (colloquially known as "SPAM" e-mail), targeted e-mail for the purpose of selling products, or the sale or exchange of personally identifiable information between parties that anticipate receiving value in exchange for such information. Go Back 4 The City of New York's duties and obligations toward its citizens are set forth in the City Charter and in all applicable and relevant federal, state, and local law. Go Back 5 When  the City is investigating a problem reported to NYC.gov, the information you have  submitted through NYC.gov may be seen by various people. Among other City  actions, we may enter the information you send into our electronic database to  share it with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or  public policy development. We may also share it with a variety of other  government agencies enforcing consumer protection, competition, and other laws.  You may be contacted by any of those agencies. Go Back 6 Pursuant to Article 6 of  NYS Public Officers Law 87, certain categories of information may be exempt  from such disclosure under FOIL including, but not limited to, records whose  disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under  89(2) of Article 6, or might endanger the life or safety of any person. Go Back 7 E-mail is generally not secure against interception. If a communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information like a bank account, charge card, or other personal information, it is more prudent to send such communication by postal mail instead. Go Back 8 The City maintains user registration information behind a "firewall" and limits accessibility to such information to only those few employees that have special access rights to production systems. Sensitive information submitted by users is transmitted by Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology and encrypted. Go Back 9 For site security purposes  and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the City  employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.  Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this  service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud  and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection  Act, and such other federal, state or local law as is applicable. Go Back 10 Temporary or "Session  Cookies" are cookie files that last or are valid only during an active  communications connection, measured from beginning to end, between computer or  applications (or some combination thereof) over a network. Go Back 11 Persistent cookies are cookie files that remain upon a user's hard drive until affirmatively removed, or until expired as provided for by a pre-set expiration date. Go Back 12 A web bug is a clear, camouflaged or otherwise invisible graphics image format ("GIF") file placed upon a web page or in hypertext markup language ("HTML") e-mail and used to monitor who is reading a web page or the relevant email. Web bugs can also be used for other monitoring purposes such a profiling of the affected party. Go Back 13 These third parties are  computers, computer networks, ISPs, or application service providers  ("ASPs") that are non-governmental in nature and have direct control  of what information is automatically gathered, whether cookies are used, and  how voluntarily provided information is used.
