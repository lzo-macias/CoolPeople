We have candidates running for thousands of offices - mayor, city council, state representative, judge, sheriff, alderman, school board, state assembly, state senate, city manager, trustee, commissioner, clerk, selectman, school committee - even the House of Representatives and US Senate - not to mention a host of non-political elections. How does your system compare to other website solutions? Campaign Partner is the fastest and easiest way to get your campaign website up and running. Unlike other solutions, you won't need hours of training sessions, and you won't have to wait days or weeks for someone to create your site.  The moment you sign up, a fully-functional campaign website is created for you - all you need to do is pick a style and add your own words to the page.  If you're comfortable browsing the web and using email, you'll feel right at home with Campaign Partner. I already have a logo from my campaign signs and literature - can I
        use that on my site? Absolutely! You can easily add your own logo and campaign graphics. We'll even help you tweak your existing logo to match your site. It looks like you offer some features that I don't need - can I disable
        or hide these? Of course! You can pick and choose the features that make the most sense
        for your site. What if I can't figure out how to do something? Am I on my own? Not at all! We have a great support staff to help guide you through the
        process of creating and updating your site.  Here's what some of our customers have said: I have a friend / relative / volunteer who's a web designer. Why should
        I use Campaign Partner instead of building a custom campaign website from scratch? Running a political campaign is exceptionally hard work, and the last thing you
        need to worry about is your website. Even if you're lucky enough to have
        a volunteer who has the technical skills necessary to create a professional-looking
        election website on your timetable, having them available to make changes
        on a moment's notice for the duration of a campaign is likely too much
        to hope for. With Campaign Partner, you'll have a website that you can begin
        using today and easily update at your own convenience. Do I have to sign a contract? Campaign Partner is a month-to-month service - no contracts are required.
        You can cancel or switch to a different plan at any time. Are there any setup charges or hidden fees? Unlike other solutions, there are no additional fees or hidden charges. We even include a free domain
        name (a $15 value)! How long has Campaign Partner been in business? We are currently celebrating our fourteenth year. Can I hide my site until I'm ready to launch? Yes! Our Publishing and Security Settings page gives you complete control over who can see your site.  When you're ready to publish your site, it's as easy as clicking a button. Can I import my contacts to Campaign Partner? Absolutely! You can import from Excel, Outlook, or just about any data
        source. Can I export my contacts from Campaign Partner? Of course! You can easily export your contacts and donor file for canvassing,
        phone banking, or for use with other software like Constant Contact or Mail
        Chimp. Do I need to know HTML or have any special skills to manage my website? If you can use email, you can manage your own political campaign website with Campaign Partner. It's really that
        easy. And if you get stuck, we're here to help! Do I need any special software? Will this work on a Mac/PC? All you need is a computer and an internet
        connection. Can I set up email accounts on my domain? Absolutely! You can create and manage email accounts from within the Campaign Partner control panel. Email accounts are a $3 add-on. Can I register a domain name / web address with you? Yes! We include a free domain name (normally $15) with
        every signup. When you register with us, we'll automatically configure your
        domain for use with Campaign Partner.  You'll own this domain name,
        and can even use it after your campaign has ended.  We also include a free SSL certificate so that your visitors can access your site securely. I already have a domain name. Can I use it with Campaign Partner? Absolutely! It's just a simple change to connect your domain to your new website, and we'll walk you through that process. Will my website be easy to read on mobile phones? Yes - our sites responsively adjust for mobile visitors. Can I use Campaign Partner for an issue awareness campaign or ballot initiative? Yes! We also serve local and county-level political party offices, nonprofits, and non-political organizations. I'm in Canada - can I still use Campaign Partner? Absolutely! Campaign Partner offers built-in localization for Canada.  If you have questions, please don't hesitate to contact us . Can I continue to use my site after I win my election? Yes! Campaign Partner is ideal for sharing news and updates about your accomplishments in office, and staying connected to your constituents.  Keeping your site online also gives you a distinct advantage in fundraising and visibility against any potential challengers. What if I don't need to keep my site online after my campaign, but I
        do want to save my website for my next election? No problem! We offer an extremely low-cost 'hibernate' option to save your website
        until your next election. How do I get started? Just click the big button below!
