She has served in many roles throughout her health care career, from registered nurse to infection prevention and an educator, but her passion remains the same.

“My passion lies in ensuring culturally safe patient care while fostering a positive and transformative environment for my team.”

As the director of patient care in surgical services at Memorial Hermann | Rockets Orthopedic Hospital, she strives to do just that. 

“My focus is on cultivating a team that delivers exceptional care in a safe and efficient manner. By fostering a culture of accountability and support, I strive to empower my team to perform at their best, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and experiences.”

For Shoney, being a leader is not just about performance and outcomes, it’s also about using her knowledge and experience to inspire others along the way. 

“Throughout my career, I have been inspired by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact—not just on patient care, but also on the professional growth of those I work with.” 

That’s why she has continually pursued opportunities for professional growth, earning her preoperative nursing certification to train operating room nurses and advancing her management skills as a graduate of the inaugural Elevate Leadership Program at Memorial Hermann. As a member of EMERGE, she supports other health care professionals through networking, leadership and collaboration.

“By mentoring and guiding new team members, we create a strong, knowledgeable workforce that upholds our commitment to excellence. Investing in their growth not only benefits individual career development but also strengthens our collective ability to provide outstanding care to every patient we serve.” 17 Like Comment Share Memorial Hermann Health System 113,056 followers 4h Report this post As we celebrate our employees in their journeys toward professional growth, meet Shoney.

According to Federal law, your discharge date must be determined solely by your medical needs, not by "DRG's" (diagnosis-related groups) or Medicare payments. You have the right to be fully informed about decisions affecting your Medicare coverage and payment for your hospital stay and any post-hospital services. You have the right to request a review by a Peer Review Organization of any written Notice of Noncoverage that you may receive from the hospital stating that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. Peer Review Organization (PRO's) are groups of doctors who are paid by the Federal Government to review medical necessity, appropriateness and quality of hospital treatment furnished to Medicare patients. The phone number and address of the PRO for your area are: Texas Medical Foundation Barton Oaks Plaza Two 901 Mopac Expressway South, Suite 200 Austin, Texas 78746 (800) 725-8315 or (512) 329-6610 Medicare Secondary Payor Form Talk to Your Doctor about Your Stay in the Hospital You and your doctor know more about your condition and your health needs than anyone else. Decisions about your medical treatment should be made between you and your doctor. If you have any questions about your medical treatment, your need for continued hospital care, your discharge, or your need for possible post-hospital care , don't hesitate to ask your doctor. The hospital's patient representative or social worker will also help you with your questions and concerns about hospital services. If You Think You Are Being Asked to Leave The Hospital Too Soon Ask a hospital representative for a written notice of explanation immediately, if you have not already received one. This notice is called a "Notice of Noncoverage." You must have this Notice of Noncoverage if you wish to exercise your right to request a review by the PRO. The notice of Noncoverage will state either that your doctor or the PRO agrees with the hospital's decision that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. If the hospital and your doctor agree, the PRO does not review your case before a Notice of Noncoverage is issued. But the PRO will respond to your request for a review of your Notice of Noncoverage and seek your opinion. You cannot be made to pay for your hospital care until the PRO makes its decision, if you request the review by noon of the first work day after you receive the Notice of Noncoverage. If the hospital and your doctor disagree, the hospital may request the PRO to review your case. If it does make such a request the hospital is required to send you a notice to that effect. In this situation the PRO must agree with the hospital or the hospital cannot issue a Notice of Noncoverage. You may request that the PRO reconsider your case after you receive a notice of Noncoverage but since the PRO has already reviewed your case, you may have to pay for at least one day of hospital care before the PRO completes this reconsideration. If you do not request a review, the hospital may bill you for all the costs of your stay beginning with the third day after you receive the Notice of Noncoverage. The hospital, however, cannot charge you for care unless it provides you with a Notice of Noncoverage. How to Request a Review of the Notice of Noncoverage If the Notice of Noncoverage states that your physician agrees with the hospital's decision: You must make your request for review to the PRO by noon of the first work day after you receive the Notice of Noncoverage by contacting the PRO by phone or in writing. The PRO must ask for your views about your case before making its decision. The PRO will inform you by phone and in writing of its decision on the review. If the PRO agrees with the Notice of Noncoverage, you may be billed for all costs of your stay beginning at noon of the day after you receive the PRO's decision. Thus, you will not be responsible for the cost of hospital area before you receive the PRO's decision. If the Notice of Noncoverage states that the PRO agrees with the hospital's decision: You should make your request for reconsideration to the PRO immediately upon receipt of the Notice of Noncoverage by contacting the PRO by phone or in writing. The PRO can take up to three working days from receipt of your request to complete the review. The PRO will inform you in writing of its decision on the review. Since the PRO has already reviewed your case once, prior to the issuance of the Notice of Noncoverage, the hospital is permitted to begin billing you for the cost of your stay beginning with the third calendar day after you receive your Notice of Noncoverage, even if the PRO has not completed its review . even if the PRO has not completed its review Thus, if the PRO continues to agree with the Notice of Noncoverage, you may have to pay for at least one day of hospital care. NOTE: The process described above is called "immediate review". If you miss the deadline for this immediate review while you are in the hospital, you may still request a review of the Medicare's decision to no longer pay for your care at any point during your hospital stay or after you have left the hospital. The Notice of Noncoverage will tell you how to request this review. Post-Hospital Care When your doctor determines that you no longer need all the specialized services provided in a hospital, but you still require medical care, he or she may discharge you to a skilled nursing facility or home care. The discharge planner at the hospital will help arrange for the services you may need after your discharge. Medicare and supplemental insurance policies have limited coverage for skilled nursing facility care and home health care. Therefore, you should find out which services will or will not be covered and how payment will be made. Consult with your doctor, hospital discharge planner, patient representative and your family in making preparations for care after you leave the hospital. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

Listen instead Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... A fter almost seven years of service, Weslaco Police Chief Joel Rivera has announced his departure from the Mid-Valley police force as he instead takes the reins as director of the Hidalgo County Urban County Program. Officials selected Rivera to head up the program, which oversees the administration and disbursement of federal infrastructure dollars, during a Nov. 26 meeting of the Hidalgo County Commissioners Court. Rivera’s departure from Weslaco was subsequently made official during a special recognition at a Weslaco City Commission meeting on Tuesday. There, the chief thanked God, his family and the city of Weslaco for the privilege of serving as chief. “I’m extremely proud of the Weslaco Police Department,” Rivera said. “It is bittersweet because I know I’m leaving behind a lot of good people,” he said. Rivera explained how he had been recruited for the chief position by former Weslaco Mayor David Suarez, who, at the time, was working to rebuild the community’s trust after a massive public corruption and bribery scheme had rocked “The City on the Grow.” Rivera took the oath of office as Weslaco police chief in April 2018. The ensuing years, he said, “passed in a blink of an eye.” But in those years, Rivera has also accomplished his goals. “I was brought on board to be able to complete some very specific tasks, such as provide stability and bring some innovation. And we did those things,” Rivera said. “Together, the men and women of the Weslaco Police Department, we did those things. And I’m super proud of my time here,” he added. It’s that ability to get things done — to right a ship in need of a steadying hand — that made Rivera stand out to county officials from among a pool of four applicants. Joel Rivera is seen during a city commission meeting Tuesday, Dec. 3, 2024, in Weslaco. (Courtesy photo) Hidalgo County Judge Richard F. Cortez on Thursday praised the longtime lawman for his administrative acumen. “His maturity, his education. The fact that he has been a chief, you know, managing a large group of people. His ability to work with others,” Cortez said, describing the qualities that made Rivera the county’s perfect pick. Among the candidates who applied for the job were Armando Casa, who once serves as chief of staff for Precinct 2 Commissioner Eduardo “Eddie” Cantu, and now serves as the “No. 2” position within the Urban County Program. And former Mission City Manager Randy Perez, who resigned from that position earlier this year under a cloud of financial mismanagement decisions whose fallout included the termination of that city’s finance director, and the imposition of several financial austerity measures. Back at the county, however, officials are excited for Rivera to take the helm at the Urban County program, which has been without permanent leadership for several months. “Part of what I’ve seen of him is just his ability to reorganize, to come into an existing organization and try to make it more efficient, more accountable,” Precinct 1 Commissioner David Fuentes said. The program has experienced significant turnover over the last year, with its previous director, Marissa Garza, leaving for a position at the city of Edinburg, and a number of “interim” directors leading the program ever since. Fuentes described Rivera as someone who will bring stability back to the department. The Hidalgo County Commissioners Court are seen during a meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2024. (Courtesy photo) The Urban County Program is responsible for administering millions in federal dollars through two main arteries, Fuentes said. Some of the funding gets dispersed to the county and its municipalities through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant, or CDBG, program. Those dollars ultimately fund large scale infrastructure projects in low- and moderate-income level communities, affordable housing, community centers and more. Urban County also manages federal grant dollars that are used for disaster relief, Fuentes said. As director of the program, Rivera will be responsible for coordinating that funding and those project needs with multiple city leaders throughout the county. “It’s pretty demanding when you have to deal with a bunch of local governments and all these elected officials,” Fuentes said. “You have to have a pretty good capacity for being able to communicate effectively while also trying to achieve these goals of spending this money,” he said.

Listen instead Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... A fter almost seven years of service, Weslaco Police Chief Joel Rivera has announced his departure from the Mid-Valley police force as he instead takes the reins as director of the Hidalgo County Urban County Program. A Officials selected Rivera to head up the program, which oversees the administration and disbursement of federal infrastructure dollars, during a Nov. 26 meeting of the Hidalgo County Commissioners Court. Rivera’s departure from Weslaco was subsequently made official during a special recognition at a Weslaco City Commission meeting on Tuesday. There, the chief thanked God, his family and the city of Weslaco for the privilege of serving as chief. “I’m extremely proud of the Weslaco Police Department,” Rivera said. “It is bittersweet because I know I’m leaving behind a lot of good people,” he said. Rivera explained how he had been recruited for the chief position by former Weslaco Mayor David Suarez, who, at the time, was working to rebuild the community’s trust after a massive public corruption and bribery scheme had rocked “The City on the Grow.” Rivera took the oath of office as Weslaco police chief in April 2018. The ensuing years, he said, “passed in a blink of an eye.” But in those years, Rivera has also accomplished his goals. “I was brought on board to be able to complete some very specific tasks, such as provide stability and bring some innovation. And we did those things,” Rivera said. “Together, the men and women of the Weslaco Police Department, we did those things. And I’m super proud of my time here,” he added. It’s that ability to get things done — to right a ship in need of a steadying hand — that made Rivera stand out to county officials from among a pool of four applicants. Hidalgo County Judge Richard F. Cortez on Thursday praised the longtime lawman for his administrative acumen. “His maturity, his education. The fact that he has been a chief, you know, managing a large group of people. His ability to work with others,” Cortez said, describing the qualities that made Rivera the county’s perfect pick. Among the candidates who applied for the job were Armando Casa, who once serves as chief of staff for Precinct 2 Commissioner Eduardo “Eddie” Cantu, and now serves as the “No. 2” position within the Urban County Program. And former Mission City Manager Randy Perez, who resigned from that position earlier this year under a cloud of financial mismanagement decisions whose fallout included the termination of that city’s finance director, and the imposition of several financial austerity measures. Back at the county, however, officials are excited for Rivera to take the helm at the Urban County program, which has been without permanent leadership for several months. “Part of what I’ve seen of him is just his ability to reorganize, to come into an existing organization and try to make it more efficient, more accountable,” Precinct 1 Commissioner David Fuentes said. The program has experienced significant turnover over the last year, with its previous director, Marissa Garza, leaving for a position at the city of Edinburg, and a number of “interim” directors leading the program ever since. Fuentes described Rivera as someone who will bring stability back to the department. The Urban County Program is responsible for administering millions in federal dollars through two main arteries, Fuentes said. Some of the funding gets dispersed to the county and its municipalities through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant, or CDBG, program. Those dollars ultimately fund large scale infrastructure projects in low- and moderate-income level communities, affordable housing, community centers and more. Urban County also manages federal grant dollars that are used for disaster relief, Fuentes said. As director of the program, Rivera will be responsible for coordinating that funding and those project needs with multiple city leaders throughout the county. “It’s pretty demanding when you have to deal with a bunch of local governments and all these elected officials,” Fuentes said. “You have to have a pretty good capacity for being able to communicate effectively while also trying to achieve these goals of spending this money,” he said.

Ask the Expert Legal What are your options for paying medical bills after an accident in the valley? By Guest Contributor - March 15, 2023 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email If you’ve been injured in an accident in McAllen, Brownsville, Edinburg, or anywhere else in the Rio Grande Valley, one of your biggest concerns might be how to pay for your medical bills. Even a minor accident can cause painful injuries that leave you needing weeks of work. A more severe accident can result in long-term or permanent injuries, and you might be out of work for months, years, or the rest of your life. That’s on top of the mounting bills you might rack up for doctor’s appointments, surgeries, prescription meds, physical therapy, and more. So what are your options for paying for medical treatment after an accident? Dr. Louis Patino, a personal injury lawyer in McAllen and founder of the Patino Law Firm, explains how to pay for medical bills after an accident. 1. Health insurance If you have health insurance, it may cover some or all of your medical expenses after an accident. If your accident was someone else’s fault and you’re entitled to claim your treatment costs from the person or party responsible, speak to your insurance provider. They may be able to authorize payment quickly and then recover the cost from the other party’s insurer. 2. Car insurance A standard car insurance policy will pay for medical expenses of up to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident (if more than one person is hurt), but drivers may take out additional coverage. By default, Texas auto insurance policies include an optional type of insurance called Personal Injury Protection (PIP). You can only opt out of this in writing when taking out your policy, so if you can’t remember rejecting it, you probably have PIP. PIP can be valuable, as it covers your medical bills and 80% of your lost wages. Companies must provide minimum coverage of $2,500, but you can usually obtain higher limits for additional protection. 3. Workers’ compensation If you are hurt at work, you may be entitled to workers’ compensation. This type of insurance is optional for Texas businesses, but many purchase it, as it covers medical bills and a portion of lost wages when employees are injured on the job. If you’re injured at work, you should report your accident to your employer and check if they have this insurance. 4. Personal injury claim If your accident was wholly or largely caused by someone else’s negligence, you may be able to file a personal injury claim. A successful claim can yield significant compensation, but you need a strong case and evidence to prove who is at fault. A personal injury lawyer can tell you if you have a claim and how much you might receive. For any immediate medical bills you need to pay, an attorney can issue a letter of protection to delay payment until you receive your settlement.

RGV team in roughly 50 years to win a regional track team championship last season, beating out Smithson Valley by one point for the title.  They left nothing to chance this season, delivering arguably the best performance of any Valley team during the regional meets and scoring 118 points en route to their second straight Region IV-5A girls team championship Saturday at Heroes Stadium in San Antonio.  The 118 points were nearly 30 more than Smithson Valley, who finished in second with 89 points. “It was awesome just hearing them call out McAllen again and again,” McAllen High senior Dariana Luna said. “For us to come up here and winning in the relays, in the individual events and even the field events, its just amazing. I hope the RGV teams have an opportunity to see what we can do and how we can come up here and place. We just hope that they take this and get inspired.” Spearheading McHi’s dominant day was its three relay teams, with two of the three finishing first and the third capturing the silver to secure a spot at the state meet in two weeks.  The Bulldogs 4×100 relay team, made up of Katelyn Vaden, Ava Barreda, Ecklyn Vaden and Sophia Flores kicked things off for McHi, finishing in 47.69 to earn the regional crown. The time is the second fastest time in RGV history, trailing only their own record time of 47.16 set earlier this year.  The same athletes competed in the 4×200 for the Bulldogs, clocking in at a Valley record time of 1:39.03 to secure its second regional title of the day. The time beat their own mark of 1:40.86 set this season.  The Bulldogs relay teams capped their day with a second place finish during the 5A girls 4×400 relay team, clocking in at 3:50.46. The consisted of two of the same athletes from the other two relays, with Vanessa and Yaneli Rocha replacing Ecklyn Vaden and Sophia Flores.  “We really didn’t think the 4×100 was going to be one of our qualifying events, but once we hit that 47 we knew we had something special,” McAllen High senior Katelyn Vaden said. “Last year we finished sixth or seventh in that event and this year we were able to hit first. I think we’re the first team in the Valley to make it out in the event and get first. It’s really nice to just hear that. … It has just been astonishing to see how good we’ve done. I think it’s all about pushing each other in practice. That’s what we do for each other.” Also contributing to the Bulldogs team championship was  Luna. The senior dominated the 5A girls hurdling events, capturing the gold in both events during the meet.  Luna won the 100-meter hurdles for a second straight year, recording a time of 13.90 seconds. The time was her second straight sub-14 second time of the meet, recording an all-time Valley best time of 13.84 during the prelims on Friday.  She followed up her performance during the 100-meter hurdles with another dominant showing during the 300-meter hurdles, winning the Region IV-5A title with a time of 43.35. The mark ranks No. 3 in the Valley all-time.  Luna finished the meet with three medals and state bids, also earning the silver in the long jump Friday. Her 28 points were the most by an individual for McHi’s regional championship team.  “I’m blessed,” Luna said. “Last year I fell short in the 300 hurdles, but I used that to push me this year. I’m glad I was able to come back and take it. In the 100 hurdles, that has become second nature to me. I’m just glad I’ve been able to PR as much as I have been doing and being able to come out and perform like I have been.” The Bulldogs’ regional championship was just one of the many highlights during Day 2 of the  Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships, with the Valley claiming nine individual regional titles and advancing a total of nine individuals and five relay teams to the state meet.  Senior Dana Rojas Vazquez joined McAllen High’s group of state qualifiers, advancing in the 1,600- and 3,200-meter runs. The Houston commit finished second in the 1,600-meter run Saturday with a time of 4:55.82.  Junior Sophia Flores rounded out the Bulldogs state qualifiers, advancing in the 200-meter run after winning the silver medal Saturday. McAllen High’s boys team added a trio of regional champions of its own, with the 4×200 relay team, 4×400 relay team and junior Jacksen Ahlman each winning gold.  Despite having to use a reserve during the finals, the Bulldogs 4×200 relay team still managed to secure the gold and set a Valley record in the event with a time of 1:26.72. The time broke the previous record of 1:27.23 set by Sharyland High in 2011.  “I think it just kind of made us mad losing our first leg because we hold him very dear to us,” McAllen High senior Samuel Enriquez said. “He had to get his appendix removed because literally yesterday he was hurting from his stomach. So he got his appendix removed today. We just kept him in our prayers and did this race for him because he wanted to go to state so bad. He was trying to get off that table after surgery because he wanted to run with us. We told him to chill out and that we’d handle it for him and well we did.” Ahlman added to the Bulldogs gold medal count, capturing first in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:55.28. The win sends Ahlman to the state meet for the first time in his career, improving from last year’s ninth place finish at regionals.  McHi’s boys team put the final touches on a strong regional meet during the 4×400 relay, winning the title with a […] UTRGV baseball rallies past Southeastern in series finale April 19, 2025 HAMMOND, La. – The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) Vaqueros baseball team, which is receiving votes in the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association polls for the sixth week in a row, scored five runs over the final three innings to beat the Southeastern Lions 8-5 on Saturday at Pat Kenelly Diamond at Alumni Field. The Vaqueros (26-13, 17-7 SLC) trailed 5-3 entering the seventh. Junior Thomas Williams and senior Hank Warren led off with singles against Aiden Vosburg (2-2). Two outs later, with the runners at second and third, graduate student Vela alum Isaac Lopez hit a game-tying single. Sophomore Armani Raygoza followed with his 11th home run of the season to give the Vaqueros a 7-5 lead. Lopez finished 3-for-5 with two RBI and two runs scored. Williams went 2-for-4 with an RBI and two runs scored. Raygoza now has 17 home runs in his career, tied for the 11th-highest total in program history. Williams hit his third home run of the season in the eighth, a solo shot, to put the Vaqueros up 8-5. That made a winner of junior Wyatt Wiatrek (6-0), who struck out four in 4.0 innings of relief. Senior Anthony Tejada pitched 2.0 scoreless innings, striking out three, for his first save. The first three Vaqueros reached to load the bases in the first. Sophomore Easton Moomau and senior Steven Lancia followed with RBI-groundouts to put the Vaqueros up 2-0. Mo Little homered off junior Los Fresnos alum Víctor Loa in the second to bring the Lions (31-9, 16-5 SLC) within 2-1. That was it against Loa, who struck out four in 3.0 innings on short rest. The Vaqueros pushed their lead to 3-1 in the top of the fifth. Sophomore Evan Janner led off with a walk, moved to second on a wild pitch, and scored on an RBI-single by junior Damien Whitfield. In the bottom of the inning, though, TJ Salvaggio hit a 2-run home run against Wiatrek to tie the game at 3. His next time up, Salvaggio hit a 2-run double to give the Lions a 5-3 lead in the sixth.

Pioneer’s Thompson steals show during Day 1 of Region IV-5A/6A track championships April 18, 2025 SAN ANTONIO 一 Sharyland Pioneer’s Derek Thompson entered his sophomore campaign in 2024 with high expectations. After a promising freshman season, which ended in a regional meet appearance, the Diamondbacks thrower was forced to watch from the sidelines last year due to an injury to his throwing elbow. Thompson didn’t let the injury bring him down, using his time away from the ring to perfect his form in preparation for his return in 2025. The junior’s non-stop grind has led to electric results in the ring, reestablishing himself as one of the top throwers in the region once again. Just in case there was any doubt, Thompson made sure to cement his status among the best Friday, needing just one throw to secure the Class 5A title in the shot put during Day 1 of the Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships at Heros Stadium in San Antonio. Thompson won the event with a personal best mark of 64 feet, 4 inches, securing his spot at the UIL state track and field championships in two weeks. “Honestly, I would have loved to throw last year,” Thompson said. “If it wasn’t for my injury though, honestly, I wouldn’t have been able to perfect my technique like I did and be throwing like I am right now. Coming into this year was just full of emotions. I was striving to get back out there after seeing some people passing me up. I had to get out here and do something this year. I feel like I’ve accomplished that this year and now we’re going to state.” Thompson’s return to the ring hasn’t been a smooth ride. During last week’s area meet, the Diamondbacks thrower tweaked his ankle during the same event, forcing him out of practice for the entire week leading up to regionals. Thompson debated competing in the shot put after the injury, nearly choosing to focus on what he considers his best event — discus. The competitor in him wouldn’t let him sit out, however, ultimately electing to take part in both events. The decision proved to be the right one, with his first and only throw of the day winning him the title, while also breaking the school record of 60-10 set by his brother, Evan Thompson, in 2023. “The second I hit that mark and saw it was 64 feet I called my brother and told him his record was gone,” Thompson said. “From breaking my brother’s school record and going to state now, it feels good.” Thompson wasn’t done after his record breaking performance in the shot put, following it up with a silver medal during the discus throw not long after to secure his second state bid of the day. Liberty Hill’s Justin Bordelon beat out Thompson for the regional title, recording a mark of 185-1 for the gold. Thompson took the silver with a throw of 179-0. Thompson is now gearing up to make his state debut as a junior, just like his brother did in 2022. “I came in this year with high hopes,” Thompson said. “I’ve been doing really good in discus and shot put all year, setting PRs and school records. … I came here and went into the ring and took my one shot and luckily it was a PR of five feet. It is definitely something special. I feel great. Its just crazy.” Thompson highlights a group of eight individuals who secured state bids during Day 1 of the Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships. Donna High’s Lauren De La Garza and Mission High’s Christopher Kirk joined Thompson as the only two other RGV athletes to earn regional titles during Day 1 of competition, capturing the 5A girls discus and 5A boys long jump titles, respectively. De La Garza won her event in convincing fashion, with her mark of 135-5 coming in nearly four feet further than the next competitor. Harlingen South’s Sophia Gonzalez finished in second behind De La Garza with a throw of 131-7, securing a state berth of her own. Gonzalez also finished second in the shot put to add another state berth. In the long jump, Kirk vaulted his way from the bottom of the standings to No. 1 during his fifth attempt, recording a mark of 23-0.25 to win the gold medal. Kirk’s regional championship marks the first of his career. McHi’s girls team qualified the most individuals of any team during Day 1 of the competition, with Dana Rojas Vazquez and Dariana Luna each earning spots in their respective events. Rojas Vazquez, a University of Houston commit, clocked in at 10 minutes, 51.25 seconds during the Class 5A 3,200-meter run en route to a second place finish and a third straight state meet appearance. Meanwhile, Luna finished second during the 5A girls long jump, securing her first state meet appearance in the event and her second overall state berth of her career. Both athletes can add more state bids during Day 2 of the competition, with Luna advancing to the finals in the 100- and 300-meter hurdles, while Rojas Vazquez is set to compete in the 800- and 1,600-meter runs. Edinburg Vela senior Kristopher Perez and Harlingen High sophomore Jyazian Moore round out the RGV’s regional qualifiers from the first day of events, with Perez punching his ticket in the 5A shot put and Moore advancing in the 6A long jump. Five other RGV athletes reached the podium during Day 1 of the competition, narrowly missing out on guarantee state bids with only the top two finishers from each event advancing. Sharyland Pioneer’s David Zuniga and Angel Rodriguez nabbed bronze medals in the 3,200-meter run and long jump, respectively.  Brownsville Rivera’s Briana De La Cruz added a bronze in the 5A discus throw, while McAllen Memorial’s Jayden Pinkard took and Ann Mabadeje took home third in shot put and discus, respectively.  All five athletes remain alive for a possible wildcard state bid. The UIL Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships continue at 9 […] UTRGV’s Loa, Lopez named to national award watch lists April 18, 2025 Bryan Ramos EDINBURG — A pair of Rio Grande Valley high school baseball products who now star for the UTRGV baseball team were announced as members of the two national award watch lists Friday. Junior Los Fresnos alum Víctor Loa, a left-handed pitcher with the Vaqueros, is being honored as one of the top 54 pitchers in the nation as a member of the Pitcher of the Year Award Watch List. Graduate student and Edinburg Vela alum Isaac Lopez, who plays shortstop for UTRGV, is being honored as one of the top 100 shortstops in the nation as a member of the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List. VICTOR LOA The Pitcher of the Year award honors the nation’s top pitcher and will be presented by the College Baseball Foundation later this year. Loa is one of two pitchers in the Southland Conference (SLC) on the watch list, along with Brennan Stuprich(Southeastern). Loa is 5-1 with a 1.94 ERA. In 41.2 innings, he has allowed just 24 hits, 18 of which have been singles. Opponents are hitting .169 off him. Loa has struck out 39, nearly a batter per inning. Loa ranks 12th in the NCAA and first in the SLC in hits allowed per nine innings (5.18), 17th in the NCAA and first in the SLC in ERA (1.94), 62nd in the NCAA and fourth in the SLC in wins (5), 107th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in starts (nine), and 135th in the NCAA and sixth in the SLC in WHIP (1.18). Loa has allowed just one hit in three starts this season. He’s held opponents to just two hits in each of his last two starts and hasn’t allowed a run in three of his last four starts. In total, Loa hasn’t allowed a run in five of his nine starts. UTRGV is 6-3 when Loa starts. “We are extremely excited about the group of pitchers who are leading the way in 2025,” Pitcher of the Year Award co-chair Chris Snead said. “This will be a difficult choice to select the best of the best!” ISAAC LOPEZ The Brooks Wallace Award honors the nation’s top shortstop and will be presented by the College Baseball Foundation later this year. It is named for former Texas Tech shortstop Brooks Wallace, who played for the Red Raiders from 1977 to 1980. Wallace died of leukemia at the age of 27. The Edinburg Vela alum Lopez is one of three shortstops in the Southland Conference (SLC) on the watch list, along with TJ Salvaggio (Southeastern) and Zane Spinn (Lamar). Lopez is hitting .359/.425/.556 with 10 doubles, six home runs, 31 RBI, 39 runs scored, six stolen bases, and a .982 fielding percentage in 34 games as the Vaqueros’ starting shortstop. Lopez ranks 28th in the NCAA and second in the SLC in sacrifice flies (5), 73rd in the NCAA and third in the SLC in hits per game (1.50), 103rd in the NCAA and fourth in the SLC in runs per game (1.15), 113th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in hits (51), 144th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in runs scored (39), and 202nd in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in hitting (.359). He is also among the toughest to strike out, ranking 137th in the NCAA and sixth in the SLC with just one strikeout every 8.9 at-bats. Lopez has 16 multi-hit games, including seven of at least three hits, and nine multi-RBI games, including three of at least three RBI. He is currently on a 13-game on-base streak. Defensively, Lopez has made just two errors this season and has played flawless defense over the last 21 games. “It’s a great time of the year when we get to start diving into looking at all the shortstops from around the country and who might best represent the Brooks Wallace Award this year,” said Larry Wallace, co-chair of the Brooks Wallace Award. “This list doesn’t disappoint with some stellar offensive numbers along with some outstanding gloves to represent the shortstop position.” For more information on the Pitcher of the Year and Brooks Wallace Awards, visit the College Baseball Foundation website at CollegeBaseballHall.org.   2025 Pitcher of the Year Award Watch List • Ben Alekson, Fairfield, MEAC • Kade Anderson, LSU, SEC • Jamie Arnold, Florida State, ACC • Cam Bagwell, UNCW, Coastal Athletic Association • Trey Beard, Florida Atlantic, AAC • Jack Bennett, Western Kentucky, Conference USA • Ben Blair, Liberty, Conference USA • Colton Book, Saint Joseph’s, Atlantic 10 • Vincent Borghese, Central Connecticut, Northeast Conference • Corey Braun, South Florida, AAC • Brandon Cassedy, George Mason, Atlantic 10 • Gabe Craig, Baylor, Big 12 • Dylan Crooks, Oklahoma, SEC • Liam Doyle, Tennessee, SEC • Joseph Dzierwa, Michigan State, Big Ten • Reid Easterly, Duke, ACC • Riley Eckhoff, Coastal Carolina, Sun Belt • Clay Edmondson, UNC Ashville, Big South • Eric Elliott, Jackson State, SWAC • Kane Elmy, Murray State, Missouri Valley Conference • Casan Evans, LSU, SEC • Blake Gillespie, Charlotte, American Athletic Conference • Cole Giley, Indiana, Big Ten • Jonathan Gonzalez, Stetson, Atlantic Sun • Max Grubbs, Texas, SEC • Aidan Haugh, North Carolina, ACC • Kegan Johnson, Ball State, MAC • Riley Kelly, UC Irvine, Big West • Jake Knapp, North Carolina, ACC • Pico Kohn, Mississippi State, SEC • Tommy LaPour, TCU, Big 12 • Víctor Loa, UTRGV, Southland • Richard Long, Jacksonville, Atlantic Sun • JB Middleton, Southern Miss, Sun Belt • Griffin Miller, Marshall, Sun Belt • Cade Montgomery, Utah Tech, WAC • Blake Morningstar, Wake Forest, ACC • Jacob Morrison, Coastal Carolina, Sun Belt • Cade Obermueller, Iowa, Big Ten • Connor O’Hara, George Mason, Atlantic 10 • Jack Ohman, Yale, Ivy League • Ricky Ojeda, UC Irvine, Big West • Carson Ozmer, Alabama, SEC • Mason Patel, Georgia Tech, ACC • Lane Pearson, West Georgia, Atlantic Sun • Calvin Proskey, USCB, Big West • Brennan Stuprich, Southeastern, Southland […] Regional Track and Field Results – 04/18 – 04/19 April 18, 2025 WRITER’S NOTE: COACHES PLEASE SEND CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES TO [email protected] .

send six to state April 19, 2025 SAN ANTONIO 一 McAllen High’s girls track and field team became the first RGV team in roughly 50 years to win a regional track team championship last season, beating out Smithson Valley by one point for the title.  They left nothing to chance this season, delivering arguably the best performance of any Valley team during the regional meets and scoring 118 points en route to their second straight Region IV-5A girls team championship Saturday at Heroes Stadium in San Antonio.  The 118 points were nearly 30 more than Smithson Valley, who finished in second with 89 points. “It was awesome just hearing them call out McAllen again and again,” McAllen High senior Dariana Luna said. “For us to come up here and winning in the relays, in the individual events and even the field events, its just amazing. I hope the RGV teams have an opportunity to see what we can do and how we can come up here and place. We just hope that they take this and get inspired.” Spearheading McHi’s dominant day was its three relay teams, with two of the three finishing first and the third capturing the silver to secure a spot at the state meet in two weeks.  The Bulldogs 4×100 relay team, made up of Katelyn Vaden, Ava Barreda, Ecklyn Vaden and Sophia Flores kicked things off for McHi, finishing in 47.69 to earn the regional crown. The time is the second fastest time in RGV history, trailing only their own record time of 47.16 set earlier this year.  The same athletes competed in the 4×200 for the Bulldogs, clocking in at a Valley record time of 1:39.03 to secure its second regional title of the day. The time beat their own mark of 1:40.86 set this season.  The Bulldogs relay teams capped their day with a second place finish during the 5A girls 4×400 relay team, clocking in at 3:50.46. The consisted of two of the same athletes from the other two relays, with Vanessa and Yaneli Rocha replacing Ecklyn Vaden and Sophia Flores.  “We really didn’t think the 4×100 was going to be one of our qualifying events, but once we hit that 47 we knew we had something special,” McAllen High senior Katelyn Vaden said. “Last year we finished sixth or seventh in that event and this year we were able to hit first. I think we’re the first team in the Valley to make it out in the event and get first. It’s really nice to just hear that. … It has just been astonishing to see how good we’ve done. I think it’s all about pushing each other in practice. That’s what we do for each other.” Also contributing to the Bulldogs team championship was  Luna. The senior dominated the 5A girls hurdling events, capturing the gold in both events during the meet.  Luna won the 100-meter hurdles for a second straight year, recording a time of 13.90 seconds. The time was her second straight sub-14 second time of the meet, recording an all-time Valley best time of 13.84 during the prelims on Friday.  She followed up her performance during the 100-meter hurdles with another dominant showing during the 300-meter hurdles, winning the Region IV-5A title with a time of 43.35. The mark ranks No. 3 in the Valley all-time.  Luna finished the meet with three medals and state bids, also earning the silver in the long jump Friday. Her 28 points were the most by an individual for McHi’s regional championship team.  “I’m blessed,” Luna said. “Last year I fell short in the 300 hurdles, but I used that to push me this year. I’m glad I was able to come back and take it. In the 100 hurdles, that has become second nature to me. I’m just glad I’ve been able to PR as much as I have been doing and being able to come out and perform like I have been.” The Bulldogs’ regional championship was just one of the many highlights during Day 2 of the  Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships, with the Valley claiming nine individual regional titles and advancing a total of nine individuals and five relay teams to the state meet.  Senior Dana Rojas Vazquez joined McAllen High’s group of state qualifiers, advancing in the 1,600- and 3,200-meter runs. The Houston commit finished second in the 1,600-meter run Saturday with a time of 4:55.82.  Junior Sophia Flores rounded out the Bulldogs state qualifiers, advancing in the 200-meter run after winning the silver medal Saturday. McAllen High’s boys team added a trio of regional champions of its own, with the 4×200 relay team, 4×400 relay team and junior Jacksen Ahlman each winning gold.  Despite having to use a reserve during the finals, the Bulldogs 4×200 relay team still managed to secure the gold and set a Valley record in the event with a time of 1:26.72. The time broke the previous record of 1:27.23 set by Sharyland High in 2011.  “I think it just kind of made us mad losing our first leg because we hold him very dear to us,” McAllen High senior Samuel Enriquez said. “He had to get his appendix removed because literally yesterday he was hurting from his stomach. So he got his appendix removed today. We just kept him in our prayers and did this race for him because he wanted to go to state so bad. He was trying to get off that table after surgery because he wanted to run with us. We told him to chill out and that we’d handle it for him and well we did.” Ahlman added to the Bulldogs gold medal count, capturing first in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:55.28. The win sends Ahlman to the state meet for the first time in his career, improving from last year’s ninth place finish at regionals.  McHi’s boys team put the final touches on a strong regional meet during the 4×400 relay, winning the title with a […]  April 19, 2025 SAN ANTONIO 一 McAllen High’s girls track and field team became the first RGV team in roughly 50 years to win a regional track team championship last season, beating out Smithson Valley by one point for the title.  They left nothing to chance this season, delivering arguably the best performance of any Valley team during the regional meets and scoring 118 points en route to their second straight Region IV-5A girls team championship Saturday at Heroes Stadium in San Antonio.  The 118 points were nearly 30 more than Smithson Valley, who finished in second with 89 points. “It was awesome just hearing them call out McAllen again and again,” McAllen High senior Dariana Luna said. “For us to come up here and winning in the relays, in the individual events and even the field events, its just amazing.

The Vaqueros (26-13, 17-7 SLC) trailed 5-3 entering the seventh. Junior Thomas Williams and senior Hank Warren led off with singles against Aiden Vosburg (2-2). Two outs later, with the runners at second and third, graduate student Vela alum Isaac Lopez hit a game-tying single. Sophomore Armani Raygoza followed with his 11th home run of the season to give the Vaqueros a 7-5 lead. Lopez finished 3-for-5 with two RBI and two runs scored. Williams went 2-for-4 with an RBI and two runs scored. Raygoza now has 17 home runs in his career, tied for the 11th-highest total in program history. Williams hit his third home run of the season in the eighth, a solo shot, to put the Vaqueros up 8-5. That made a winner of junior Wyatt Wiatrek (6-0), who struck out four in 4.0 innings of relief. Senior Anthony Tejada pitched 2.0 scoreless innings, striking out three, for his first save. The first three Vaqueros reached to load the bases in the first. Sophomore Easton Moomau and senior Steven Lancia followed with RBI-groundouts to put the Vaqueros up 2-0. Mo Little homered off junior Los Fresnos alum Víctor Loa in the second to bring the Lions (31-9, 16-5 SLC) within 2-1. That was it against Loa, who struck out four in 3.0 innings on short rest. The Vaqueros pushed their lead to 3-1 in the top of the fifth. Sophomore Evan Janner led off with a walk, moved to second on a wild pitch, and scored on an RBI-single by junior Damien Whitfield. In the bottom of the inning, though, TJ Salvaggio hit a 2-run home run against Wiatrek to tie the game at 3. His next time up, Salvaggio hit a 2-run double to give the Lions a 5-3 lead in the sixth.

Pioneer’s Thompson steals show during Day 1 of Region IV-5A/6A track championships April 18, 2025 SAN ANTONIO 一 Sharyland Pioneer’s Derek Thompson entered his sophomore campaign in 2024 with high expectations. After a promising freshman season, which ended in a regional meet appearance, the Diamondbacks thrower was forced to watch from the sidelines last year due to an injury to his throwing elbow. Thompson didn’t let the injury bring him down, using his time away from the ring to perfect his form in preparation for his return in 2025. The junior’s non-stop grind has led to electric results in the ring, reestablishing himself as one of the top throwers in the region once again. Just in case there was any doubt, Thompson made sure to cement his status among the best Friday, needing just one throw to secure the Class 5A title in the shot put during Day 1 of the Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships at Heros Stadium in San Antonio. Thompson won the event with a personal best mark of 64 feet, 4 inches, securing his spot at the UIL state track and field championships in two weeks. “Honestly, I would have loved to throw last year,” Thompson said. “If it wasn’t for my injury though, honestly, I wouldn’t have been able to perfect my technique like I did and be throwing like I am right now. Coming into this year was just full of emotions. I was striving to get back out there after seeing some people passing me up. I had to get out here and do something this year. I feel like I’ve accomplished that this year and now we’re going to state.” Thompson’s return to the ring hasn’t been a smooth ride. During last week’s area meet, the Diamondbacks thrower tweaked his ankle during the same event, forcing him out of practice for the entire week leading up to regionals. Thompson debated competing in the shot put after the injury, nearly choosing to focus on what he considers his best event — discus. The competitor in him wouldn’t let him sit out, however, ultimately electing to take part in both events. The decision proved to be the right one, with his first and only throw of the day winning him the title, while also breaking the school record of 60-10 set by his brother, Evan Thompson, in 2023. “The second I hit that mark and saw it was 64 feet I called my brother and told him his record was gone,” Thompson said. “From breaking my brother’s school record and going to state now, it feels good.” Thompson wasn’t done after his record breaking performance in the shot put, following it up with a silver medal during the discus throw not long after to secure his second state bid of the day. Liberty Hill’s Justin Bordelon beat out Thompson for the regional title, recording a mark of 185-1 for the gold. Thompson took the silver with a throw of 179-0. Thompson is now gearing up to make his state debut as a junior, just like his brother did in 2022. “I came in this year with high hopes,” Thompson said. “I’ve been doing really good in discus and shot put all year, setting PRs and school records. … I came here and went into the ring and took my one shot and luckily it was a PR of five feet. It is definitely something special. I feel great. Its just crazy.” Thompson highlights a group of eight individuals who secured state bids during Day 1 of the Region IV-5A/6A track and field championships. Donna High’s Lauren De La Garza and Mission High’s Christopher Kirk joined Thompson as the only two other RGV athletes to earn regional titles during Day 1 of competition, capturing the 5A girls discus and 5A boys long jump titles, respectively. De La Garza won her event in convincing fashion, with her mark of 135-5 coming in nearly four feet further than the next competitor. Harlingen South’s Sophia Gonzalez finished in second behind De La Garza with a throw of 131-7, securing a state berth of her own. Gonzalez also finished second in the shot put to add another state berth. In the long jump, Kirk vaulted his way from the bottom of the standings to No. 1 during his fifth attempt, recording a mark of 23-0.25 to win the gold medal. Kirk’s regional championship marks the first of his career. McHi’s girls team qualified the most individuals of any team during Day 1 of the competition, with Dana Rojas Vazquez and Dariana Luna each earning spots in their respective events. Rojas Vazquez, a University of Houston commit, clocked in at 10 minutes, 51.25 seconds during the Class 5A 3,200-meter run en route to a second place finish and a third straight state meet appearance. Meanwhile, Luna finished second during the 5A girls long jump, securing her first state meet appearance in the event and her second overall state berth of her career. Both athletes can add more state bids during Day 2 of the competition, with Luna advancing to the finals in the 100- and 300-meter hurdles, while Rojas Vazquez is set to compete in the 800- and 1,600-meter runs. Edinburg Vela senior Kristopher Perez and Harlingen High sophomore Jyazian Moore round out the RGV’s regional qualifiers from the first day of events, with Perez punching his ticket in the 5A shot put and Moore advancing in the 6A long jump. Five other RGV athletes reached the podium during Day 1 of the competition, narrowly missing out on guarantee state bids with only the top two finishers from each event advancing. Sharyland Pioneer’s David Zuniga and Angel Rodriguez nabbed bronze medals in the 3,200-meter run and long jump, respectively.  Brownsville Rivera’s Briana De La Cruz added a bronze in the 5A discus throw, while McAllen Memorial’s Jayden Pinkard took and Ann Mabadeje took home third in shot put and discus, respectively.  All five athletes remain alive for a possible wildcard state bid.

Junior Los Fresnos alum Víctor Loa, a left-handed pitcher with the Vaqueros, is being honored as one of the top 54 pitchers in the nation as a member of the Pitcher of the Year Award Watch List. Graduate student and Edinburg Vela alum Isaac Lopez, who plays shortstop for UTRGV, is being honored as one of the top 100 shortstops in the nation as a member of the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List. VICTOR LOA The Pitcher of the Year award honors the nation’s top pitcher and will be presented by the College Baseball Foundation later this year. Loa is one of two pitchers in the Southland Conference (SLC) on the watch list, along with Brennan Stuprich(Southeastern). Loa is 5-1 with a 1.94 ERA. In 41.2 innings, he has allowed just 24 hits, 18 of which have been singles. Opponents are hitting .169 off him. Loa has struck out 39, nearly a batter per inning. Loa ranks 12th in the NCAA and first in the SLC in hits allowed per nine innings (5.18), 17th in the NCAA and first in the SLC in ERA (1.94), 62nd in the NCAA and fourth in the SLC in wins (5), 107th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in starts (nine), and 135th in the NCAA and sixth in the SLC in WHIP (1.18). Loa has allowed just one hit in three starts this season. He’s held opponents to just two hits in each of his last two starts and hasn’t allowed a run in three of his last four starts. In total, Loa hasn’t allowed a run in five of his nine starts. UTRGV is 6-3 when Loa starts. “We are extremely excited about the group of pitchers who are leading the way in 2025,” Pitcher of the Year Award co-chair Chris Snead said. “This will be a difficult choice to select the best of the best!” ISAAC LOPEZ The Brooks Wallace Award honors the nation’s top shortstop and will be presented by the College Baseball Foundation later this year. It is named for former Texas Tech shortstop Brooks Wallace, who played for the Red Raiders from 1977 to 1980. Wallace died of leukemia at the age of 27. The Edinburg Vela alum Lopez is one of three shortstops in the Southland Conference (SLC) on the watch list, along with TJ Salvaggio (Southeastern) and Zane Spinn (Lamar). Lopez is hitting .359/.425/.556 with 10 doubles, six home runs, 31 RBI, 39 runs scored, six stolen bases, and a .982 fielding percentage in 34 games as the Vaqueros’ starting shortstop. Lopez ranks 28th in the NCAA and second in the SLC in sacrifice flies (5), 73rd in the NCAA and third in the SLC in hits per game (1.50), 103rd in the NCAA and fourth in the SLC in runs per game (1.15), 113th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in hits (51), 144th in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in runs scored (39), and 202nd in the NCAA and eighth in the SLC in hitting (.359). He is also among the toughest to strike out, ranking 137th in the NCAA and sixth in the SLC with just one strikeout every 8.9 at-bats. Lopez has 16 multi-hit games, including seven of at least three hits, and nine multi-RBI games, including three of at least three RBI. He is currently on a 13-game on-base streak. Defensively, Lopez has made just two errors this season and has played flawless defense over the last 21 games. “It’s a great time of the year when we get to start diving into looking at all the shortstops from around the country and who might best represent the Brooks Wallace Award this year,” said Larry Wallace, co-chair of the Brooks Wallace Award. “This list doesn’t disappoint with some stellar offensive numbers along with some outstanding gloves to represent the shortstop position.” For more information on the Pitcher of the Year and Brooks Wallace Awards, visit the College Baseball Foundation website at CollegeBaseballHall.org.   2025 Pitcher of the Year Award Watch List • Ben Alekson, Fairfield, MEAC • Kade Anderson, LSU, SEC • Jamie Arnold, Florida State, ACC • Cam Bagwell, UNCW, Coastal Athletic Association • Trey Beard, Florida Atlantic, AAC • Jack Bennett, Western Kentucky, Conference USA • Ben Blair, Liberty, Conference USA • Colton Book, Saint Joseph’s, Atlantic 10 • Vincent Borghese, Central Connecticut, Northeast Conference • Corey Braun, South Florida, AAC • Brandon Cassedy, George Mason, Atlantic 10 • Gabe Craig, Baylor, Big 12 • Dylan Crooks, Oklahoma, SEC • Liam Doyle, Tennessee, SEC • Joseph Dzierwa, Michigan State, Big Ten • Reid Easterly, Duke, ACC • Riley Eckhoff, Coastal Carolina, Sun Belt • Clay Edmondson, UNC Ashville, Big South • Eric Elliott, Jackson State, SWAC • Kane Elmy, Murray State, Missouri Valley Conference • Casan Evans, LSU, SEC • Blake Gillespie, Charlotte, American Athletic Conference • Cole Giley, Indiana, Big Ten • Jonathan Gonzalez, Stetson, Atlantic Sun • Max Grubbs, Texas, SEC • Aidan Haugh, North Carolina, ACC • Kegan Johnson, Ball State, MAC • Riley Kelly, UC Irvine, Big West • Jake Knapp, North Carolina, ACC • Pico Kohn, Mississippi State, SEC • Tommy LaPour, TCU, Big 12 • Víctor Loa, UTRGV, Southland • Richard Long, Jacksonville, Atlantic Sun • JB Middleton, Southern Miss, Sun Belt • Griffin Miller, Marshall, Sun Belt • Cade Montgomery, Utah Tech, WAC • Blake Morningstar, Wake Forest, ACC • Jacob Morrison, Coastal Carolina, Sun Belt • Cade Obermueller, Iowa, Big Ten • Connor O’Hara, George Mason, Atlantic 10 • Jack Ohman, Yale, Ivy League • Ricky Ojeda, UC Irvine, Big West • Carson Ozmer, Alabama, SEC • Mason Patel, Georgia Tech, ACC • Lane Pearson, West Georgia, Atlantic Sun • Calvin Proskey, USCB, Big West • Brennan Stuprich, Southeastern, Southland […]  April 18, 2025 Bryan Ramos EDINBURG — A pair of Rio Grande Valley high school baseball products who now star for the UTRGV baseball team were announced as members of the two national award watch lists Friday.

We may also disclose your personal information when we believe the law or legal process requires such disclosure. Please note that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.
