Gibson Bronx Borough President     Vanessa L. Gibson was elected as the 14th Bronx Borough President on November 2, 2021, entrusted with serving the borough’s vibrant and diverse population of over 1.4 million residents. A proud native New Yorker, Ms. Gibson has dedicated her career to serving the people of the West Bronx. Her journey began in January 2001, when she joined the New York State Assembly Intern Program while a student at the University of Albany. She was assigned to work with then-Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene, where she gained invaluable experience engaging in legislative work, attending meetings, and connecting with constituents and community groups. After graduating, Ms. Gibson transitioned into the role of Legislative Aide and later District Manager, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Assembly office. She managed staff and ensured effective constituent services. Following Assemblywoman Greene’s resignation in May 2009 after 28 years in office, Ms. Gibson ran for the New York State Assembly, winning a special election on June 2, 2009, to represent the 77th District. During her two terms in the Assembly, Ms. Gibson advocated for crucial issues affecting her community. In 2013, she ran for an open seat in the New York City Council, succeeding the term-limited Council Member Helen Diane Foster. She was elected to the Council in November 2013. As a Council Member, Ms. Gibson became a leading voice in key areas such as education, affordable housing, public safety, and criminal justice reform. She championed alternatives to incarceration, tenant protections, and enhanced police training. She made history as the first African American woman to chair the New York City Council Public Safety Committee. In 2017, Ms. Gibson worked with then-Council Member Mark Levine to pass the landmark Right to Counsel legislation, providing free legal representation for low-income tenants facing eviction in Housing Court. She also led efforts to establish a comprehensive, ten-year food strategy for New York City, focusing on improving access to healthy food, supporting community gardens, and addressing food deserts. In 2020, Ms. Gibson announced her candidacy for Bronx Borough President, bringing forward a vision to tackle pressing issues including public safety, food equity, housing insecurity, health and wellness, gender equity, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community. After securing victories in both the primary and general elections, she made history again as the first woman and the first African American to hold the office of Bronx Borough President. Since taking office, Borough President Gibson has launched numerous initiatives to improve the lives of Bronx residents. She spearheaded a campaign to combat hunger and improve nutrition, working in partnership with local farmers’ markets. Recognizing the importance of bridging the digital divide, she secured over $50 million in capital funding to enhance technology in Bronx schools, ensuring students have access to modern learning tools. She has also championed efforts to reimagine the historic Kingsbridge Armory, with plans to transform it into an economic powerhouse for the borough. Borough President Gibson has been a staunch advocate for public safety. She works closely with the New York City Police Department, anti-gun violence organizations, and violence interrupters to reduce crime and create safer communities. Her initiatives include securing funding for security cameras and advocating for stronger fire safety laws following the devastating Twin Parks fire. Additionally, she hosts fire safety workshops to raise awareness about prevention. Borough President Gibson is also working closely with the New York State Department of Labor to create pathways to employment for job seekers across the borough. By connecting residents with job opportunities and providing workforce development resources, she aims to reduce unemployment and help individuals build sustainable careers. She also collaborates with the Bronx Economic Development Corporation to offer financial support to struggling businesses, helping them recover and flourish in a post-pandemic economy. Through her leadership and tireless commitment to the Bronx, Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson continues to shape a brighter future for the borough and its residents.
