CityFHEPS (the City Fighting Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement) is a rental assistance program that helps individuals and families find and keep housing. CityFHEPS pays part of eligible tenants monthly rent anywhere in New York State for up to five years. It is administered by the Department of Social Services (DSS), which includes both the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) and the Human Resources Administration (HRA). CityFHEPS can now support New Yorkers with housing across New York State. To learn more about how CityFHEPS supports housing statewide, see Statewide CityFHEPS . Learn about CityFHEPS If you are currently in a shelter, read the Frequently Asked Questions: English , Spanish/Español , Chinese (Traditional)/繁體中文 , Chinese (Simplified)/简体中文 , Russian/Русский , Arabic / العربية , Haitian Creole/Kreyòl Ayisyen , Korean/한국어 , Bengali/বাংলা , Urdu / اردو , Polish/Polski , French/Français If you are at risk of entering shelter , read the Frequently Asked Questions: English , Spanish/Español , Chinese (Traditional)/繁體中文 , Chinese (Simplified)/简体中文 , Russian/Русский , Arabic / العربية , Haitian Creole/Kreyòl Ayisyen , Korean/한국어 , Bengali/বাংলা , Urdu / اردو , Polish/Polski , French/Français If you are a landlord : Read the CityFHEPS Frequently Asked Questions for Landlords and Brokers Learn how to register an apartment, room, or SRO to rent through CityFHEPS Find ALL forms and documents for CityFHEPS: Important CityFHEPS Forms and Documents  Click a topic, or press the enter key on a topic, to reveal its answer.

Important Information for Current CityFHEPS Tenants My financial circumstances have changed, who do I notify? If you are currently receiving CityFHEPS and your income has changed or your CityFHEPS rent has increased, your local Homebase can assist you with requesting a modification to your CityFHEPS Rental Assistance Supplement. What happens if I have had a change in my household? If your household has had a change such as less income, an increase in rent, new household member etc., and you need to request a modification, download and submit the Modification Request form from our CityFHEPS documents page (listed under Additional Documents for Tenants). How do I renew my CityFHEPS? If you failed to renew your CityFHEPS, you can still do so! The fastest and easiest way is to submit online through the ACCESS HRA website ( www.nyc.gov/accesshra ) or on the ACCESS HRA mobile app. You can also download a Renewal Request form from our CityFHEPS documents page (listed under Additional Documents for Tenants). Once you complete it, send it to us by email or mail as indicated on the form, along with copies of any necessary documents. The agency will send you a receipt once your application is submitted. The receipt will be sent to you in the same way you renewed your application. What happened to LINC, SEPS and CityFEPS? CityFHEPS has combined the LINC, SEPS and CityFEPS rental assistance program into one. This makes it easier for people to get help, for landlords to get paid, and for DSS to manage cases. New LINC, SEPS, and CITYFEPS applications are no longer being accepted. Starting April 1, 2019, current SEPS and LINC 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 clients will switch to CityFHEPS when they renew. CITYFEPS clients will be transitioned to CityFHEPS over the next year. Nothing will change for clients already enrolled in LINC 6. I need more help. If you need additional help or have an issue with the rental amount, call the Rental Assistance Call Center through the DSS OneNumber at 718-557-1399.

Shanel is focused on building a brighter future for generations of Queens families.  Shanel’s family raised her to always be rooted in service and advocacy. Shanel’s mother is from a small country town in Maryland, just a few miles from the birthplace of Harriet Tubman. Her mother raised her and two of her siblings as a single mother, while her father was stationed abroad in the Army. To be closer to Shanel’s father’s family, they moved to the East Elmhurst/Corona neighborhoods — where Shanel was born. Shanel’s family raised her to always be rooted in service and advocacy.

Shanel attended the Learning Tree Pre School on 99th and Northern Blvd, St. John’s Lutheran School in College Point, and graduated from Christ the King High School in the top 20 in her class. Even still, the college advisors told Shanel that she should attend an in-state school and she definitely wouldn’t have the finances to study abroad, a dream of hers. While they might not have believed in her, Shanel did, and so did her family. Against all odds, powered by her community, Shanel overcame the challenge and was admitted to Howard University, her dream school, and studied abroad in Paris.

Her experience at Howard taught her fortitude, resilience, overcoming adversity and set the blueprint for a scholarship program she would later bring back to her community. This scholarship provided tuition, paid internships and a job offer upon graduation. Shanel graduated with a BA in International Business with a concentration in marketing and a Masters in Public Administration from Howard University. She has also pursued studies abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, and the Cultural Institute in Oaxaca, Mexico. Her educational journey is a huge part of why investing in the next generation has always been a top priority for Shanel.

In 2001 Shanel started her first business while in graduate school at Howard and has owned and operated a business ever since in addition to working various 9 to 5’s.  Shanel’s first 9 to 5 job was working as a cashier at La Guardia Airport from the age of 16 until she left for college at 18, a career that would soon bloom into something more when she moved back to Queens after her four years in DC. Shanel served as the Community Outreach Manager for the LaGuardia Redevelopment Program where she pioneered a number of initiatives to directly benefit Corona and East Elmhurst. This included launching the LaGuardia Career Center at Elmcor, establishing the LaGuardia Redevelopment Opportunity Scholarship, initiating the STEM Summer Camp at Langston Hughes Library and East Elmhurst Library, and so much more.
