0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Alexa’s Platform Councilmember Alexa Avilés fights to keep Brooklyn affordable for working New Yorkers. Since her election in 2021, she has secured major investments for District 38 and working-class New Yorkers across the city —  from restoring hundreds of millions in education funding, to securing multi-million dollar investments for neighborhood parks like Rainbow Playground and Martin Luther Park. She has also led the charge for major legislative victories for working-class Brooklyn — from protecting tenants after devastating fires, to taking on corporate polluters and fighting for clean air for our communities. And she’s fought against Mayor Adams’s reckless cuts to vital city services, demanding full funding for education, libraries, sanitation and parks. Ready for a New York City that works for the workers, not the ultra-wealthy? Read our 2025 platform and see how our movement is building a city that works for the many, not the few. Quality & Equitable Education for All As a former public-school student and the mother of two public school students, Alexa has witnessed the inequities and injustices of NYC’s school system firsthand. Elected leaders at every level of government must recognize that fully funding our public schools and ensuring culturally appropriate and positive school environments are essential to the future of our city and our country. NYC public schools continue to be understaffed and lack the appropriate level of resources to ensure every student succeeds. During her tenure Alexa has centered the importance of funding and appropriate staffing for our diverse and differently abled children. She has strenuously advocated against mayoral funding cuts to both K-12 public education and CUNY and invested millions of dollars in facility improvements, equipment and programming for local schools across the district. She successfully advocated for NYC DOE to stop problematic regulations that would have rolled back student data privacy protections and successfully advocated a $3M investment in the creation of a Latino studies curriculum for K-12 schools. She remains committed to advocating for appropriate levels of funding and services for children with special needs, especially for ENL students who face additional barriers. She will continue to work with her local schools, PTAs, students and advocates to fight for fully funded public schools. Lastly, Alexa is a staunch supporter of universal childcare and will continue to fight to obtain free, quality, accessible care for all New Yorkers. Read our full education platform Safe, Affordable and Dignified Housing Since joining the New York City Council in 2022, Alexa has fought the wealthy developers and politicians who want to make this city a playground for the rich. Here’s how we’re building a city where every New Yorker can have an affordable, safe, and dignified home. What we’ve accomplished: Improved transparency for NYCHA management : More than 16,000 of the city’s public housing units are now managed by private companies. These privately managed NYCHA units are subject to less oversight than those under public control, and have higher eviction rates and slower response times to maintenance and repair requests. In 2024, Alexa passed legislation that holds these private companies to account for their management of public housing, and requires companies to report their eviction rates, repair costs, and how long it takes companies to complete vital repairs. Made sure renters don’t lose their homes after fires: After deadly fires destroyed apartments across NYC, Alexa fought for legislation that protects renters after devastating fires . The new law requires the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to work with the city’s Fire Department to make sure tenants know their rights when they are displaced by fires, and protect them from illegal evictions and delayed repairs. Stood with rent-stabilized tenants: Nearly one million apartments in NYC are rent-stabilized, providing protection to renters from massive rent increases from landlords.Yet in the midst of the city’s housing crisis, Mayor Eric Adams oversaw major rent hikes to rent-stabilized tenants, allowing his Rent Guidelines Board appointees to increase rent for 2.5 million New Yorkers. Alexa fought the mayor’s rent hikes and protested the big landlords who raised the rent. Her activism showed tenants how the Rent Guidelines Board works and put pressure on the mayor for raising rents in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis. Stabilized thousands of District 38 tenants with constituent services: Alexa’s constituent services team has assisted thousands of District 38 tenants with housing issues — from helping secure housing vouchers and assistance programs, to securing long-overdue repairs in apartments across the district. Developed community-centered land use policies : More than half of renters in District 38 are rent-burdened. Alexa’s team worked with community groups and constituents across the district to develop land use principles that put the needs of our residents front and center. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term : Fight slumlords: When a landlord consistently refuses to make repairs, harasses tenants, and doesn’t respond to complaints and violations, the City must escalate its code enforcement. Alexa will support funding for more code enforcement and champion legislation to take homes back from the city’s worst landlords who put more New Yorkers at risk of losing their homes. Expand community ownership: Real estate investors and private equity are buying up buildings throughout New York City, skyrocketing rents and making homeownership even more out of reach for us. In her next term, Alexa will fight for the Community Land Act package , which allows community land trusts and nonprofits to develop new and preserve existing permanently affordable housing. Protect tenants: In her next term, Alexa will help rebuild the Office of Tenant Protections. She will fight to restore the $25 million Mayor Adams cut from the office and make sure tenants have legal support when dealing with landlords who refuse to make basic repairs. Fund NYCHA and public housing repairs: District 38 contains two of the largest public housing complexes in Brooklyn — Red Hook East & Red Hook West. Public housing plays a vital role in keeping New York City affordable for working residents. As former chair of the Alexa won significant investments to cover rental arrears for NYCHA residents left out during COVID, added hundreds of millions for repairs, and restored cuts from Mayor Adams to the Vacant Unit Readiness program, which prepares and rehabilitates NYCHA units for new tenants. In her next term, Alexa will fight for funding for NYCHA, including much-needed repairs to ensure all public housing residents can live in dignified housing. Lowering the Cost of Living Working-class families are fleeing the city due to the high cost of living. Meanwhile, more and more millionaires have flocked to New York City in the years since the height of the COVID pandemic. We must stop the exodus of working New Yorkers from the city. Here’s how we’re creating a Brooklyn that we all can afford. What we’ve accomplished: Helped District 38 residents afford their utilities, groceries, and other basic needs: 85 percent of New Yorkers say the cost of food is rising faster than their incomes. Working New Yorkers are also struggling to pay utility bills, and access affordable healthcare. Since taking office, Alexa’s office has prioritized making sure District 38 residents can afford basic needs like groceries and medical care for their families, and helped more than one thousand constituents apply and recertify for public benefits. Clawed back stolen money from scammers: Scammers have rigged ATM machines to steal money from New Yorkers receiving food stamps (SNAP) benefits and Excluded Workers Fund benefits from the state, taking tens of thousands of dollars from hard-working New Yorkers to buy high-end watches and other luxury goods. Alexa’s constituent services team worked to claw back those benefits and make sure scammers didn’t prevent district residents from paying rent or buying groceries. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term : Expand tax credits to working families : The wealthiest New Yorkers and corporations pay less in taxes than working-class New Yorkers. We need the state to change our tax code to make sure working families can afford food, rent, and utilities. Alexa passed a resolution in the City Council to expand tax credits for working families, and will advocate with her state colleagues to pass these credits and put money in the pockets of working-class New Yorkers. Expand Fair Fares program to more New Yorkers : Alexa will fight to expand the Fair Fares program, which cuts the cost of public transportation in half for eligible New Yorkers. She will also fight to build a fair tax system and tax the rich at the state level and use the revenue to expand free public transportation across the five boroughs. Put more dollars in New Yorkers’ pockets : Thousands of New Yorkers are eligible for public assistance programs that help them afford food, healthcare, and other basic needs. Yet far too many struggle to apply for those benefits due to technological and language barriers, and serious short-staffing at the Human Resources Administration, the city’s department that manages social services. Alexa will fight to make sure more New Yorkers, including elderly residents and new families, are accessing these vital programs. She will fight to fully invest in a government that works for all of us and increase funding for outreach and education to make sure no New Yorker needlessly goes without food or healthcare. Protecting Our Immigrant Neighbors 40 percent of New Yorkers are immigrants. Trump and Musk’s cruel policy of mass deportations is bringing chaos to our city and threatens to tear families apart. As chair of the New York City Council’s immigration committee, Alexa will stand up to Trump’s cruelty and fight for a city where no one needs to live in fear of unlawful arrests. Here’s how we’re building a New York that supports the rights of all New Yorkers, no matter where they were born: What we’ve accomplished: Stopped the harassment of immigrant New Yorkers: When Eric Adams tried to weaken forty years of NYC sanctuary city laws, Alexa was on the frontlines fighting to make sure ICE doesn’t make unlawful raids in municipal facilities. Expanded legal and adult education services for all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status: Alexa fought against cuts to adult education services, which connects all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status, to programs that help adults improve their literacy, learn English, and complete a high school education. Alexa’s office has also expanded constituent services, including working with CUNY Citizenship Now! to offer free and confidential legal support, organizing multilingual Know Your Rights workshops, and offering free, multilingual tax preparation services in-office. Invested in language access : In one of the world’s most linguistically diverse cities, Alexa helped secure $2 million to expand interpretation services across the city, including a first-of-its-kind Community Interpreter Bank that allows all New York residents to access information and services in the languages spoken in their homes. She also helped secure $10 million to adult literacy programs that help New Yorkers with English language learning and GED coursework — the largest increase in decades. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term : Protect New Yorkers from unlawful arrests from ICE: Since Trump took office in 2025, New Yorkers are under threat from a vengeful federal administration that tears families apart, disappears New York City residents, and throws them in jails thousands of miles from their home. Alexa will continue to fight our sell-out mayor and make sure the city doesn’t unwind long-standing laws that protect New Yorkers from chaotic raids and arrests that make all of us less safe. Stop Eric Adams from evicting families from shelters: In the midst of the city’s homelessness crisis, Eric Adams pushed to kick asylum seekers and their families out of the city’s shelter system. Alexa will continue to fight against this policy, which will increase street homelessness and cost the city billions in lost wages. In her next term, Alexa will advance legislation that rescinds this cruel policy from the Mayor. Fight Trump and Musk’s chaotic agenda: From ending birthright citizenship to ending Temporary Protection Status for Haitians and other immigrant New York residents, Trump and Musk’s cruel immigration policies make New York City less safe and more unstable. In her next term, Alexa will support local legislation to defend our city from the billionaires’ chaos — from pushing local laws and resolutions defending our neighbors, to supporting the city’s lawsuits against the Trump administration, to joining immigration advocates to resist deportations and cuts to vital services that benefit all New Yorkers. Building a Climate-Resilient Brooklyn From Superstorm Sandy to Hurricane Ida, the climate crisis has arrived in Brooklyn. District 38 residents are vulnerable to extreme heat waves, flooding, and dangerous sea level rise. Alexa has fought for clean air in our communities, protections for our coastal communities, and expanding green spaces in our neighborhoods to reduce flooding and heat islands. Here’s how we’ll fight for a livable Brooklyn: What we’ve accomplished: Held corporations accountable for pollution: Corporate polluters like Amazon have clogged our streets and polluted our air with last-mile distribution facilities, which are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color. Alexa pushed the city to study and establish regulations for last-mile distribution facilities and hold companies to account for adding air pollution to our communities. She also passed major legislation requiring corporate cruise ship companies to connect to electric shore power when docked rather than idling with diesel engines. Prevent children’s exposure to air pollution : After constituents raised concerns about their children breathing in exhaust at neighborhood parks, Alexa passed legislation to restrict cars idling outside of city parks. Expanded parks and green spaces in our district: After years of disinvestment, Alexa secured funding for District 38 to renovate parks and green spaces in our community, including Rainbow Playground and Martin Luther Park. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term : Fight for full enforcement of Local Law 97. More than two-thirds of New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings. Local Law 97 is the city’s major climate legislation that requires large buildings to reduce their emissions. While corporate politicians like Eric Adams try to undermine the legislation, Alexa will work with the City Council to ensure the city stays on track to meet its life-saving climate goals. Protect New Yorkers from extreme heat. Each year, 350 New Yorkers die from extreme heat, with more deaths on the line as the planet gets hotter. The health risks associated with extreme heat underscore the urgency of reversing austerity budgeting for our parks and investing in tree cover and other forms of life-saving shade, hiring more lifeguards and expanding hours at our city’s pools, investing in the city’s Cooling Assistance Benefit program and expand eligibility for free fans and air conditioners, and expanding cooling centers and the city’s Cool Streets programs.

Local Law 97 is the city’s major climate legislation that requires large buildings to reduce their emissions. While corporate politicians like Eric Adams try to undermine the legislation, Alexa will work with the City Council to ensure the city stays on track to meet its life-saving climate goals.

Protect New Yorkers from extreme heat. Each year, 350 New Yorkers die from extreme heat, with more deaths on the line as the planet gets hotter. The health risks associated with extreme heat underscore the urgency of reversing austerity budgeting for our parks and investing in tree cover and other forms of life-saving shade, hiring more lifeguards and expanding hours at our city’s pools, investing in the city’s Cooling Assistance Benefit program and expand eligibility for free fans and air conditioners, and expanding cooling centers and the city’s Cool Streets programs.

No. 41-A Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2082/A.3474 to create the New York State Working Families Tax Credit. By Council Members Avilés, Hanif, Bottcher, Nurse, Abreu, Ayala, Gennaro, Cabán, Sanchez, Ossé, Williams, Menin, Salaam, Farías, Louis, Brewer, Hudson, Brannan, Narcisse, De La Rosa, Won, Rivera, Banks, Joseph and Gutiérrez Whereas,  According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the child tax credit was created by the Taxpayer Relief Act (TRA) of 1997 and made available to middle-income families with children to help ease the financial burdens associated with raising a family; and Whereas, According to the CRS, through a series of legislative changes, the eligibility for the child tax credit has expanded to both lower- and higher-income families with the credit having increased for most recipients; and Whereas, Initially, the TRA enacted a nonrefundable credit of $400 per child, which was increased in 1998 to $500 per child, and made available to middle-income families with dependent children under 17 years of age; and Whereas, In 2001 the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) temporarily increased the per-child credit amount to $600 (for 2001-2004) with scheduled increases thereafter to a maximum of $1,000 per child by 2010; and Whereas, The EGTRRA temporarily made the tax credit available to lower-income taxpayers as a refundable tax credit, specifically for those with little to no income tax liability enabling them to receive all or part of the additional child tax credit (ACTC): and Whereas,  Due to the accelerations in the EGTRRA, by 2004, the tax credit of $1,000 per child had phased in lower income families at 15 percent of their earned income above $10,000; and Whereas, In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) reduced the refund threshold to $3,000 per taxpayer, enabling low-income taxpayers with earned income over $3,000 for the refundable credit, and calculated 15 percent of their earned income over $3,000 up to the maximum credit of $1,000 per child; and Whereas, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 increased the maximum child tax credit amount to $2,000 per child while modifying the credit formula for low-income families to 15 percent of earned income over $2,500, not to exceed $1,400 per child, and increased the income level at which the credit began to phase out to $400,000 for married joint filers and $200,000 for single head of household filers; and Whereas, From 2018 to 2025, the TCJA created a temporary $500 per dependent nonrefundable credit for dependents not eligible for the child tax credit scheduled to be in effect from 2018 to 2025; and Whereas, The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) made several changes to the child tax credit, which included making the credit fully refundable so low-income families could receive the maximum amount of the credit; and Whereas, The ARPA increased the maximum credit to $3,600 for children 0-5 years old and $3,000 for children 6-17 years old, thereby delivering 50 percent of the credit in advance payments in 2021 with the remaining 50 percent to be claimed on a 2021 tax return; and Whereas, According to the U.S. Census Bureau Supplemental Poverty Measure, the expanded child tax credit successfully lifted 2.9 million children out of poverty in 2021; and Whereas, As a result of the ARPA, in 2021, 3,513,000 children and 910,000 workers in New York state benefited from the child tax credit; and Whereas, Despite reducing the level of child poverty to a record low in 2021, the child tax credit program was not renewed and has been discontinued by the federal government; and Whereas, According to a December 2022 report by New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, 14 percent of New Yorkers, or 2.7 million people, live in poverty, which exceeds the national average of 12.8 percent; and Whereas, a May 2024 report on child poverty, also by the New York State Comptroller, found that 1 in 5 children in New York City lived in poverty in 2022, which is 5.6 percentage points higher than and the rate adults; and Whereas, S.2082, introduced by New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes and pending in the State Senate, and companion bill A.3474, sponsored by New York State Assembly Member Andrew Hevesi and pending in the State Assembly, would create the New York State Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) establishing a tax credit to a maximum of $1,500 per child while eliminating the cap on the number of children eligible to receive a credit, and providing a $500 credit per child regardless of income, and be paid quarterly to families rather than once a year; and Whereas, It is estimated that S.2082/A.3474 would result in decreased poverty by offsetting the loss of support to New York children who benefited from the WFTC child tax credit; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2082/A.3474, to create the New York State Working Families Tax Credit.

Last name: Hanif E-mail: District39@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/ Notes: District 39 - Council Member - Democrat - Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Waterfront, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington - Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard.

Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother. For nearly a decade, Sandy has been working in Bushwick and supporting projects in East New York that empower women and young people of color. Most of her work has been dedicated to ending white supremacy, fighting for a transition away from the fossil fuel economy, and demanding our public agencies and servants are accountable to the people, not corporations.  Through years of strong community partnerships and collaborations, Sandy has built neighborhood institutions that directly strengthen grassroots movements in Bushwick and East New York. She has committed her life to addressing issues through direct interventions and solutions including building farms in our food deserts, creating jobs where we have high unemployment, and helping develop community space where it was scarce.  As the new City Council Member, she will fight to keep people in their homes, create protections for our immigrant neighbors, and help to build a healthy, sustainable future.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is a steadfast advocate for truly affordable housing, worker rights, universal access to after school programs, and environmental sustainability.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is a steadfast advocate for truly affordable housing, worker rights, universal access to after school programs, and environmental sustainability.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

Last name: Ayala E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence. She is a partner with the people, and a strong voice and aggressive champion for what she believes in.  Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

Last name: De La Rosa E-mail: District10@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/carmen-de-la-rosa/ Notes: District 10 - Council Member - Democrat - Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill - Carmen De La Rosa immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up in Inwood where she has lived her entire life. Her advocacy and passion for justice are deeply influenced by her roots. She has listened and advocated for the most vulnerable, even before she started her career in government.  In November 2016, Carmen was elected to represent her community as the State Assembly Member of the 72nd District. Since her first day in office, Carmen has fought against racism, xenophobia and economic injustice.  As a progressive Democrat, Carmen has fought for criminal justice reform, workers’ rights, truly affordable housing and protections for tenants, climate justice, taxing the wealthy, LGBTIA rights, and many other consequential social justice policies.  She successfully negotiated and passed the New York State DREAM ACT and the first in the nation Excluded Workers Fund (EWF) at $2.1 Billion. As the member of the Assembly representing the district with the highest number of rent-stabilized apartments, Carmen actively participated in passing the strongest tenant protection laws in a generation.  On June 22nd, 2021, Carmen was victorious in the Democratic primary and subsequently won the general election on November 2nd, becoming the first Dominican woman elected to represent District 10 at City Hall.  Carmen will fight to make sure that the needs of our community are at the forefront. She will fight to protect our community from irresponsible development and displacement, dismantle fundamental flaws in our criminal justice system, expand our social safety nets, fix our broken education system, and protect frontline workers and vulnerable small businesses.  Carmen De La Rosa is committed to building a community-driven government rooted in the principles of co-governance and participatory democracy. Working alongside the community she is committed to improving the lives of residents in the community.  Carmen is proudly Mia’s Mom and along with her husband Jose, they are raising their daughter in the community where her parents also reside. As a proud product of uptown, Carmen looks forward to continuing to serve the community she loves and the community that helped raise her.

A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began.

After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

Lincoln spent most of his career as a public servant in New York City government, where he fought hard to deliver for those New Yorkers who always seem to be overlooked by our elected officials. He designed and implemented programs like IDNYC – providing the first U.S. government issued photo identification for many of our city’s 600,000 undocumented residents and negotiated the creation of safe, affordable bank accounts that have benefited thousands of “unbanked” New Yorkers. Lincoln formerly served as Executive Director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit coalition of community based organizations, union training funds, and community colleges that provide job training and job placement services to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers annually. And over a decade ago, Lincoln helped form New Kings Democrats, an organization dedicated to bringing transparency, accountability, and integrity to Brooklyn politics.  Understanding what our district needs is integral to how Lincoln works—he wants to tackle the affordability crisis, revitalize small businesses, and deliver solutions to climate change. He ran for office because he’s committed to being a problem solver for residents and showing up on every issue, big and small.  Lincoln grew up in Brooklyn Heights and lives in Greenpoint with his partner. He graduated from Brown University and attended neighborhood schools.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Alexa was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and grew up in East New York, Brooklyn.  Alexa’s path has been inspired by her mother Isabel, a brave, vivacious and loving woman who rebuilt their lives after the loss of her father to gun violence. Isabel used her own life experiences to help others suffering from poverty, incarceration and substance abuse disorder. Before her election to City Council, Alexa’s career spanned almost three decades in the not-for-profit and philanthropic sectors. Most recently, Alexa served as Program Director at the Scherman Foundation, where she supported local and national social justice organizations that included work to protect human rights, autonomy, and dignity of all people. She has supported state and national efforts to reduce the incarceration of juveniles and adults, fought discrimination across multiple government systems, and supported the empowerment of marginalized communities.  For nearly a decade, Alexa also served as PTA President at PS 172, partnering with parents, staff and students to improve academic and recreational programs. She championed language access and an inclusive and supportive community for all. She has had the privilege of serving on multiple local and national nonprofit boards including Brooklyn Community Board 7 and as Chair of the NYC Youth Board.  Alexa is a proud alumna of A Better Chance and the National Urban Fellows.

Last name: Brewer E-mail: District6@council.nyc.gov Web site: http://council.nyc.gov/d6/html/members/home.shtml Notes: District 6 - Council Member - Democrat ~ Central Park, Lincoln Square, Upper West Side, Clinton - Gale A. Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.  As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.  For many years, Gale Brewer has taught at CUNY and Barnard College.  Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College. She lives with her husband Cal Snyder, and they have a grown son. In the past, she had many foster children.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers.

Christopher went on to work as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before learning about local politics and eventually running for City Council. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers. District 1 - Council Member - Democrat - Battery Park City, Civic Center, Chinatown, Financial District, Little Italy, the Lower East Side, NoHo, SoHo, South Street Seaport, South Village, TriBeCa & Washington Square - Christopher Marte was born and raised in the Lower East Side, where his dad owned a bodega. When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. He decided to take action. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA while the state refused to fund their repairs. He volunteered at the Bowery Mission as he saw more and more affordable apartments get converted into luxury condos. It was through doing this work that he learned so many of our problems came from the same source. We had elected officials who lined their pockets with real estate money and who prioritized political gain over people. So he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He was able to bring together neighbors who lived only a quarter mile away from each other, but had never had a reason to work together before.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.

Mercedes’ commitment to family and community is based on a strong set of values passed on to her by her immigrant parents. Uniquely qualified and specially prepared, Mercedes has sought to bring all people – regardless of class, racial background, economic status, sexual orientation or social position into what she calls “the Family of People.”  As an advocate for her community, Mercedes has tirelessly worked to empower her neighborhood holistically. In order to excel on all levels, Mercedes works to support all families in our community, helping them understand how local government can work for them, and what they can do together to improve the quality of lives of all.  For decades, much of Mercedes focus has been connecting with different groups of young people, encouraging them to get involves by giving back to her community as young leaders in various aspects. Most recently she has partnered with young people at marches for social justice, census outreach, and food and facemask giveaways during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, Mercedes has fiercely worked to improve the quality of healthcare and its delivery, not only in Brooklyn, but overseas as well. Most recently, Mercedes is worked as a re-entry nurse at Paul J. Cooper Center for Human Services, Inc. where she provides, and addresses outpatient chemical dependency treatment for adult alcohol & drug abusers. She has also served as the general administrator of two different private clinics, MJC & Brooklyn Gastro.  Mercedes is a consensus builder and has worked and partnered with a number of local elected leaders to bring much-needed resources to the district. Mercedes well-rounded personality lends itself to community leadership, and public service.  Mercedes Narcisse has been recognized and honored by many organizations and associations for her long record and history of outstanding community service. In 2008, she was the sole recipient of the “Corporate Award” presented by the New York State Association of Black & Puerto Rican Legislators, Inc. This award recognized her vast contributions to the growth and development of minority and women-owned businesses in New York State. Mercedes has demonstrated that a focused combination of hard-work, honesty, integrity and a sense of community buy-in is the formula for achieving success.  On November 2, 2021, Mercedes was victorious in the General Election and is now the Council Member for the 46th Council District in Brooklyn.

For more than a decade, she has worked for the well-being of working families, women, seniors, and the youth of New York City Council District 41. Her passion for the people of her district is displayed through her focus on legislation that reflects core community values which include: equality, fairness and non-discrimination in the workplace.  Local Law 33 of 2015, authored by Council Member Mealy, entrusted the NYC Commission on Human Rights with pursuing employment discrimination investigations. This law ensured that constituents seeking jobs across the city truly have a fair shot during the job application process. In conjunction with Local Law 33, Mealy also authored Local Law 29 of 2015, which ensures that the Commission on Human Rights regularly reports its work combating unlawful discriminatory practices.  As the former Chair of the Committee on Contracts, Mealy used her power over the City’s annual multi-billion dollar contracting budget to lift up Minority and Women-owned Businesses (MWBEs). She contributed to the passing of Local Law 1 of 2013, a pivotal MWBE legislation that helped underpin the MWBE program that the city still offers today. Her leadership has been prominent in later New York State and City Council legislation that adjusted procurement rules to allow for MWBEs to have real pathways to secure government contracts. Focusing on the challenges MWBEs has face ensures that small businesses across New York City, and in District 41, realize opportunities to secure the stability and growth that a city contract secures.  Using her expertise in navigating the city’s departments, Council Member Mealy secured a roster of results for her community. From Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of Buildings to the Department for the Aging and the Department of Youth and Community Development, Mealy has worked directly with the alphabet soup of City agencies that make decisions that impact daily lives of local constituents. The number of community resources that include the placements of senior programs, community workshops, funding for community-based organizations have all benefitted from her guidance and experience.  Council Member Mealy is truly BACK and BETTER THAN EVER.

Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

As a dedicated single teen mother, she works hard to create a sustainable future for her child and for all children and families who live in under-resourced neighborhoods.  Althea began her career in civic service more than 15 years ago working for non-profit agencies and community centers that focused on giving a voice to the most vulnerable populations. She organized voting rights information sessions, led strategy workshops to address gang policing and created annual youth forums and community celebrations to bridge relationships between residents and neighborhood partners. Each step of the way, Althea’s natural leadership and organizing skills were honed while advocating for families, seniors, young adults and students on important issues, while identifying and allocating much needed resources to neighborhoods of the Bronx.  Althea will continue her life’s work – of motivating and inspiring, leading with passion and advocating for the community – as a proud member of the City Council representing the great residents of City Council District 16.

Gennaro is a Democratic member of the New York City Council, where he represents the 24th Council District and chairs the Council’s Committee on Environmental Protection, Resiliency & Waterfronts. Gennaro served his first terms from 2002 to 2013.  Although most closely associated with nationally-acclaimed environmental lawmaking, Gennaro authored more than 50 laws covering many issues, including increasing protections for women against domestic violence, protecting consumers from unscrupulous bankruptcy counselors, and in 2013, he authored and passed a law that raises the age of sale of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21, known as the “Tobacco 21” law, the first-in-the-nation law of its kind. In 2020, Tobacco 21 was adopted as national policy. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine states that the Tobacco 21 movement has saved “countless lives” across the United States.  Since his return to the City Council in 2021, Gennaro has continued to be the guiding hand of environmental policy in New York City. The main focus of his work has been on holding the city accountable to its stated emissions goals and pushing for greater storm resiliency in the face of more frequent superstorms. He has also been one of the strongest voices on the council calling on the state to institute a dangerousness standard for the courts in order to stem the rising tide of crimes the city is facing.

No. 6-A Tenant education and outreach on residential vacate orders due to damage caused by fires.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

Gennaro is a Democratic member of the New York City Council, where he represents the 24th Council District and chairs the Council’s Committee on Environmental Protection, Resiliency & Waterfronts. Gennaro served his first terms from 2002 to 2013.  Although most closely associated with nationally-acclaimed environmental lawmaking, Gennaro authored more than 50 laws covering many issues, including increasing protections for women against domestic violence, protecting consumers from unscrupulous bankruptcy counselors, and in 2013, he authored and passed a law that raises the age of sale of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21, known as the “Tobacco 21” law, the first-in-the-nation law of its kind. In 2020, Tobacco 21 was adopted as national policy. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine states that the Tobacco 21 movement has saved “countless lives” across the United States.  Since his return to the City Council in 2021, Gennaro has continued to be the guiding hand of environmental policy in New York City. The main focus of his work has been on holding the city accountable to its stated emissions goals and pushing for greater storm resiliency in the face of more frequent superstorms. He has also been one of the strongest voices on the council calling on the state to institute a dangerousness standard for the courts in order to stem the rising tide of crimes the city is facing.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

Last name: Ayala E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence.

Last name: Last name: Ayala Ayala E-mail: E-mail: DAyala@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/district-8/ Notes: Notes: District 8 - Deputy Speaker/Council Member - Democrat - El Barrio/East Harlem, Mott Haven, Highbridge, Concourse, Longwood, Port Morris -  Diana Ayala has worked for nearly two decades serving the people of the 8th District in social service agencies and government, and is a passionate advocate on issues including housing, gun violence, and senior services.  Diana was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York City with her family as a child. Growing up in public housing after a time in the shelter system, she experienced numerous challenges that would help give her a unique voice and perspective in government and politics, and drive her passion for public service.  As a teenage mom-to-be, the father of Diana’s son was shot and killed in a senseless shooting, after which she returned to shelter. She later entered into a new relationship that proved abusive. In the face of these challenges, she found the personal strength to start her life over, enrolling in school and receiving her associate’s degree in Human Services from Bronx Community College.  She worked as a senior center director in East Harlem for seven years, and later joined the team for Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito as Constituent Services Director, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of Staff.  In her current capacity, Diana has been instrumental in crafting legislation that has become law, from expanding tenants’ rights to cracking down on the sale of synthetic marijuana (K2). Diana has worked hand-in-hand with constituents to address issues ranging from housing, homelessness and mental health, to schools, immigration, and gun violence. She is a partner with the people, and a strong voice and aggressive champion for what she believes in.  Diana lives in East Harlem with her life partner, Frankie. She has four children and three grandchildren, and also lives with two rescued dogs and three cats.

Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.  As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.  For many years, Gale Brewer has taught at CUNY and Barnard College.  Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College. She lives with her husband Cal Snyder, and they have a grown son. In the past, she had many foster children.

Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.  Shahana attended PS 230 in Kensington and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies at Brooklyn College. She lives in Kensington with her cat, Babe.

He is the first Latino to represent the district.  Shaun was born and raised in Northern Manhattan, where his family experienced good times and bad. When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is a steadfast advocate for truly affordable housing, worker rights, universal access to after school programs, and environmental sustainability.  Prior to his election, Council Member Abreu worked for the New York Legal Assistance Group, the National Labor Review Board, and the Natural Resource Defense Council. He holds a B.A. from Columbia University and a J.D. from Tulane Law School.

When he was a child, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. But the community was there for him. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own.  Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is a steadfast advocate for truly affordable housing, worker rights, universal access to after school programs, and environmental sustainability.  Prior to his election, Council Member Abreu worked for the New York Legal Assistance Group, the National Labor Review Board, and the Natural Resource Defense Council. He holds a B.A. from Columbia University and a J.D. from Tulane Law School.

Mercedes’ commitment to family and community is based on a strong set of values passed on to her by her immigrant parents. Uniquely qualified and specially prepared, Mercedes has sought to bring all people – regardless of class, racial background, economic status, sexual orientation or social position into what she calls “the Family of People.”  As an advocate for her community, Mercedes has tirelessly worked to empower her neighborhood holistically. In order to excel on all levels, Mercedes works to support all families in our community, helping them understand how local government can work for them, and what they can do together to improve the quality of lives of all.  For decades, much of Mercedes focus has been connecting with different groups of young people, encouraging them to get involves by giving back to her community as young leaders in various aspects. Most recently she has partnered with young people at marches for social justice, census outreach, and food and facemask giveaways during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, Mercedes has fiercely worked to improve the quality of healthcare and its delivery, not only in Brooklyn, but overseas as well. Most recently, Mercedes is worked as a re-entry nurse at Paul J. Cooper Center for Human Services, Inc. where she provides, and addresses outpatient chemical dependency treatment for adult alcohol & drug abusers. She has also served as the general administrator of two different private clinics, MJC & Brooklyn Gastro.  Mercedes is a consensus builder and has worked and partnered with a number of local elected leaders to bring much-needed resources to the district. Mercedes well-rounded personality lends itself to community leadership, and public service.  Mercedes Narcisse has been recognized and honored by many organizations and associations for her long record and history of outstanding community service. In 2008, she was the sole recipient of the “Corporate Award” presented by the New York State Association of Black & Puerto Rican Legislators, Inc. This award recognized her vast contributions to the growth and development of minority and women-owned businesses in New York State. Mercedes has demonstrated that a focused combination of hard-work, honesty, integrity and a sense of community buy-in is the formula for achieving success.  On November 2, 2021, Mercedes was victorious in the General Election and is now the Council Member for the 46th Council District in Brooklyn.

Last name: Brannan E-mail: AskJB@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/justin-brannan/ Notes: District 47 - Council Member - Democrat - Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach - Council Member Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a record salesman and early childhood educator. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism at Fordham, before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – traveling to over fifty countries across five continents.  While working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor Council Member Gentile and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Education where he helped oversee the expansion of Universal Pre-K.  A longtime believer in the importance of making government work efficiently to create opportunities for working and middle class families, Brannan was elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn’s 43rd Council District. With too many people feeling that government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Council Member Brannan has vowed to always fight for the “little guy.”  The 43rd Council District might be far from the soaring skyscrapers and posh penthouses that many associate with New York City, but Brannan knows that his district is the backbone of the City and deserves the same respect, resources and results as everyone else. As Council Member, he’s made it his mission to make life just a little bit easier for everyone who calls the 43rd District their home.  Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his wife Leigh, an artist, educator, and small business owner.

Justin lives in Bay Ridge with his wife Leigh, an artist, educator, and small business owner. District 47 - Council Member - Democrat - Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach - Council Member Justin Brannan was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a record salesman and early childhood educator. After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism at Fordham, before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – traveling to over fifty countries across five continents.  While working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor Council Member Gentile and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Education where he helped oversee the expansion of Universal Pre-K.  A longtime believer in the importance of making government work efficiently to create opportunities for working and middle class families, Brannan was elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn’s 43rd Council District.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

Amanda is a lifelong Bronxite, born and raised in Soundview as a second-generation Afro-Latina of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent. She is a proud product of local schools and community institutions. Growing up she attended P.S. 69X and Holy Cross School, and spent after-school hours learning to dance and summers at camp in Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club. A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began. Soon after graduate school, she started her career by fighting voter suppression and mobilizing Black and Latino communities for President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Council Member Farías’ extensive experience includes working for the New York City Council from 2013 to 2017 in several different capacities, including Director of Special Projects, managing the Women’s Caucus and a districtwide Participatory Budgeting process. After her time in the Council, Amanda joined The Consortium for Worker Education as an Assistant Director in 2017, to manage workforce development programming in the Bronx. Amanda’s programming and partnerships with CUNY, labor unions, and local community-based organizations have allowed her to create new opportunities for young Bronxites to access trade jobs. During this time she also served as the New York State Coordinator for New American Leaders and as the Co-Founder of Women of Color for Progress. Through her work with these organizations, Amanda created a pipeline for more women to be elected to office through increased civic engagement and opportunities in electoral politics.  During the height of the pandemic Amanda became active in mutual aid and feels most in her element when in community. Hosting food distributions for neighbors has been at the core of her service to continue the fight against food insecurity and The Bronx being the unhealthiest county in NYS.  She was elected as the Council Member of the 18th district in 2021. Amanda currently resides in Parkchester with her dog and cat.

The Exonerated Five spent between seven to 13 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit, until their sentences were overturned in 2002. Since then, they have received a multi-million dollar settlement from the city of New York for its injustice and have been profiled in award-winning films, including The Central Park Five documentary from Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon and most recently the Emmy award-winning Netflix limited series When They See Us, written and directed by Ava DuVernay.  Over the past two decades, Yusef has become a family man, father, poet, activist and inspirational speaker. He continues to utilize his platform to share his story with others and educate the public about the impact of mass incarceration and police brutality rooted in our justice system. He regularly advocates for criminal justice reform, prison reform and the abolition of juvenile solitary confinement and capital punishment.  Yusef was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (2014) and is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama (2016). More recently has shared his story and stance on current issues on CNN, MSNBC, REVOLT TV, NPR Atlanta, FOX and more. He authored his memoir Better, Not Bitter and is the co-author of Punching the Air.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education.

Nantasha M.  Last name: Last name: Williams Williams E-mail: E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

He is a lifelong Brooklyn resident who was born and raised in the neighborhood of East New York.  The son of an immigrant mother from Trinidad and Tobago and a hardworking father from Houston Texas, Chris grew up in an entrepreneurial and labor focused household, where he learned the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and respect for others. As a true community public servant, Chris has always believed in giving back to the community that raised him.  From his first job at the local Police Athletic League as an education group leader and adolescent coordinator, to running after school and summer youth programs for the East New York Local Development Corporation, providing services to hundreds of area youth, Chris has always centered his work around strengthening his community.  Seeing the community through a grassroots lens, Chris believes conditions could be made better by building community-based power through partnership and collaboration while identifying ways to amplify the voices of the traditionally unheard.  It has always been Chris’ philosophy that strong advocacy is essential when fighting for the needs of the community. Chris is a results-oriented community and tenant organizer and a man of action with a proven record of leveraging relationships to achieve wins for his community.  Chris has successfully organized residents of Starrett City to prevent a proposed significant rent increase, organized seniors to prevent the closure of Pink Houses’ Theresa Moore Senior Center and the Penn Wortman Senior Center, preserving vital services for area seniors.  He also organized community members and worked with local elected officials to prevent the closure of the community’s NYPD Community Center.  Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

Chris has fought for repairs, clean drinking water, restoration of gas services, heat, and other serious quality of life issues in several NYCHA buildings and has worked with area homeowners and other community residents as part of the East New York Coalition to prevent the creation of additional shelters within the East New York Community.  Where protecting the rights of the community is concerned, there isn’t a fight Chris won’t take on.  Chris has built on this philosophy of building community by founding or co-founding effective community-based programs including the East New York United Concerned Citizens Inc., an anti-poverty organization that provided senior and youth services to thousands of residents of East New York and the surrounding community.  The organization provided housing advocacy, youth mentoring, support services for seniors, and a youth scholarship fund.  Chris was also the co-founder of the East New York collaborative, along with Rabbi Avrohom Hecht and then community activist Nikki Lucas, an organization focused on building community through collaboration.  His public service has included serving as the President of the 75th Precinct Council where he has merged his advocacy and love for his community with his efforts to improve police community relations in an area with a history of over policing.  Chris revitalized the Van Siclen Block Association, where he served as the president, leading the organization in the production of various events and initiatives including recreational and social events that have built cohesion on the block and addressed numerous quality of life issues, through block clean ups, snow removal, green thumb planting initiatives, graffiti removal, and public art beautification initiatives.  Additionally, Chris is a former member of Community Board 5 where he has served as the co-chair of the Aging, Transportation, and Education committees, as well as serving as a member of the Executive Committee as the Sergeant at Arms.  Chris also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Boulevard Houses Nursery Day Care where he oversaw several City Contracts of more than $1 million.  Chris also wrote the green jobs curriculum and performed community outreach for the Italian American Civil Rights Group based in Starrett City and East New York.  Chris believes in maintaining a strong spiritual and educational foundation.  A member of East New York’s Changing Lives Christian Center since 2008, Chris attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice building on the education he received while attending PS 213, PS 273, and Anointed Minds Christian Academy, all in East New York, before graduating from Leadership Public Service High School in Manhattan.  Councilmember Banks is a proud resident of East New York which he commits to making bigger, better, and brighter through service.

For nearly a decade, Jennifer has been deeply entrenched in the issues and struggles of the Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Ridgewood families she seeks to represent. Born and raised in Queens to parents who emigrated from Colombia in the 1980s, Jennifer grew up in a one bedroom apartment with her family in an immigrant rich community and attended local public schools all her life. Jennifer graduated from SUNY Albany with a B.A. in Political Science.  An advocate from a young age, Jennifer accompanied her mom, who worked as a domestic worker for over twenty years, to cleaning jobs to interpret and negotiate her wages. When she was ten years old, her father became disabled and it was Jennifer who would spend hours on the phone and write letters to insurance companies to ensure her family had the means to make rent. Jennifer began working as a community organizer in Williamsburg, working directly with residents on tenant and anti-eviction issues. It was here that she gained a deep respect for the existing organizing efforts to preserve crucial services in communities, the dire need for affordable housing, environmental justice, and equity in education.  As the Chief of Staff to City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, Jennifer implemented greater transparency and access for constituents by leading 8 cycles of Participatory Budgeting which led to over $5 Million of investments to public spaces like schools, streets, parks, and NYCHA. Jennifer has also been instrumental in leading the office’s legislative and constituent services operations. She played a leading role in passing the Right to Know Act, which brought transparency to police stops, as well as the Waste Equity Bill, which reduced the amount of trash trucks and their associated pollution in North Brooklyn. She has served as the office’s liaison in negotiating the extension of the Nuestros Niños daycare and the public actions related to this daycare and Small World Daycare; and orchestrated multiple annual community events.  Jennifer was elected to represent Council District 34- which include the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens in November of 2021. She welcomed the birth of her first child in the same month and lives in Bushwick with her family. As the incoming Council Member she looks forward to working with the diverse constituency of her district to institute community based solutions, institute legislative and budget transparency at the Council, and strengthen our communities for all.

She has served as Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs and Commissioner of Media and Entertainment. She previously served as a Columbia adjunct professor teaching on city and state government, preemption and home rule.  The daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Julie is a third-generation New Yorker who lives in Yorkville with her husband and her children.  As the 2020 New York City Census Director, Julie led a historically successful effort as New York City gained more population than any city in America. Her leadership was responsible for ensuring that New York City receives its fair share of over $1.5 trillion in federal funding for public schools, affordable housing, healthcare, infrastructure, and other vital programs. She also successfully fought attempts by the Trump Administration to undercount immigrant communities and represented the city as the Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel at the NYC Law Department on the citizenship census case and other legal matters. Under her leadership, New York City surpassed expectations and actually had 4 of the top 5 counties in America in terms of exceeding census expectations of population growth. Julie achieved this historic census success despite a global pandemic and efforts from the Trump Administration to sabotage the count.  Julie previously served as the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, where she reinvigorated the agency by increasing consumer restitution by 70 percent, instituting 25 reforms to lower fines on small businesses where there was no consumer harm, implementing the Paid Sick Leave Law, and launching trailblazing legal investigations into for-profit colleges, debt collectors, banks, predatory lenders and other industries preying on New Yorkers. She launched a new Earned Income Tax Credit initiative that resulted in over $260 million being returned to low-income New Yorkers. Julie created a new city initiative to seed over 13,000 kindergarteners with a college savings account and chaired the board of New York City Kids Rise, a not-for-profit organization she helped to create charged with implementing this program which has now been adopted citywide.  Julie also previously served as Commissioner of Media and Entertainment where she implemented dozens of initiatives to increase gender equity. Faced with industries that were not diversified and lacked gender equity, Julie launched new programs to increase women’s representation and opportunities in film, TV, theater, and the music industry such as the first-ever women’s film fund, job training programs to increase gender equity in the film, theater, TV and music industries and a slate of new women’s programming on the city’s TV channels. These programs have been held up as a national model and utilized as a paradigm for other cities. She also increased film and TV production to historic heights resulting in thousands of jobs for working families. Julie negotiated the historic deal to bring the Grammy Awards back to New York in 2017, resulting in a $200 million economic benefit for New York City.  Before becoming a Commissioner, Julie served as a seven-year Chair of Manhattan Community Board 1 and is widely credited with helping to lead Lower Manhattan’s resurgence after 9/11. Several weeks after her small business was badly damaged on 9/11, she founded the not-for-profit organization Wall Street Rising, which focused on the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan for residents and small businesses and developed it into an organization with over 30,000 members. As Chairperson of Community Board 1, she facilitated the building of three new schools including the city’s first green school, new parks, and affordable housing, and led the charge in favor of the Islamic Cultural Center and freedom of religion. Additionally, Julie fought for and won $150 million for downtown community needs from a battle with Con Edison as part of her work with Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Julie has also successfully implemented legislation at the city and state level, including winning a two-year fight to mandate life-saving epi-pens on all ambulances statewide.  Prior to her career in public service, Julie practiced law as a regulatory and litigation attorney. She has served on the board of the Women’s Campaign Fund, where she helped launch She Should Run, a nationwide initiative that has encouraged thousands of women to run for elected office, and served on the board of Eleanor’s Legacy, an organization in New York focused on electing more Democratic women statewide. In addition, she has served on the board of trustees of Columbia University, the Downtown Hospital, the Municipal Arts Society, and on the boards of Vera Institute of Justice’s Reform Leadership Council, the September 11th Memorial Foundation and the WTC Performing Arts Center.  She received her undergraduate degree from Columbia University magna cum laude. She received her law degree from Northwestern University School of Law. She serves on the National Advisory Board for Public Service at Harvard University.  Julie has been recognized as a Women’s Campaign Fund Rising Star, Citizen Union’s Civic Leader, City and State’s “40 Under 40,” “Power 100 Women,” and “Top 25 Women in Public Service.” She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including Columbia University’s John Jay award and the League of Conservation Voters Public Service award. She has served as a frequent national commentator on law and politics and has appeared nationally on CNN, The Today Show, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and other outlets and previously hosted and co-produced a local NBC cable news show focused on politics and law.

Julie previously served as the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, where she reinvigorated the agency by increasing consumer restitution by 70 percent, instituting 25 reforms to lower fines on small businesses where there was no consumer harm, implementing the Paid Sick Leave Law, and launching trailblazing legal investigations into for-profit colleges, debt collectors, banks, predatory lenders and other industries preying on New Yorkers. She launched a new Earned Income Tax Credit initiative that resulted in over $260 million being returned to low-income New Yorkers. Julie created a new city initiative to seed over 13,000 kindergarteners with a college savings account and chaired the board of New York City Kids Rise, a not-for-profit organization she helped to create charged with implementing this program which has now been adopted citywide.  Julie also previously served as Commissioner of Media and Entertainment where she implemented dozens of initiatives to increase gender equity. Faced with industries that were not diversified and lacked gender equity, Julie launched new programs to increase women’s representation and opportunities in film, TV, theater, and the music industry such as the first-ever women’s film fund, job training programs to increase gender equity in the film, theater, TV and music industries and a slate of new women’s programming on the city’s TV channels. These programs have been held up as a national model and utilized as a paradigm for other cities. She also increased film and TV production to historic heights resulting in thousands of jobs for working families. Julie negotiated the historic deal to bring the Grammy Awards back to New York in 2017, resulting in a $200 million economic benefit for New York City.  Before becoming a Commissioner, Julie served as a seven-year Chair of Manhattan Community Board 1 and is widely credited with helping to lead Lower Manhattan’s resurgence after 9/11. Several weeks after her small business was badly damaged on 9/11, she founded the not-for-profit organization Wall Street Rising, which focused on the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan for residents and small businesses and developed it into an organization with over 30,000 members. As Chairperson of Community Board 1, she facilitated the building of three new schools including the city’s first green school, new parks, and affordable housing, and led the charge in favor of the Islamic Cultural Center and freedom of religion. Additionally, Julie fought for and won $150 million for downtown community needs from a battle with Con Edison as part of her work with Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Julie has also successfully implemented legislation at the city and state level, including winning a two-year fight to mandate life-saving epi-pens on all ambulances statewide.  Prior to her career in public service, Julie practiced law as a regulatory and litigation attorney. She has served on the board of the Women’s Campaign Fund, where she helped launch She Should Run, a nationwide initiative that has encouraged thousands of women to run for elected office, and served on the board of Eleanor’s Legacy, an organization in New York focused on electing more Democratic women statewide. In addition, she has served on the board of trustees of Columbia University, the Downtown Hospital, the Municipal Arts Society, and on the boards of Vera Institute of Justice’s Reform Leadership Council, the September 11th Memorial Foundation and the WTC Performing Arts Center.  She received her undergraduate degree from Columbia University magna cum laude. She received her law degree from Northwestern University School of Law. She serves on the National Advisory Board for Public Service at Harvard University.  Julie has been recognized as a Women’s Campaign Fund Rising Star, Citizen Union’s Civic Leader, City and State’s “40 Under 40,” “Power 100 Women,” and “Top 25 Women in Public Service.” She has also been the recipient of numerous awards including Columbia University’s John Jay award and the League of Conservation Voters Public Service award. She has served as a frequent national commentator on law and politics and has appeared nationally on CNN, The Today Show, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and other outlets and previously hosted and co-produced a local NBC cable news show focused on politics and law.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA).

Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Last name: Bottcher E-mail: District3@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/erik-bottcher/ Notes: District 3 - Council Member  - Democrat ~ Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Greenwich Village, West SoHo, Hudson Square, Times Square, Garment District, Flatiron, Upper West Side - Erik Bottcher is a dedicated public servant and activist who has devoted his life to progressive causes and to the betterment of the community he loves. In 2021, he was elected to represent City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Flatiron, Hudson Square, Times Square, the Theater District, the Garment District and Columbus Circle.  Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality.  Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaision in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage.  In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Erik has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more.  When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik built an expansive volunteer network in his community that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors, and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments, and organized weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.  Erik believes that our government should be effective, innovative, inclusive, and that it must work for the people, not special interests. Erik knows that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead.

District 3 - Council Member  - Democrat ~ Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Greenwich Village, West SoHo, Hudson Square, Times Square, Garment District, Flatiron, Upper West Side - Erik Bottcher is a dedicated public servant and activist who has devoted his life to progressive causes and to the betterment of the community he loves. In 2021, he was elected to represent City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Flatiron, Hudson Square, Times Square, the Theater District, the Garment District and Columbus Circle.  Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality.  Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaision in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage.  In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Erik has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more.  When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik built an expansive volunteer network in his community that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors, and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments, and organized weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.  Erik believes that our government should be effective, innovative, inclusive, and that it must work for the people, not special interests. Erik knows that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School. She lives in Astoria with her two rescue dogs, Natalie and Coltrane.

Ossé Amended and Coupled on GO Requiring the administration for children’s services to report annually on the number and placement of foster youth. Introduction This bill would require expansion of the foster youth experience survey that the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is required to distribute annually to foster youth, by requiring surveying foster youth  as to their LGBTQIA+ and racial identities, and requiring ACS to report annually on such responses as they relate to placement of foster youth into permanent homes. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 0081-2024 A Kevin C. Riley Amended and Coupled on GO Requiring an audit and report on foster care placement notices. Introduction The New York State Social Services Law and Family Court Act require that when a foster care placement changes, a social services agency or worker must provide the attorney for the child with notice of the change in placement. This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to conduct annual audits of foster care placement notifications. The audit would include a review of instances in which a notice was not provided as required, the time elapsed between a change in foster care placement and when the placement notice was provided, whether each notice included the information required by law, and a summary of the information that was missing from the notice. ACS would be required to report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and post on the ACS website, a report with the results of its audit from the preceding year. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 1052-2024 A Crystal Hudson Amended and Coupled on GO Expanding foster youth experience surveys to include experiences related to gender expression, gender identity, sex characteristics, and sexual orientation. Introduction This bill would require expansion of the foster youth experience survey that the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is required to distribute annually to foster youth to additionally include questions about the treatment of foster youth by ACS and foster care provider employees, and questions about the experiences of foster youth related to their gender expression, gender identity, sex characteristics, and sexual orientation. The bill would also require ACS to allow foster youth to express any additional feedback about their experiences. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE Not available Int 0420-2024 A Carlina Rivera Amended and Coupled on GO Establishing a program for child visitors to department of correction facilities. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Correction (Department) to establish a child visitor program for the purpose of improving the experience of child visitors of Department facilities, and would require annual reporting on the status of the program. The bill would also require the Department to conduct a study and publish a report on the feasibility of implementing tele-visits on weekend days without reducing the number of hours for in person visits on weekend days. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 0977-2024 A Althea V.  Stevens Amended and Coupled on GO Requiring the department of probation to report on technical probation violations and all programming offered by the department. Introduction This bill would increase the frequency of Department of Probation (DOP) reports on programs offered to probationers, compliance with departmental mandates, and recidivism rates. In addition, the reports will now require information on the specific nature of technical probation violations and clarify that DOP is to provide information on all the programs they administer. Approved by Council Pass Action details Not available Int 1023-2024 A Jennifer Gutiérrez Amended and Coupled on GO Requiring the DOC to establish and operate an online scheduling system for visits to incarcerated persons. Introduction This bill would require the Department of Correction (DOC) to establish and operate an online scheduling system to facilitate visits to incarcerated individuals, provided that DOC shall not require the use of the online scheduling system to visit an incarcerated individual.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget.

These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more?

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

Home API Examples Examples These examples will help you get started with the Legistar Web API.  To use the URLs below, replace {Client} with your client name.  Some clients require use of an API Token . To see all agenda matters, the endpoint is: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters Note that queries replies are limited to 1000 responses.  Even with this limit, some calls may return a large amount of data.  To make this query more performant by limiting reults to a smaller set of items or to obtain more items via a second query, use ODATA parameters to page the output like this: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=0
https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?$top=10&$skip=10 ODATA can also use filters to find more specific data.  For instance, this query will return only events during the month of September, 2014: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/events?$filter=EventDate+ge+datetime%272014-09-01%27+and+EventDate+lt+datetime%272014-10-01%27 The basics of the ODATA URL setup are here: https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ The ODATA documentation does not cover all features, including the convenience method datetime’2014-09-01’ shown above. To see actions taken on a Matter (like a vote), look at the Matter Histories endpoint.  Filtering these items by MatterHistoryActionBodyName can help to limit the found actions to just those votes performed by a certain group, for instance just to votes made by the Common Council on a matter 1234: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters/1234/histories?$filter=MatterHistoryPassedFlag%20ne%20null%20and%20MatterHistoryActionBodyName%20eq%20%27Common%20Council%27 To then see the vote tally, use the returned Id (5678 in this example) with the EventItems Votes endpoint: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/eventitems/5678/votes There are many other items and relationships in the API.  If you have a specific use case, we’d be happy to help you find the appropriate calls. Tips http and https are both supported for GETs – please use as appropriate for your data and consumer. Items returned to GET requests are limited to those items marked as public and available for view on InSite. Limiting queries by paging and filtering will reduce both the load on the server and the time needed to return the requested data. Fields in the API do not reflect any label customization done for your specific site.  If you need help identifying a field’s relationship to your specific Legistar configuration, please ask. For an especially busy site, ordering by item IDs and paging with a filter GT (greater than) the highest returned ID in a set may be more stable.  If you find you are occasionally missing items in long list queries, this is worthwhile to investigate, but slightly more complex. Tokens Some clients require use of API tokens for access.  If the read-only operations above give an unauthorized response, please refer to that client for their token policy. If you have a token, it can be provided as a URL parameter to the https endpoint of this API. For example: https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{Client}/matters?token=verylongbase64token © 2025 - Granicus Version: 25.2.10.0

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.
