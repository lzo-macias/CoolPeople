We are so tired of the trauma, we are so tired of the drama, we are tired of the scandal,” said City Council Speaker and mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams. “As the first woman mayor of the City of New York I’m going to bring no scandal, no drama, no nonsense — just integrity and competence. That’s what the city needs. People are looking for a change, and I’m the change the city needs.” In the latest in the pod’s series of sitdown interviews with the Democratic mayoral candidates, Adams talked about her late entry into the race “when I saw four deputy mayors resign at the same time and it appeared to be because our mayor decided to cozy up to the chaotic Donald Trump — I saw the brains walk out of the computer. And I saw the crumbling of the infrastructure of New York City and I could not sit back and do nothing about it.” Speaker Adams also discussed why she’s “more optimistic than last year this time” negotiating a budget with Mayor Eric Adams (no relation) while running against him, the difference between growing up in Hollis, Queens compared to Andrew Cuomo’s upbringing in affluent Holliswood, Queens, her plan to provide a guaranteed minimum income to more than 21,000 homeless children and young adults , and much more with hosts Christina Greer, Katie Honan and Harry Siegel.

Adams delivered her fourth State of the City address at Jazz at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, outlining her vision for effective leadership of city government. Speaker Adams highlighted major issues facing the city and the Council’s work to tackle them under her leadership. She also unveiled several new proposals that advance increased resources for New Yorkers and solutions to significant challenges across the five boroughs. Over the last three years, Speaker Adams and the Council have prioritized critical issues of health, housing, safety, and opportunity for all New Yorkers. Speaker Adams has introduced several major new initiatives through her past State of the City addresses, and the Council has incubated these innovative programs with its own funding and through partnership. These programs can make an even greater impact with the increased funding support of the mayor’s office. - Advertisement - CUNY Reconnect was first established after Speaker Adams proposed it in her 2022 State of the City Address. A university-wide program that re-engages former working-age students who have earned credits to return and complete their degrees, CUNY Reconnect has helped re-enroll 47,000 students, the majority of whom are women and people of color. Over 3,000 returning students have graduated after accessing this new opportunity. Speaker Adams announced her intention to establish trauma recovery centers, which are designed to provide victim services for survivors of violent crime less likely to receive help and stop cycles of crime. The Council provided the initial funding and support to establish New York State’s first trauma recovery centers in New York City, within the Bronx and Brooklyn. Its multi-year commitment has provided these new services for communities experiencing high levels of violence, contributing to safer neighborhoods. Speaker Adams first announced the intention to initiate city support for anti-poverty guaranteed income programs in her 2023 State of the City Address. The Council then passed Council Member Crystal Hudson’s Local Law 105 of 2023, clearing the pathway for the City to support guaranteed income programs. In October 2024, Speaker Adams and Council Members announced a new Council funding initiative to support a guaranteed income program for expectant mothers to improve maternal health and reduce child poverty. The initiative supported The Bridge Project in establishing a new cohort of 161 pregnant women experiencing housing insecurity who receive regular and unconditional income assistance. It is the first time in city history that municipal funds have been utilized for a guaranteed income program. Speaker Adams also announced several new proposals, including to expand 7-day library service, childcare support for more working families with infants and toddlers, and CUNY programs for working adult and low-income students. Speaker Adams proposed the creation of a minority business accelerator and a new model of holistic community centers, as well as solutions to non-profit contract payment delay solutions. More details on each of these new proposals are outlined below. The full text of the speech can be accessed here . Expanding 7-Day Library Service The Council will seek to expand 7-day library service to 10 additional branches citywide. This approximately $2 million expansion will ensure New Yorkers have more equitable access to library services and the educational and economic opportunities they provide across the five boroughs. Accelerating Minority Business Growth To support the successful growth of minority-owned businesses, the Council will help establish a Minority-Owned Business Accelerator, modeled after a similar effort in Cincinnati. Since 2003, the Cincinnati program has helped several dozen minority-owned small businesses scale up by providing them with strong individualized business strategy and support, greater access to capital to finance expansion, and connections to major regional companies that direct significantly more procurement dollars to them. There are roughly 20,000 Black- and Latino-owned businesses across the five boroughs, but far too few of them ever grow from small businesses into medium-sized or large businesses. Expanding Child Care for Working Families To expand access to affordable childcare for children two years old and younger, the City should fund a voucher that covers half the cost of childcare, or $12,000 per child annually, for families earning up to $128,000 a year—or 100% of the State Median Income. This expansion would provide much-needed relief for working families that are currently ineligible for support and stretched too thin. Increasing Access to a CUNY Higher Education CUNY is an engine of equitable economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers, serving as a pathway to education and mobility. To expand access to educational and economic opportunities for working adults and low-income students in the City’s public university system, the City should take the following steps to expand and enhance CUNY support programs: Baseline funding for CUNY Reconnect Expand Support for Low-Income Adult Learners by establishing CUNY Flex and CUNY Fresh Start programs that provide academic support and forgive old debt Expand CUNY ACE from reaching 3% of eligible students to 30% to boost graduation rates Expand application fee waivers for more low-income students Establishing a New Model for Holistic Community Centers To address disparities in health outcomes and community safety within certain neighborhoods, Speaker Adams proposes the creation of new community health, wellness, and recreation centers in neighborhoods with significant health and safety challenges. The Council will work with City agencies to develop the necessary planning to create these new centers, beginning in Southeast Queens. Fixing Administrative Barriers to CityFHEPS As part of its continued commitment to reduce bureaucratic barriers to accessing CityFHEPS and ensure its effective implementation, the Council is releasing a set of improvements to the program’s application and benefit delivery processes that can be administratively implemented by the mayoral administration and Department of Social Services. These recommendations present viable, low-cost solutions to issues related to administrative delays, technology, personnel, policies and procedures, and source of income discrimination, among others. Reducing Delayed Payments to Non-Profits Despite their essential role, nonprofit service providers face significant challenges due to the City’s routinely late contract payments.  To reduce payment delays to city-contracted non-profit human services organizations and ensure the timely delivery of critical services to New Yorkers, the Council will take the following actions: Advance legislation to reduce delayed payments to non-profits by shifting contracts to a grant-based model Advance legislation that requires City agencies to submit corrective action plans for Retroactive Contract Registrations Advocate for the Administration to restore funding to the Mayor’s Office of Contracts Services (MOCS) Strengthening Community Planning for Housing & Neighborhood Development In December 2022, Speaker Adams released a Planning and Land Use Toolkit , which serves as a principled guide and set of options for Council Members, local communities, land use applicants, and city agencies to employ for successful outcomes that balance citywide goals with neighborhood needs in development. To strengthen more inclusive community involvement and create a more equitable planning process, the Council will release a Community Planning Framework that builds on the Planning and Land Use Toolkit. Expanding the Continuity of Mental Health Care Intensive Mobile Treatment (IMT) and Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) programs provide essential, high-intensity treatment and wraparound support services for individuals with severe mental health challenges. However, demand for these services far exceeds capacity. To address the wait lists for IMT and ACT programs and strengthen the continuum of care, the Council will fund the creation of a pilot step-down program for clients who have progressed in their recovery and require less-intensive services. An accompanying report on the Speaker’s proposals can be found here . A list of the previous State of the City proposals that have been implemented by the Council can be found here . The speech was simultaneously broadcast in Spanish, Mandarin, Bangla, and American Sign Language (ASL). The video of the speech can be found on the Council website via this link . “Our members in the human services sector continue to face economic uncertainty, despite showing up and doing the delicate work of supporting the city’s most vulnerable populations, including our children,” said Henry Garrido, Executive Director of District Council 37 . “We applaud Speaker Adams’ commitment to reducing payment delays to city-contracted non-profits and look forward to working with the City Council to push forward legislative solutions that will ensure our human service workers are paid on time.” “As Speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams has been a staunch advocate for fair housing policies, social justice, and workers’ rights,” said Manny Pastreich, President of 32BJ SEIU . “We applaud her leadership on behalf of working New Yorkers and thank her for always standing up for 32BJ members.” “During her time on the City Council and as Speaker, Adrienne Adams has been a strong voice for the injustices that continually plague women and minorities in both the City of New York and the private sector,” said Gloria Middleton, President of CWA Local 1180 . “She knows that pay inequality and lack of affordable and accessible child care are significant factors to career stagnation. She knows that increasing maternal death rates during childbirth particularly in Black and Brown communities and tensions between law enforcement and minority populations contribute to the escalating tensions of everyday life. She knows the problems that need addressing and she has been tackling them one by one.” You Might Also Like Morgan Family Seeks Justice as Defamation Case Against Queen Ifrica Heads to Court Guyana – Man Dies from Poison After Killing His Ex-Wife, Her Mother and Sister Antigua – US Court Allows Access to PM Browne’s Financial Records in Mega Yacht Sale New York – Jamaican Charged with Shoplifting Detained by ICE Sheryl Lee Ralph – “Dreams Don’t Have an Expiration Date” Sign Up For Daily Newsletter Be keep up!

No. 561-B By Council Members Hudson and Rivera, the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams), and Council Members Williams, Cabán, Hanif, Brooks-Powers, Brewer, Joseph, Avilés, Nurse, Sanchez, Richardson Jordan, Louis, Farías and Won A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to unconditional direct cash assistance pilot programs Be it enacted by the Council as follows: Section 1. Title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 10 to read as follows: CHAPTER 10 UNCONDITIONAL DIRECT CASH ASSISTANCE § 21-931 Legislative findings. a. The council hereby finds that over 40 percent of New Yorkers are affected by poverty or near poverty; that residents of impoverished communities are at increased risk for housing instability and homelessness, mental illness, chronic disease, and lower life expectancy; that in the city of New York, significant differences in poverty rates across race, ethnicity, and gender have persisted for many years as a result of historic and ongoing systemic inequalities; that child poverty affects nearly 1 in 4 children aged 0 to 3 years in the city of New York; that poverty is more likely to affect children, foster youth, young adults, and families of color as well as female-headed households; that single mothers of young children are more likely to drop out of the work force or work low-paid jobs, and to report that they would seek higher paid work if they could access childcare, compared to mothers in two-parent households; that economic disadvantage in a child’s early years has a profound effect on subsequent health, development, and educational attainment; that young adults aging out of foster care in the city of New York face significant barriers to education, employment, and access to housing; that over 4,500 young adults experience homelessness and housing instability in the city of New York each night; that many local and federal policies that were effective in reducing housing instability and child poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic have been discontinued, causing a rebound in homelessness and child poverty; that studies suggest that unconditional direct cash transfer programs offer a cost-effective tool that, in combination with other public benefits programs, can reduce short- and long-term poverty and its negative effects while improving recipients’ well-being across a range of domains; and that additional evidence is needed to determine what characteristics of unconditional direct cash transfer programs are most effective, and to what extent, in reducing poverty and its negative effects while supporting the well-being of children, families, young adults, and other vulnerable individuals. b. The Council recognizes the value of pilot programs that study and evaluate the impact and potential benefits of unconditional direct cash payments on eligible participants’ quality of life; the importance of individualized counseling for eligible participants’ understanding of the potential effects of such payments on other public benefits that they may receive; and the benefits of collecting consistent, meaningful data about participants and the impacts of unconditional direct cash transfer payments in the context of different program designs.  The Council seeks to maximize the utility of such programs and assessments to inform future policymaking. § 21-932 Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings: Benefits counseling. The term “benefits counseling” means individualized counseling offered to potential pilot program participants concerning the foreseeable effects of participation in a pilot program on an individual’s eligibility for any other public benefits or assistance the individual receives or could receive. Eligible participant. The term “eligible participant” means an individual who, at the time of entering a pilot program: 1.

The term “participant” means an individual who receives cash payments through a pilot program. Pilot program.

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, cash payments provided to eligible households pursuant to this chapter shall not be considered income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility for any other public benefits or assistance programs administered by the city. b. For each pilot program that receives city funding pursuant to section 21-933, the commissioner of social services shall petition the New York state commissioner of social services or, as applicable, the New York state commissioner of health to grant any state waivers, seek any waivers from other state agencies, and seek any federal waivers that may be necessary to exclude payments provided to an individual through a pilot program under this chapter for the purposes of eligibility determinations for any public benefits or assistance program where such a waiver may be granted, as appropriate for the eligible participants of a particular pilot program. Where applicable, the commissioner shall consult with relevant agencies and the provider in relation to submitting such petitions. A failure to secure a waiver shall not affect the city’s authority to establish or fund a guaranteed income pilot program subject to the requirements of this chapter. § 21-939 Effect on other laws.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity.  Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.  From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors.  Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center.  Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative.  Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community.  When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

To assist Council Members and residents in understanding what is important to people in their neighborhood, we have initiated a data driven approach, to serve New Yorkers better. We have brought together a variety of data sources ( 311 , Constituent Services , Census ) to understand what New Yorkers care about and how they live in their neighborhoods and city-wide. This strategy goes hand in hand with the important intuitive and nuanced understanding Council Members and residents have about our neighborhoods, to form a fuller picture of what matters most to residents. 311 Calls and Requests NYC 311 provides access to non-emergency City services and information about City government programs. NYC 311 is available online and by phone. The most recent 311 service requests calls this year, showing the most recent 100,000 requests, can show the top call types New Yorkers have placed most recently. Click on the zoom +/- features if map fails to update. See if there is a spike in heat/hot water complaints and where they are occurring. Search to where people have made new street tree requests.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more?

(updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

Sandy is the founder of BK ROT, a co-founder of the Mayday Space, a direct action organizer, and a carpenter.  A third generation Panamanian, she is the daughter of an immigrant and was raised by a working single mother.

Brooks-Powers represents the 31st District which includes the communities of Arverne, Brookville, Edgemere, Laurelton, Springfield Gardens, and Far Rockaway. She was elected in a special election in February 2021.  A fierce advocate for equity in city resources, Selvena Brooks-Powers helped to secure $95 million in restoration to fund the 116th Precinct, expand the Cure Violence program into the 105th Precinct, and establish a permanent COVID-19 vaccine site.  A dedicated public servant for 17 years and lifelong resident of Southeast Queens, Selvena Brooks-Powers is the proud daughter of immigrant parents and devoted to fighting for what’s right and delivering results. As a community organizer, Selvena drove high-impact initiatives on critical issues, including education, voting rights and empowerment, racial and economic justice, relief efforts post-Hurricane Katrina, M/WBE opportunities, and workers’ rights.  Immediately prior to elected office, Selvena was a manager for M/WBE compliance, external affairs and community outreach on the $13 billion JFK International Airport Redevelopment Program.  Previously, Selvena worked for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) family as a communications director for various campaigns, including the Fight for $15 campaign across numerous states, and on one of the tightest Congressional races to win back the majority in the U.S. Congress. Selvena also helped mobilize and ultimately unionized co-workers under the United Media Guild of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), where she was unanimously elected delegate for the northeast region.  Selvena’s prior experiences in government span from the New York State Senate Majority Conference Leader, the New York City Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence, and even as a teen volunteer for the first New York City Public Advocate.  
Selvena has remained committed and consistent to service throughout Queens. She served as an advisor to the NAACP Jamaica Youth Branch, chair to a number of committees within the Queens Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and Board Member to the Ocean Breeze Condominiums and Martin de Porres Youth and Family.  A proud HBCU alumna, Selvena is a graduate of Wilberforce University, the first privately owned and operated HBCU. She also holds a M.S. in International Law from New York University.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Before joining the New York City Council, Tiffany worked as a public defender, representing people who did not have resources to defend themselves against the brutal system of mass incarceration. In her years at New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) and the Legal Aid Society’s Criminal Defense Practice, Tiffany represented over a thousand indigent clients in cases ranging from turnstile jumping to homicide. Throughout her professional career, she has used the law to help New York City’s most vulnerable communities, and her experiences advocating on behalf of her clients helped her identify some of the worst inequities of our criminal justice system. The years she spent as a public defender inspired her to run for elected office, determined to redefine how our city approaches public health and public safety.  Tiffany attended PS 62 in Richmond Hill and JHS 210 Elizabeth Blackwell in Woodhaven, and later attended St. Francis Preparatory High School in Fresh Meadows. Tiffany earned a Bachelor’s degree in Crime, Law, and Justice from Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctorate from New York Law School.

She is the first woman and immigrant to represent this district in the city’s history. As a tenant and activist, Julie has committed to a new vision for her community with a deep focus on creating and preserving affordable housing, increasing access to city resources for all New Yorkers, ensuring that access to quality and affordable internet is guaranteed, and many other issues that are top of mind for her constituents.  At the age of eight, Julie immigrated to New York City with her family looking for a new beginning, an experience she shares with over half of the constituency she represents. Prior to her election, Julie served her neighbors as board member of Queens Community Board 2, Community Capacity Development (CCD), 696 Build Queensbridge, QNS Together, and was a co-founder of the Queens Small Business Alliance (QSBA). In addition, she also worked to make sure that her community was fully counted in the 2020 census as the founder of the Tech Action Group as part of the Queens Borough President’s Complete Count Committee.  
Working at IBM for a decade, Julie was an advisor to the federal government and tasked with reworking various agencies’ use of technology to serve people better. She understands deeply the issues that face large-scale government organizations moving toward the cutting edge, and she has the proven experience to execute those changes. Julie also knows how important it is to provide affordable and quality internet service for all families and how it impacts all aspects of their lives, from education to healthcare access and beyond.  As Council Member, Julie is working towards true equity in the neighborhoods she serves, ensuring that existing communities will have the support and backing to remain sustainable and affordable for generations to come. By expanding culturally appropriate access and engaging the many vibrant and underserved residents of District 26, Julie looks to transform how our government serves all New Yorkers.

Brewer represents the 6th Council District, encompassing most of the Upper West Side up to 108th Street west of Broadway, a part of Clinton (to West 54th St) and all of Central Park.  As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.  For many years, Gale Brewer has taught at CUNY and Barnard College.  Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College. She lives with her husband Cal Snyder, and they have a grown son. In the past, she had many foster children.

As Manhattan Borough President from 2014 – 2021, she passed legislation to reform the deed restriction process, add “caregivers” to the city’s anti-discrimination law, and remove criminal history questions from initial employment applications (the “Fair Chance Act”). She also spearheaded community pre-planning working groups in the South Street Seaport, East Midtown, the Garment Center, Inwood, NoHo/SoHo, and East Harlem neighborhoods.  As Borough President, she submitted over 190 ULURP recommendations; allocated $213 million in capital funds (and more in operational and cultural dollars) to non-profits, schools, and parks; secured a competitive grant of $20 million from the State of New York for revitalization of Chinatown; appointed over 1000 people every year to Community Boards, school boards as well as many other boards and trained them in ethics, land use, budgeting, open data, proposal writing, conflict resolution, and other issues; and opened the first storefront district office for the Borough President on 125th Street in Harlem. She convened task forces on construction safety, African immigrants, small business, faith-based entities and real estate, affordable housing, the closing of Rikers Island jails and other matters.  Before being elected Borough President, she represented the 6th Council District from 2002-2013, when she chaired the Council’s Technology Committee, the Government Operations Committee and the General Welfare Committee. Her legislative highlights include laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, requiring all City data be published online, and protecting domestic workers from abusive practices.  Prior to elected office, she served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Ruth Messinger, NYC Deputy Public Advocate, Director of the city’s Federal Office, and Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women. She worked on a research project regarding non-profits at the CUNY Graduate Center, and she worked for a private firm that focused on creating affordable housing.

Last name: Joseph E-mail: District40@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/rita-joseph/ Notes: District 40 - Council Member - Democrat - Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Park, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens - New York City Councilmember Rita Joseph was elected in 2021 to represent Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Kensington, Ditmas Park, and Southern Crown Heights. Before serving in the City Council, Ms. Joseph was a public school teacher, a community activist, and a proud union member.  After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti in her youth, Ms. Joseph began her life of advocacy. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA’s discriminatory “bad blood” rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule.  Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Ms. Joseph hasn’t looked back with her activism. Despite being a teen mom who was only able to attend college because of a full tuition scholarship, Ms. Joseph spent her twenties raising her children while organizing protests against police brutality and cuts to student transit discounts, even while working a full-time job. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors, both as a teacher at PS6 and as a community activist. Among many other successes, Ms. Joseph was able to provide for her school financially, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars for technological improvements that help thousands of children receive a better education, including funding from then-Borough President Eric Adams, Senator Kevin Parker, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte, and then-Councilmember Matthieu Eugene. Additionally, Ms. Joseph was appointed by State Senator Kevin Parker to serve as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee, thanks to an appointment by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Councilmember Joseph is focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, combatting the climate crisis, and achieving real criminal and social justice reform for New Yorkers.

Since taking office in 2017, Carlina has fought for the affordability and livability of New York City by championing issues around affordable housing, small business survival, equitable healthcare, transportation, and quality of life issues. In addition to tackling these tough legislative issues, she has taken a stand for gender equity as the Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus by sponsoring legislation on sexual harassment and the gender wage gap.  Born and raised in the Lower East Side by a single mother who emigrated from Puerto Rico, Carlina understands the unique challenges District 2 constituents face. Beginning her career as a community organizer supporting seniors and homeless people in the Lower East Side, Carlina is a staunch advocate for safe and affordable housing for all New Yorkers. It was with New York City’s housing crisis in mind that Carlina introduced and passed legislation that provides critical oversight to the short-term rental industry which has impacted the availability of housing.  Carlina is making sure that the small business owners who serve our communities are able to thrive. She has passed legislation that requires the city to provide additional resources to small business owners and to keep track of storefront vacancies. Additionally, she has partnered with community organizations to create a special low interest loan program to help revitalize struggling businesses.  Understanding that safe and effective transportation is crucial to the lives of so many New Yorkers, Carlina has also introduced and passed legislation supporting public transportation, cyclists, and pedestrians, making the city safer for all. Carlina passed Intro 1163, which requires construction sites that block bike lanes provide adequate alternative lanes for cyclists. Protecting bike lanes is one of the many ways Carlina strives to make New York a greener city.  As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals Carlina has fought tirelessly for access to better healthcare for all New Yorkers. She has prioritized reproductive justice by creating the nation’s first Abortion Access Fund, ensuring anyone who comes to New York can receive abortion care regardless of ability to pay. Carlina has also fought to ensure that no New Yorker feels alone in the overwhelming and bureaucratic health care system by introducing legislation that proposes the creation of an Office of the Patient Advocate.  In addition to tackling these major issues that impact all New Yorkers, Carlina has worked to address many of the common complaints New Yorkers face, including the noise that keeps so many of us up at night. In 2019 Carlina introduced legislation that will require the Department of Buildings to cap the amount of After Hours Variance permits it issues to construction projects. Since taking office, Carlina has received calls every day from residents who have been woken up by construction, making it difficult to enjoy their homes.  Carlina was inspired to run for office when the Lower East Side was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and she organized volunteers to provide food, water, and emergency services to communities abandoned by the federal government. She has since secured millions of dollars for her district to improve services, programs, schools, and cultural institutions.  Carlina lives with her husband, pug, and turtle. She graduated from Marist College with a B.A. in Journalism after attending local schools her entire life.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Planning and Land Use Guidelines & Application Toolkit Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Planning for a More Equitable and Affordable NYC Far too often, New York City’s current process of decision-making on land use and development occurs on an ad-hoc basis, lurching from project to project with little grounding in the long-term needs and perspectives of local communities. As a result, policy tools for addressing the housing crisis and advancing inclusive solutions are underutilized. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying policies to address them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. The Land Use and Planning Toolkit explores six major challenges for effective planning, and how the City can turn these challenges into opportunities. These include: Elevating Community Engagement and Addressing Citywide Needs We must expand participation and input from diverse stakeholders at the neighborhood level in the process—in frequency, depth, and inclusivity. Local input should be balanced with long-term citywide goals and needs, elevating the role of planning for communities and the city beyond specific projects and initiatives. Advancing Fair Housing and Increasing Affordability Every district must participate in solving our housing crisis with affordable housing development. Though not every project can be 100% affordable, we should strive to maximize affordability. We must address the racial disparities in access to affordable housing, encourage affordability beyond Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH), and preserve existing affordable housing so residents can remain in their communities. Supporting Equitable Economic Development New developments can create long-term economic opportunities. Applicants should ensure that robust local hiring plans are in place and that jobs come with good benefits and wages. Developers should work with local communities to identify needs, like increased access to fresh groceries, and work to accommodate community-based businesses in new commercial spaces. Improving Open Space and Streets for All New Yorkers Our public spaces are sacred places of gathering and communal living. Low-income New Yorkers and communities of color disproportionately lack access to open and green spaces. We must plan holistically for open spaces and safe streets on a neighborhood-wide level, encouraging greater coordination with the Department of Transportation, the Parks Department, and other agencies. Adapting to Climate Change and Transitioning to Green Energy As we build, we must do so in ways that help reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and private transportation. New York City should incentivize the use of green energy and prioritize public transit access. Ensuring Equitable Access to Healthcare, Education, and Essential Services We must proactively plan to increase access to healthcare and essential services, particularly in neighborhoods that have suffered from historic underinvestment. The health of a community relies on participation of all its members, so we must encourage planning for intergenerational services, like childcare, schools and senior centers. The New York City Council will continue to work with stakeholders across our city to advance equitable and sensible planning that helps address the housing crisis and needs of neighborhoods.

Last name: Williams E-mail: District27@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/nantasha-williams/ Notes: District 27 - Council Member - Democrat - Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, and Springfield Gardens - New York City Council Member Nantasha Williams is the representative for Council District 27 in Southeast Queens and its communities of Cambria Heights, Hollis, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park, and Springfield Gardens.  Nantasha is a community leader, social justice advocate, and political organizer committed to affecting real change in her community. Creating new economic opportunities, youth development, housing, and protecting our seniors are her top priorities. It is her mission to serve the residents of her hometown, Southeast Queens, New York and continue its rich legacy into the future.  Raised by a single mother who worked as a social worker for the city, Nantasha learned at an early age the importance of hard work and the demands and rewards of fighting for our most vulnerable community members. Nationally recognized as a political strategist, she dedicates her life in service to marginalized communities throughout the country. In 2014, she was appointed the Executive Director of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus (“the Caucus”) one of the largest and most influential political entities in the State of New York. As Executive Director, Nantasha fought for millions of citizens to ensure that the policies being drafted by the New York Legislature were inclusive and aimed at improving the well-being and future advancement of people of color in low-income communities across the state.  As an activist, Nantasha confronts issues impacting women and girls, an area she is passionate about. She brings equal determination to fighting for criminal justice reform, stopping gun violence, and ending economic inequality and racial injustice. She served as a member of Community Board 13 where she was appointed Chair of the Special Initiatives Committee, which was created to find ways to modernize all board functions, address unique community issues, and increase board participation. Nantasha serves as board member of Life Camp Inc. – a cure gun violence program supporting efforts that minimize gang crime and gun violence in the community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nantasha took action to ensure the most vulnerable populations in her district had the resources they needed to stay safe and healthy. As a team leader for the SEQ Wellness Ambassador Initiative, Nantasha led a team that called seniors during the first wave of COVID-19 to provide wellness checks in lieu of senior center closures. Nantasha also created an online platform of resources to address the immediate needs of residents in the Southeast Queens area.  To further engage women in politics, Nantasha founded the New York City Black Women’s Political Club, an avenue to build political power for Black women across New York City in 2019. In recognition of her exceptional work and allegiance to her community, Nantasha was honored as one of Albany’s Top 40 under 40 by City & State. But Nantasha’s champion spirit for human rights, women’s rights, and racial equality extends beyond the borders of her home state. She helped lead operations and organizing efforts for one of the largest demonstrations in American history, the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. Nantasha has also organized other demonstrations across the country, leading the charge for protesters demanding representation and implementation of legislative policies for women’s rights and racial justice. Previous to being elected to the City Council, Nantasha served as the Project Manager for Minority Women Business Enterprise Compliance, and helped initiate community outreach efforts for the JFK Redevelopment Program.  Nantasha also volunteered as an advisor to “Until Freedom,” an organization supporting important justice campaigns across the country. This included, most recently, lending her guidance to the proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case.  Nantasha continues her service through advancing her education. She is currently in a PhD Program for Social Welfare at the CUNY Graduate Center with a research focus on Social Movements, Public Policy, and Racial Justice. She acquired her undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Virginia Commonwealth University and holds a Master’s in Public Administration from Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy.

Last name: Hanif E-mail: District39@council.nyc.gov Web site: https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/ Notes: District 39 - Council Member - Democrat - Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Waterfront, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington - Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Shahana Hanif represents the 39th Council District, which includes parts of Kensington, Borough Park, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront.  Born and raised in District 39 to Bangladeshi immigrant parents, Shahana has spent her life fighting for working-class families and a city rooted in care, equity, and justice for all. Her diagnosis at 17 with Lupus, an incurable chronic illness, and her subsequent experiences navigating the costly, nebulous healthcare system and inaccessible city were the catalysts for her organizing and commitment to public service.  Before being elected to the City Council, Shahana served as the Director of Organizing and Community Engagement in former District 39 Council Member Brad Lander’s office where she led grassroots initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, a process that gives New Yorkers a say in how to spend City dollars in their neighborhoods. She has also served as a tenants rights organizer, a gender justice organizer, and an interfaith organizer.  Shahana is the first Muslim woman elected to the New York City Council, and the first woman to represent the 39th District. She will bring our movement’s work for transformational change and a feminist, anti-racist city to City Hall. She is committed to ensuring every constituent is heard. She will work to address block by block sanitation issues, promote education equity across classrooms, expand open streets and funding for parks and playgrounds, implement flooding resilient housing infrastructure, fight big real estate and corporations, and center the needs of women, youth, immigrants, and seniors.  Shahana attended PS 230 in Kensington and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies at Brooklyn College. She lives in Kensington with her cat, Babe.

A graduate of Preston High School and St. John’s University with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics and Master of Arts in Public Administration, where her passion for community service, activism, and empowerment began.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush.

Louis is a first-generation Brooklynite who was raised in an immigrant and pro-union household—an experience that later propelled her into advocacy, community organizing, and ultimately a career in public service.  After nearly six years of service as a staffer, Louis ran in the special election to fill the 45th Council District seat after it was vacated by former Council Member Jumaane D. Williams. She won the election with 42 percent of the votes following six contentious weeks of campaigning.  In 2019, Council Member Louis became the first woman to represent the 45th District which comprises Flatbush, East Flatbush, Midwood, Marine Park, Flatlands, and Kensington in Brooklyn, NY.  During her first year in office, Council Member Louis rolled out an ambitious agenda and spearheaded critical legislation to protect survivors of domestic violence; close the food insecurity gap; expand access to nonprofit services, education, reproductive rights, and healthcare.   Despite the setback of entering in the middle of a legislative session, Council Member Louis sought to secure a leadership role in the City Council.  With an overwhelming vote, she became Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus and Vice Co-Chair of the Black, Latino/a, and Asian Caucus. She is also a member of the committees on Civil Service and Labor; Economic Development; Education; Finance; Housing and Buildings; Youth Services; Women and Gender Equity. In January 2021, she was appointed as Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions.   Prior to joining the City Council, Louis worked as an administrator in healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital and was an active 1199 member for eight years. Louis was also a seasoned publicist with fifteen years of experience and a journalist with several media outlets. In 2012, she founded Girls Leading Up (GLU), an organization seeking to transform girls and young women into emerging leaders through mentoring and hands-on experience. Her dedication to youth and women’s empowerment stems from life-changing experiences that she has used to enact positive change.  As a staunch believer in civic engagement, Louis has worked closely with elected officials, city agencies, nonprofit organizations, and small businesses to bridge the opportunity gap through education. Her parents emigrated from Haiti to Brooklyn where they overcame language barriers, discrimination, and other challenges while rebuilding their lives in Brooklyn as a middle-class family. Louis’ mother was a long-time healthcare professional and 1199 member while her father worked as a law enforcement professional and later a yellow cab driver. Their experience, determination, and service to the community would serve as a foundation for Louis’ work in social justice, immigrants’ and workers’ rights, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.  Council Member Louis is a proud graduate of the New York City public school system as an alumna of Midwood High School, located in the heart of Flatbush. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration with a concentration in Strategic Communications from New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Long Island University.

She is the daughter of Dr. Lynne Richardson and Dr. Desmond Jordan, two minority physicians who trained at the historic Harlem Hospital.  Her father, Dr. Desmond A. Jordan, just passed this past November 2020. He is deeply missed.  Growing up Kristin (KRJ) was in and out of Lenox Terrace where her great aunt was an original tenant and where Kristin herself lives now. She attended the Calhoun School where she graduated cum laude with distinction in Social Studies, Spanish, Mathematics, Science, and Music. She then attended Brown University where she graduated class of 2009 as a double major in in Black Studies (“Africana”) and Literary Arts and was a commencement speaker for the Africana Studies department.  Kristin (KRJ) is a book printing poet, teaching artist, author, and activist in the Harlem community, where her mother is also from and lives, where her great aunt (as mentioned above) was from and lived, and where her grandparents (married at Abyssinia Baptist Church) lived – 3 generations of Harlem.  Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has published her own (and others) work by starting an independent publishing company called Pens Up Press, for literary activists generally, and Black and Latino activists in particular to publish and promote books for and about making a better world. Kristin’s first book titled Mules Fight Back: 40 Activist Poems and Stories is a poetic response to the famous Zora Neale Hurston reference that the Black woman is the “mule of the world,” and her most recent work, Water & Light: Choose Love Now, rooted in her personal experience with an abusive relationship is about a totality of things from personal, interpersonal, romantic, platonic, social, communal to national revolution. In addition to her own work and publishing, Kristin also coordinates the Uproar Poetry Group, an online Facebook platform for activist poets, and (until recently with the COVID pandemic) ran senior poems and senior current events workshops at A. Phillip Randolph Senior Center and Central Harlem Senior Center. She and her team continue to serve seniors and ALL Harlem residents with daily wellness checks and mutual aid.  As an activist Kristin has participated in the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street mass movements. She’s been a member of the ANSWER coalition (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), a supporter of Freedom Hall and Sister’s Uptown Bookstore in Harlem, and a member of AALUSC (African Ancestrial Lesbians United for Societal Change). In 2012 Kristin founded a cop watch team and has continued to this day to be an advocate for police accountability. She is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, a member of LT-ACT (Lenox Terrace Tenants Association), and the Social Justice Chair for United Methodist Women at Salem Church. Kristin is also a practicing Buddhist (Christian Buddhist) and member of Soka Gakkai International (SGI). Some opponents with ties to the establishment claim they have “never seen Kristin” because of her lack of ties to Harlem’s political machine, but anyone active in Harlem community service and anyone out in the streets with the protests last summer and for years before knows Kristin, KRJ, Kristin for Harlem.  As a teacher and a teaching artist KRJ has worked for a number of notable organizations including Directions For Our Youth and Girl Be Heard; and until recently was a literacy specialist at Harlem Boys & Girls Club. She was also the co-founder of Freedom Love Birthright a writing and community theatre youth program in the spirit of African and African-American ancestry that took place in 2019 in Central Harlem.  As a public speaker, panelist, and guest lecturer, Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) has presented at Circle of Voices, the Kennedy Center, Hostos Community College, and Montclair State University. She has also been featured on a number of podcasts including Mind Over Melanin.  Kristin is passionate about social justice, and the history, politics, and culture(s) of all people generally and Black people in particular. Politically spiritually and personally she believes in serving people including but not limited to housing, environment, health, food, education, and criminal/policing justice. She is an optimist and an idealist who dreams about a truly equal and equitable world based on seeing whole people and the humanity in every person.

Read on to learn more about the legislation passed at today’s session. 🧵 

The “Protect Trans Futures” package (sponsored by @CabanD22, @CMShahanaHanif, @CMChiOsse, @CMCrystalHudson) aims to improve resources and ensure protections for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers. 

INT 26-A (sponsored by @CMAmandaFarias) prohibits helicopters that do not meet the most stringent FAA noise standards from operating for non-essential purposes out of the East 34th Street Heliport and Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, beginning at the end of 2029. 

INT 1150-A (sponsored by @JimGennaro) requires @NYCWater to develop a plan to increase the capacity of the stormwater system to reduce flooding. 

Stemming from @NYCSpeakerAdams‘ 2024 State of the City, INT 889-A and INT 1086-A (sponsored by @CMCrystalHudson and @CMNantashaW) combat deed theft by requiring @NYCFinance to notify the local Council Member when a recorded deed- or mortgage-related document affects an interest in real property that has been held by the same party for 30 years, and notifying interested parties when such a document has been recorded for the property. 

INT 860-A and INT 861-A (sponsored by @CMAlexaAviles) requires local development corporations to report on community hiring programs and requires the contract between the City and @NYCEDC to detail agreements between developers and non-profits or individuals to provide community benefits as part of a development project.

She was elected in 2021 and made history as one of the first out gay Black women ever elected in New York City. Crystal is a community organizer and public servant committed to making government more accessible for more people and delivering a just recovery for all New Yorkers in the wake of a global pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning.  Her commitment to public service is personal and began when her mother started exhibiting signs of what would later be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. As the only child of a single mother, Crystal quickly became the primary caregiver for her mother. She experienced first-hand how difficult it is for working families to navigate complex, bureaucratic systems and access services and resources needed to keep older New Yorkers safe and healthy at home, where they can age in place and maintain their dignity. Crystal is a fierce advocate for seniors and families impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and is unwavering in her commitment to serving families who are caring for loved ones.  Before entering public service, Crystal spent more than a decade working in marketing and advertising –– first with the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and NBA’s Washington Wizards and then at Amtrak, where she managed a portfolio of sports, entertainment and multicultural marketing campaigns for the nation’s passenger rail service. In this capacity, Crystal led an effort to further diversify Amtrak’s advertising and fought for the inclusion of marginalized communities in national advertising campaigns. Once she entered public service, Crystal served as Co-Director of the Community Outreach Unit at the New York City Council, First Deputy Public Advocate of Community Engagement at the Office of the Public Advocate, and Chief of Operations to the Majority Leader of the City Council.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Crystal founded Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) and rooted the group’s work in core principles of mutual aid learned from people of African descent and those who are indigenous and native to the United States. GPHMA works to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing food insecurity and economic instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic –– especially seniors and those with underlying health conditions.  Crystal was named as one of Out magazine’s OUT100 honorees in 2021, and has also been recognized by City & State New York magazine on its ‘Brooklyn Power 100’ and ‘Power of Diversity: Black 100’ lists.  Crystal is the daughter and granddaughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, and a third-generation Brooklynite. She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and holds a Master’s degree from George Washington University. She lives with her partner, Sasha Ahuja, in Prospect Heights.

King Posted on March 6, 2025 City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. Photo courtesy Office of the Speaker of the Council of the City of New York New York City Council Speaker Adrienne E. Adams delivered her fourth State of the City address at Jazz at Lincoln Center in Manhattan on Tuesday, outlining her vision for what she describes as “effective leadership of city government.” Speaker Adams highlighted significant issues facing the city and the Council’s work to tackle them under her leadership. She also unveiled several new proposals that advance increased resources for New Yorkers and solutions to significant challenges across the five boroughs. Over the last three years, Speaker Adams said she and the Council have prioritized critical issues of health, housing, safety, and opportunity for all New Yorkers. Speaker Adams said she has introduced several significant new initiatives through her past State of the City addresses, and the Council has incubated these innovative programs with its funding and through partnership.

Email Sign Up “These programs can make an even greater impact with the increased funding support of the mayor’s office,” she said. Speaker Adams announced her intention to establish trauma recovery centers, which are designed to provide victim services for survivors of violent crime less likely to receive help and stop cycles of crime. She said the Council provided the initial funding and support to establish New York State’s first trauma recovery centers in New York City, within the Bronx and Brooklyn. Its multi-year commitment has provided these new services for communities experiencing high levels of violence, contributing to safer neighborhoods. Speaker Adams first announced the intention to initiate city support for anti-poverty guaranteed income programs in her 2023 State of the City Address. The Council then passed Council Member Crystal Hudson’s Local Law 105 of 2023, clearing the pathway for the City to support guaranteed income programs. In October 2024, Speaker Adams and Council Members announced a new Council funding initiative to support a guaranteed income program for expectant mothers to improve maternal health and reduce child poverty. The initiative supported The Bridge Project in establishing a new cohort of 161 pregnant women experiencing housing insecurity who receive regular and unconditional income assistance. “It is the first time in city history that municipal funds have been utilized for a guaranteed income program,” Speaker Adams said. She also announced several new proposals, including expanding the seven-day library service, providing childcare support for more working families with infants and toddlers, and expanding CUNY programs for working adults and low-income students. Speaker Adams proposed the creation of a minority business accelerator, a new model of holistic community centers, and solutions to non-profit contract payment delay solutions. “Our members in the human services sector continue to face economic uncertainty despite showing up and doing the delicate work of supporting the city’s most vulnerable populations, including our children,” said Henry Garrido, executive director of District Council 37. “We applaud Speaker Adams’ commitment to reducing payment delays to city-contracted non-profits and look forward to working with the City Council to push forward legislative solutions that will ensure our human service workers are paid on time.” “As Speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams has been a staunch advocate for fair housing policies, social justice, and workers’ rights,” said Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ SEIU. “We applaud her leadership on behalf of working New Yorkers and thank her for always standing up for 32BJ members.” “During her time on the City Council and as Speaker, Adrienne Adams has been a strong voice for the injustices that continually plague women and minorities in both the City of New York and the private sector,” said Gloria Middleton, president of CWA Local 1180. “She knows that pay inequality and lack of affordable and accessible child care are significant factors to career stagnation,” she added. “She knows that increasing maternal death rates during childbirth, particularly in Black and Brown communities, and tensions between law enforcement and minority populations contribute to the escalating tensions of everyday life. She knows the problems that need addressing and has been tackling them one by one.” “Speaker Adams’ State of the City address today highlighted her critical leadership and dedication to lifting New York’s working families,” said Rich Maroko, the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council (HTC) president. “From taking aim at the city’s housing crisis to delivering critical safety protections for hotel workers, Speaker Adams has pursued an agenda that promotes working New Yorkers. “Our union was proud to participate in this State of the City event to celebrate the victories and vision of the City Council under Speaker Adrienne Adams’ direction,” he added.

At the beginning one protestor was questioning why there was only eight candidates and not nine participating in the event and called for the ninth person to be included. The protestor was later removed by security. Later another protestor crashed the stage just as Scott Stringer took his seat on stage. The protestor who wore a mask said  “I am the youngest on the ballot but they don’t want me here. The only one who supports reparation. I am the only one who is not backed by millionaires and billionaires.” He was also removed by security.

Memories of the people’s pope By Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello Posted on April 24, 2025 Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello shares a joyful moment with Pope Francis during one of his many visits to Rome on behalf of charitable foundations close to the pontiff’s heart. Photo courtesy of Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello When I think of Pope Francis, the first thoughts that come to mind are: a holy man, a humble man, and a human being. A holy man: To be holy in the eyes of God is to be like God, who loves all the human beings He created. Humble because Pope Francis believed we are all equal in the eyes of God, and that he was no more entitled or better than anyone else simply because he was the leader of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. A human being because he respected all of God’s people, regardless of race, nationality, religion or status. He believed all humans should treat one another as God’s children, just as he did throughout his life. Here are my encounters with Pope Francis. When he was first elected, like most Catholics and people around the world, he was unknown to me. But his decision to take the name Francis — after St. Francis of Assisi, known for humility, poverty and love of all God’s creation — revealed to us what type of papacy we would encounter. Stories of him riding public transportation, returning to the Rome hotel where he stayed before the conclave to pay his bill, and choosing not to live in the papal palace told us everything.

Email Sign Up I remember speaking about this on “Good Day New York” with Rosanna Scotto, and we knew from that moment he would be the people’s pope. My next encounter was in September 2015, when Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of Brooklyn asked me to help organize the arrival of Pope Francis at Kennedy Airport as he came to address the United Nations. I was informed there would be no formal ceremony or meeting with people at the airport to transfer from his plane to the helicopter en route to Manhattan. But I knew, deep down, that if he saw anyone frail or with a disability, he would spontaneously depart from his scheduled routine to greet them and impart his blessings on them, which he indeed did. We invited young people, elderly residents from nursing homes, seniors from local centers, and children with special needs. We gave them a special moment to be with the Holy Father that they still talk about today. Msgr. Gigantiello meets with Pope Francis. Photo courtesy of Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello After his helicopter departed for St. Patrick’s Cathedral, I rushed to the cathedral to be part of the prayer service with New Yorkers and the faithful from the Tri-State area, as well as my friends and dedicated parishioners. The next day was an ecumenical prayer service at Ground Zero, which was a very moving experience for everyone — but personally significant for me, having experienced 9/11 on that tragic day and ministering at the site for days and months afterward. The highlight was a Mass at Madison Square Garden, and I recall how emotional and special it was for so many people, young and old alike! In New York, he did what he was known for: bringing people together and reaching out to those on the periphery of society. Between 2015 and 2024, my encounters were limited to papal audiences, Sunday blessings in Saint Peter’s Square, and the pilgrims I led to Rome. In 2024, I was asked to share my skills in development — a vital part of the church’s life in Brooklyn — with the universal church based in Rome. With the Holy Father’s blessing, I began assisting in developing resources in the U.S. to benefit two foundations dear to him: the Be Human Foundation and the St. Peter for Humanity Foundation. Both of these foundations aim to improve lives and unite people around the world to promote the common good. Children were very special to Pope Francis — particularly sick children. The Be Human Foundation supports the Patrons of the World’s Children’s Hospital, which offers care to children worldwide, especially in poor nations, ensuring they receive up-to-date medical treatment. Over the past year, my work with these foundations brought me to Rome seven times. During these travels, I had several encounters with Pope Francis. I met global leaders like Mrs. Nelson Mandela, Vice President Al Gore, Nobel Peace Prize winners, clergy of many faiths, and everyday people — like the generous-hearted Mr. Frank Bisignano and public servants like Mayor Eric Adams. One highlight was gathering children from across Europe for the World’s Children’s Day in Rome. More than 100,000 young people gathered at a stadium and at a Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica, where the pope spoke to, encouraged and blessed them. At this gathering, I had the special privilege of meeting the mother of soon-to-be St. Carlos Acudos, the first millennial saint. One of my fondest memories is from a reception in Rome where Italian pastries were being served. I saw the Holy Father enjoying one and said to him, “Mi piace” (“I like it”). He smiled. I then added, “Ti piace” (“You like it”), and he answered, “Sì.” We both shared a smile in that simple, joyful moment. I often reflect on that pleasant and personal encounter with the Holy Father. My last encounter with Pope Francis came just 11 days before he entered the hospital. At that intimate gathering, I told him I would do my best to raise the resources he needed to continue his legacy. He gave me his blessing and thanked me for my labor on behalf of his mission. Who would have thought that would be my final moment with him? That encounter inspired me to continue working with fervor, conviction and love to serve God’s people and His church — and to keep the legacy of Pope Francis alive. “Fratelli Tutti” — All brothers and sisters.

Between 2015 and 2024, my encounters were limited to papal audiences, Sunday blessings in Saint Peter’s Square, and the pilgrims I led to Rome. In 2024, I was asked to share my skills in development — a vital part of the church’s life in Brooklyn — with the universal church based in Rome. With the Holy Father’s blessing, I began assisting in developing resources in the U.S. to benefit two foundations dear to him: the Be Human Foundation and the St. Peter for Humanity Foundation. Both of these foundations aim to improve lives and unite people around the world to promote the common good. Children were very special to Pope Francis — particularly sick children. The Be Human Foundation supports the Patrons of the World’s Children’s Hospital, which offers care to children worldwide, especially in poor nations, ensuring they receive up-to-date medical treatment. Over the past year, my work with these foundations brought me to Rome seven times. During these travels, I had several encounters with Pope Francis. I met global leaders like Mrs. Nelson Mandela, Vice President Al Gore, Nobel Peace Prize winners, clergy of many faiths, and everyday people — like the generous-hearted Mr. Frank Bisignano and public servants like Mayor Eric Adams. One highlight was gathering children from across Europe for the World’s Children’s Day in Rome. More than 100,000 young people gathered at a stadium and at a Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica, where the pope spoke to, encouraged and blessed them. At this gathering, I had the special privilege of meeting the mother of soon-to-be St. Carlos Acudos, the first millennial saint. One of my fondest memories is from a reception in Rome where Italian pastries were being served. I saw the Holy Father enjoying one and said to him, “Mi piace” (“I like it”). He smiled. I then added, “Ti piace” (“You like it”), and he answered, “Sì.” We both shared a smile in that simple, joyful moment. I often reflect on that pleasant and personal encounter with the Holy Father. My last encounter with Pope Francis came just 11 days before he entered the hospital. At that intimate gathering, I told him I would do my best to raise the resources he needed to continue his legacy. He gave me his blessing and thanked me for my labor on behalf of his mission. Who would have thought that would be my final moment with him? That encounter inspired me to continue working with fervor, conviction and love to serve God’s people and His church — and to keep the legacy of Pope Francis alive. “Fratelli Tutti” — All brothers and sisters. Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello is pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel/Annunciation Church in Brooklyn, and the author and host of “Breaking Bread” When he was first elected, like most Catholics and people around the world, he was unknown to me. But his decision to take the name Francis — after St. Francis of Assisi, known for humility, poverty and love of all God’s creation — revealed to us what type of papacy we would encounter. Stories of him riding public transportation, returning to the Rome hotel where he stayed before the conclave to pay his bill, and choosing not to live in the papal palace told us everything. Close Get the Full Story Sign Up I remember speaking about this on “Good Day New York” with Rosanna Scotto, and we knew from that moment he would be the people’s pope. My next encounter was in September 2015, when Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of Brooklyn asked me to help organize the arrival of Pope Francis at Kennedy Airport as he came to address the United Nations. I was informed there would be no formal ceremony or meeting with people at the airport to transfer from his plane to the helicopter en route to Manhattan. But I knew, deep down, that if he saw anyone frail or with a disability, he would spontaneously depart from his scheduled routine to greet them and impart his blessings on them, which he indeed did. We invited young people, elderly residents from nursing homes, seniors from local centers, and children with special needs. We gave them a special moment to be with the Holy Father that they still talk about today. Msgr. Gigantiello meets with Pope Francis. Photo courtesy of Msgr. Jamie J. Gigantiello After his helicopter departed for St. Patrick’s Cathedral, I rushed to the cathedral to be part of the prayer service with New Yorkers and the faithful from the Tri-State area, as well as my friends and dedicated parishioners. The next day was an ecumenical prayer service at Ground Zero, which was a very moving experience for everyone — but personally significant for me, having experienced 9/11 on that tragic day and ministering at the site for days and months afterward.

King Posted on April 23, 2025 Governor Kathy Hochul unveils Liberty Landing, a transformative project to convert the state-owned 100,000 square-foot former Bayview Correctional Facility in Manhattan into affordable housing for low-income residents and supportive housing for formerly incarcerated individuals reentering the community. The proposed project, a joint venture between Camber Property Group and Osborne Association, would invest over $108 million in West Chelsea and provide 124 permanently affordable housing units and on-site supportive services. Photo by Susan Watts/Office of Governor Kathy Hochul Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday, April 21, directed flags to be lowered at half-staff to honor the life and legacy of His Holiness Pope Francis, who passed away on Monday at 88. “I join everyone around the world in mourning the loss of His Holiness Pope Francis, as his leadership transcended religious boundaries,” Hochul said. “He embodied the values Christ taught us every day: helping the less fortunate, calling for peace, and ensuring every person is treated as a child of God. “Pope Francis led with compassion, humility and inclusivity, emphasizing that God does not disown any of his children, and reminded us of our collective responsibility to protect this beautiful planet, our shared home,” she added. “We should all strive to carry on his legacy.” Pope Francis lies in state in St. Peter’s Basilica, at the Vatican, April 23, 2025. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Last year, Gov. Hochul visited the Vatican to deliver remarks at a Pontifical Summit to discuss climate change, where Pope Francis delivered an address calling on the world to take care of the most vulnerable in our society.

King Posted on April 3, 2025 Michael Blake to run for mayor. Photo by James McCray, Hy-Sync Media On Wednesday, Jamaican-American New York City Mayoral Candidate, the Rev. Michael Blake, condemned a federal judge’s dismissal of corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. On Wednesday, Manhattan Federal Judge Dale Ho dismissed “with prejudice” the sweeping public corruption charges against Adams, ruling that “There may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ (President Donal J. Trump’s Department of Justice), if taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the mayor.” But Rev. Blake, the son of Jamaican immigrants, told Caribbean Life , “The dropping of the charges against Eric Adams doesn’t change the obvious: Eric Adams likely broke the law with an illegal campaign donation pay-to-play scheme. Close Stay Connected to the Caribbean Get the latest news and updates delivered to your inbox. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up “He is just being saved by a Trump Justice Department that expects him to be their lackey,” said Blake, one of prospective nine candidates vying to oppose the mayor in the June Democratic Primary. “Judge Ho bowing to King Trump by dropping charges is the latest attack on our belief in government,” he added. “We need judges who will demand accountability—not turn a blind eye to blatant corruption. “The timing is not a surprise, given that it’s the day before MAGA Eric needs to decide if he is still running as a Democrat,” Rev. Blake continued. “Once again, Trump and Elon (Musk) are trying to save Eric. “Trump continues creating legal chaos and fear — not hope or order,” he said. “Today is the latest reminder that we desperately need a new generation of Black leadership.” New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who has no relations with the mayor, said Judge Ho’s decision “does not absolve Mayor Adams of his actions. “It also does not end the chaos and shame this has brought on our city with other ongoing criminal cases and investigations of the mayor’s office,” said Speaker Adams, who is expected to be among the mayor’s challengers in the June Primary. “As Judge Ho stated in his ruling, ‘Everything here smacks of a bargain: Dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.’ “Our city’s mayor should never be in the position of bargaining away New Yorkers and their rights, “ she said. “The extraordinary decision was only caused by the quid pro quo attempted between the Trump administration and Eric Adams. “ It sends a terrible message and is a glaring example of double standards in our justice system, where the powerful evade accountability that is often faced by the average person, “ Speaker Adams added. “This undermines equal justice under the law that should be a pillar of our justice system. “New Yorkers deserve strong, independent, and focused leadership that won’t bend or cower to Trump and Elon Musk, “ she continued. “Protecting our city and working families from their attacks must be our top priority, without the distractions and instability that have compromised this administration.” On Wednesday, Judge Ho dismissed the charges against Adams “with prejudice,” meaning they cannot be refiled in the future. In early February, Trump’s DOJ instructed the Southern District Court of New York to drop the case against the mayor, saying it affected his ability to cooperate with Trump’s sweeping deportation policies and seek reelection . But, in his ruling on Wednesday, Judge Ho said that “the record does not show that this case has impaired Mayor Adams in his immigration enforcement efforts.” Last month, Caribbean immigration advocates strongly condemned Adams’s appearance before the US Congressional Committee on Oversight amid heightened calls for his resignation over reported collusion with Trump over mass deportations. Adams and three other mayors of “sanctuary cities “ —Chicago, Boston, and Denver—testified before the Committee. “In today’s Congressional hearing on sanctuary cities, we saw further evidence that Eric Adams is unfit to lead New York City, “ Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), an umbrella organization that represents over 200 immigrant advocacy groups in New York, told Caribbean Life at the time. “Even in this sham hearing – which was mostly an opportunity for extremist MAGA Republicans to spew hate and distortions about immigration – the mayor’s ability to lead the city was repeatedly questioned, “ he added. “ We did not expect to learn much from this spectacle, but as Congress members questioned Eric Adams, we rarely got past the debate of if he entered a quid pro quo agreement with the Trump administration. “Instead of going to bat for all New Yorkers, Adams once again stood up for himself and himself alone, “ Awawdeh continued. “ We commend the Mayors of Boston, Chicago, and Denver for standing up for their city’s residents and for promoting sanctuary policies that ensure public safety for all. “ Natalia Aristizabal of Make the Road Action, another immigrant advocacy group in New York, said: “Time and again, Mayor Adams has shown that he is more interested in cozying up to the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda than protecting everyone in New York City. “Instead of showing leadership and standing up for our immigrant communities, the mayor is selling out immigrant families in an effort to salvage his own political career, “ she said. As calls intensified for the mayor to step down, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed new actions to restore public trust in the New York City government. Hochul announced sweeping expansion of state oversight and new guardrails to ensure what she described as “accountability “ and the protection of New Yorkers. However, the governor noted that these actions would require legislative action and that they would take effect immediately upon passage. “To move this city forward, I am undertaking the implementation of certain guardrails that I believe are a first start toward re-establishing trust for New York City residents, “ Hochul said. “These proposed guardrails will help ensure that all decisions out of City Hall are in the clear interests of the people of New York City and not at the behest of the president.” She announced the establishment of a new Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs and Protection of City Commissioner of Investigation. The governor said the new Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs will be established within the New York State Inspector General Office. She said the Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs will receive updates and information directly from the New York City Department of Investigations (NYCDOI) about corruption investigations. She will also be able to direct NYCDOI to commence investigations across city government. Hochul said the New York City Charter will be revised to ensure her continued independence. The Mayor cannot terminate the New York City Commissioner of Investigation without approval by the State Inspector General. Under the governor’s plan, the City Comptroller, Council, and Public Advocate will be given “explicit authority “ to bring litigation against the federal government, using outside counsel if the city’s law department declines to do so promptly after a request. Hochul said such litigation could be filed against any federal government agency or entity. “This action will ensure that New Yorkers have multiple avenues to initiate legal action in cases where the rights or freedoms of New York City residents are under attack by the federal government, “ she said. Given the unprecedented breadth and number of executive orders, other policy documents, and notices issued by the Trump administration, the governor proposed additional funds for the Office of the State Comptroller of the City to support the state’s existing ability to continue to monitor the city and its finances “in this complex environment. “ She said the state will expand the Office of the Deputy State Comptroller for City Oversight and that the new funding will be paid using New York City tax receipts. “These new resources will enable state officials to more closely monitor New York City’s fiscal operations and to take any actions needed based on such review, “ Hochul said. In response, Adams said in a brief statement that he “was elected by the people of New York City and its working-class communities to uphold their values — and that is what our administration has done. “While there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers’ power by limiting the authority of my office, I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong, “ he said. “I look forward to continuing those conversations.” However, Awawdeh said that “New York City, under Mayor Eric Adams, is beholden to Donald Trump’s demands. “No new checks that New York State could impose on New York City will fix that issue, “ he told Caribbean Life. “ Eric Adams sold out New Yorkers to avoid prosecution for corruption charges in a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration, plain and simple. “Now, he is working with the Trump administration to separate families in New York City in direct violation of our local sanctuary policies, “ Awawdeh added. “All New Yorkers will face real and dire consequences from Gov.  Hochul’s refusal to hold the mayor accountable for his actions. “The people will not remain silent in the face of the threat posed by Eric Adams to immigrant New Yorkers, “ he continued. Amid Adams’s collusion with Trump, Caribbean and other immigrant advocates in New York have urged the city workforce not to collude with ICE agents. “At a time when New Yorkers cannot rely on their mayor to follow the law, others in the Adams administration must step up, “ Awawdeh urged. “Mayor Adams may view his own participation in Trump’s mass deportation agenda as a get out of jail free card, but the actions he will be directing his subordinates to take to collude with ICE are both legally dubious and morally corrupt. “We are calling on all remaining deputy mayors, city agency commissioners, and city workers within the Adams administration to not comply with any orders to collaborate with ICE from this mayor, who remains compromised in his ability to put the needs and the safety of New Yorkers ahead of his own, “ he added. Mayor Adams said in a Wednesday video message to New Yorkers : “Let me be clear. As I’ve said all along, this case should have never been brought. And I did nothing wrong. “I’m now happy that our city can finally close the book on this and focus solely on the future of our great city, “ he said. “ I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, prayed for me, supported me from day one, and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand . “I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place, “ the mayor added. “The lies spread through false leaks and splashed across sensational headlines and all of the distractions. “ But what I want you to know is that I never stop working for you, not for one day, not for one hour, not for one minute, because you are who I think about every morning. You are my north star, “ he continued. About the Author Mayoral candidate condemns dismissal of corruption charges against Adams By Nelson A. King By Nelson A.

However, the governor noted that these actions would require legislative action and that they would take effect immediately upon passage. “To move this city forward, I am undertaking the implementation of certain guardrails that I believe are a first start toward re-establishing trust for New York City residents, “ Hochul said. “These proposed guardrails will help ensure that all decisions out of City Hall are in the clear interests of the people of New York City and not at the behest of the president.” She announced the establishment of a new Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs and Protection of City Commissioner of Investigation. The governor said the new Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs will be established within the New York State Inspector General Office. She said the Special Inspector General for New York City Affairs will receive updates and information directly from the New York City Department of Investigations (NYCDOI) about corruption investigations. She will also be able to direct NYCDOI to commence investigations across city government. Hochul said the New York City Charter will be revised to ensure her continued independence. The Mayor cannot terminate the New York City Commissioner of Investigation without approval by the State Inspector General. Under the governor’s plan, the City Comptroller, Council, and Public Advocate will be given “explicit authority “ to bring litigation against the federal government, using outside counsel if the city’s law department declines to do so promptly after a request. Hochul said such litigation could be filed against any federal government agency or entity. “This action will ensure that New Yorkers have multiple avenues to initiate legal action in cases where the rights or freedoms of New York City residents are under attack by the federal government, “ she said. Given the unprecedented breadth and number of executive orders, other policy documents, and notices issued by the Trump administration, the governor proposed additional funds for the Office of the State Comptroller of the City to support the state’s existing ability to continue to monitor the city and its finances “in this complex environment. “ She said the state will expand the Office of the Deputy State Comptroller for City Oversight and that the new funding will be paid using New York City tax receipts. “These new resources will enable state officials to more closely monitor New York City’s fiscal operations and to take any actions needed based on such review, “ Hochul said. In response, Adams said in a brief statement that he “was elected by the people of New York City and its working-class communities to uphold their values — and that is what our administration has done. “While there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers’ power by limiting the authority of my office, I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong, “ he said. “I look forward to continuing those conversations.” However, Awawdeh said that “New York City, under Mayor Eric Adams, is beholden to Donald Trump’s demands. “No new checks that New York State could impose on New York City will fix that issue, “ he told Caribbean Life. “ Eric Adams sold out New Yorkers to avoid prosecution for corruption charges in a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration, plain and simple. “Now, he is working with the Trump administration to separate families in New York City in direct violation of our local sanctuary policies, “ Awawdeh added. “All New Yorkers will face real and dire consequences from Gov.  Hochul’s refusal to hold the mayor accountable for his actions. “The people will not remain silent in the face of the threat posed by Eric Adams to immigrant New Yorkers, “ he continued. Amid Adams’s collusion with Trump, Caribbean and other immigrant advocates in New York have urged the city workforce not to collude with ICE agents. “At a time when New Yorkers cannot rely on their mayor to follow the law, others in the Adams administration must step up, “ Awawdeh urged. “Mayor Adams may view his own participation in Trump’s mass deportation agenda as a get out of jail free card, but the actions he will be directing his subordinates to take to collude with ICE are both legally dubious and morally corrupt. “We are calling on all remaining deputy mayors, city agency commissioners, and city workers within the Adams administration to not comply with any orders to collaborate with ICE from this mayor, who remains compromised in his ability to put the needs and the safety of New Yorkers ahead of his own, “ he added. Mayor Adams said in a Wednesday video message to New Yorkers : “Let me be clear. As I’ve said all along, this case should have never been brought. And I did nothing wrong. “I’m now happy that our city can finally close the book on this and focus solely on the future of our great city, “ he said. “ I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, prayed for me, supported me from day one, and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand . “I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place, “ the mayor added. “The lies spread through false leaks and splashed across sensational headlines and all of the distractions. “ But what I want you to know is that I never stop working for you, not for one day, not for one hour, not for one minute, because you are who I think about every morning. You are my north star, “ he continued. On Wednesday, Judge Ho dismissed the charges against Adams “with prejudice,” meaning they cannot be refiled in the future. In early February, Trump’s DOJ instructed the Southern District Court of New York to drop the case against the mayor, saying it affected his ability to cooperate with Trump’s sweeping deportation policies and seek reelection .

However, Awawdeh said that “New York City, under Mayor Eric Adams, is beholden to Donald Trump’s demands. “No new checks that New York State could impose on New York City will fix that issue, “ he told Caribbean Life. “ Eric Adams sold out New Yorkers to avoid prosecution for corruption charges in a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration, plain and simple. “No new checks that New York State could impose on New York City will fix that issue, “ he told Caribbean Life. “ Eric Adams sold out New Yorkers to avoid prosecution for corruption charges in a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration, plain and simple. “Now, he is working with the Trump administration to separate families in New York City in direct violation of our local sanctuary policies, “ Awawdeh added. “All New Yorkers will face real and dire consequences from Gov.  Hochul’s refusal to hold the mayor accountable for his actions. “Now, he is working with the Trump administration to separate families in New York City in direct violation of our local sanctuary policies, “ Awawdeh added. “All New Yorkers will face real and dire consequences from Gov.  Hochul’s refusal to hold the mayor accountable for his actions. “The people will not remain silent in the face of the threat posed by Eric Adams to immigrant New Yorkers, “ he continued. “The people will not remain silent in the face of the threat posed by Eric Adams to immigrant New Yorkers, “ he continued. Amid Adams’s collusion with Trump, Caribbean and other immigrant advocates in New York have urged the city workforce not to collude with ICE agents. “At a time when New Yorkers cannot rely on their mayor to follow the law, others in the Adams administration must step up, “ Awawdeh urged. “Mayor Adams may view his own participation in Trump’s mass deportation agenda as a get out of jail free card, but the actions he will be directing his subordinates to take to collude with ICE are both legally dubious and morally corrupt. “We are calling on all remaining deputy mayors, city agency commissioners, and city workers within the Adams administration to not comply with any orders to collaborate with ICE from this mayor, who remains compromised in his ability to put the needs and the safety of New Yorkers ahead of his own, “ he added.

I want to take this moment to say thank you for allowing me to be a part of such an uplifting, gracious, and awesome Power Women of Brooklyn event on Thursday, September 19, 2024.   I am so very appreciative of you and your team at Schneps Media for hosting such a well planned and professionally executed event that honored women.  The event gave me a much needed break while spending quality time with my friends and family on an unforgettable night.  Every detail of the event was well thought out and expertly managed from the ticketing process, the marketing of the event, the venue, parking, red carpet, check-in, food variety, beverages, staff, decor, photography, seating, posters on the table, entertainment, the beautiful trophy, right down to the post event recap.     If the goal of the event was to make us women feel special, appreciated and like a Queen for at least a day then for me, you went above and beyond the goal.  And, you did so with style, class and grace.  Once again, my sincere appreciation to you, Victoria Schneps and your entire team at Schneps Media for an outstanding job!

Patterson. REUTERS/Andrew Winning Africa and the Caribbean must face a decisive moment: build their own digital future or become forever digital servants in someone else’s empire. This is the resounding message coming from the PJ Patterson Institute, which continues to advocate for a sustainable place in the global affairs of technologies and AI dominance. The strong call also follows the recently held symposium on “Educational Transformation in Africa and the Caribbean,” held at the University of the West Indies. “We dare not wait patiently for the developed and powerful to decide our fate according to their national interest,” declared PJ Patterson, former prime minister of Jamaica and Statesman-in-Residence. Thus, the PJ Patterson Institute for Africa-Caribbean Advocacy will implement an AI-powered pilot project to enhance education and promote development and prosperity in both regions. The Stateman-in-Residence made the announcement during the celebration of his 90th birthday at the PJ Institute at the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies on the weekend of April 12, 2025.

Email Sign Up According to the former prime minister, the PJ Patterson Institution is working tirelessly to complete the planning and execution of a pilot project for an AI center that would promote research, education, technical advancement, and the growth of new industries in Africa and the Caribbean. Patterson said the formal establishment and collaboration with Afreximbank will be declared in early June 2025. The former prime minister further emphasized that education “has to be catapulted as the most formidable weapon in our arsenal for progress in a world where we have been, for ages, victims of human savagery and exploitation of our natural resources.” He noted that the PJ Patterson Institute has determined that this crisis of catastrophic uncertainties and worldwide turmoil “oblige us to make these the best times and no longer the worst.” In continuing to demonstrate  the need to develop the tools to revolutionize this transformation for future generations, Patterson  added, “As we build on the rich heritage of our pioneering advances in mathematics, medicine, architecture, and philosophy, we must not shirk the challenges to empower this and future generations with the tools to navigate and shape the global technological landscape.” Patterson urged the audience and told them there was no choice. “Our jobs must include high-value-added outputs and the use of our natural resources as equity investments in global initiatives.” Not mincing words, Patterson said that the next world war will not be with guns but with code. “We dare not wait patiently for the developed and powerful to decide our fate according to their national interest.” Patterson noted that the effort is symbolic of the Caribbean’s relationship with Africa, “deliberately designed by us as free people of sovereign nations.” In collaboration with Afreximbank, an AI Hub will be finalized to advance education, research, and technological innovation across both regions. “It will be grounded on recognizing our capacities, endowments, overlaps, and comparative advantages. It will reflect our determination to occupy and enjoy our rightful place on the single planet where all humankind must equitably share and inhabit together in its stewardship to dwell in peace and prosperity, Mr. Patterson concluded.

Gibson issued a sharp rebuke of the Trump administration’s recent decision to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants, calling the move “shameful” and “un-American.” In a statement released Friday, Gibson said the policy change—which affects migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela—would disproportionately impact communities of color and weaken the social fabric of immigrant neighborhoods throughout the Bronx and beyond. “The Trump Administration’s decision to revoke the temporary legal status of over half a million migrants is a nefarious attempt to distract from policy failures and further undermine communities of color,” Gibson said. “Targeting our most vulnerable groups is shameful and un-American. This destabilizing move will make our communities less safe, not more. Our neighbors who hail from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela deserve far better than this, and The Bronx stands united with them and all other immigrant groups that have been targeted by this administration.” Close Get the Full Story News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up Temporary Protected Status is a federal program that allows migrants from certain countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions to live and work legally in the United States for a limited period. The administration’s move to end TPS for these four countries could result in mass deportations and the uprooting of families. Gibson’s statement aligns with other elected officials and advocacy groups who have condemned the decision and called for protections to be reinstated through congressional action. The Bronx, one of the most diverse counties in the nation, is home to large immigrant communities from each of the affected countries. Many TPS recipients in the borough are small business owners and parents of U.S.-born children.

King Posted on April 17, 2025 City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams.

Photo courtesy Office of City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams New York City Council on Tuesday, April 15, filed a lawsuit requesting a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction against Mayor Eric Adams’ Executive Order 50 allowing Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to operate an office on Rikers Island Correctional Facility that would facilitate the deportation of Caribbean and other immigrants. The executive order was issued by First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro on April 8. The lawsuit contends that the executive order is “unlawful, tainted by the conflict of interest created by the corrupt bargain the mayor entered into – his personal freedom in exchange for an ICE office. “The law is clear that the mayor is unable to cure that conflict of interest simply by delegating his authority to open an ICE office to Deputy Mayor Mastro,” it says. In seeking an immediate halt of any associated activity, the lawsuit outlines how the “unlawful action” would undermine public safety in New York City by eroding trust between local government, including local law enforcement and New Yorkers.

Email Sign Up It also argues that the mayor never delegated the specified duty to Mastro, as required by the City Charter. “Once again, this City Council is standing firm to protect the rights and safety of all New Yorkers against attacks by the Trump administration — because the city’s mayor won’t stop placing his own personal interests ahead of the people of our city,” said Speaker Adrienne Adams, a candidate for Mayor of the City of New York in June’s Democratic Primary. “Mayor Eric Adams clearly indicated his intention for this executive order when the Trump administration attempted to dismiss his corruption case in what prosecutors and Judge Ho saw as a quid pro quo. “The mayor has compromised our city’s sovereignty and is now threatening the safety of all New Yorkers, which is why we are filing this lawsuit to halt his illegal order that he shamelessly previewed on the Fox News couch with Tom Homan,” she added. “When New Yorkers are afraid of cooperating with our city’s own police, and discouraged from reporting crime and seeking help, it makes everyone in our city less safe. “This is a naked attempt by Eric Adams to fulfill his end of the bargain for special treatment he received from the Trump administration,” Speaker Adams continued. “New York cannot afford its mayor colluding with the Trump administration to violate the law, and this lawsuit looks to the court to uphold the basic standard of democracy, even if our mayor won’t.” The City Council said that on the same day that Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) ordered Adams’ federal corruption case dismissed without prejudice, the mayor met with Trump’s border czar Tom Homan and expressed his intention to invite ICE onto Rikers via executive order. “The political intervention in the corruption case led several top federal prosecutors to resign and assert the actions amounted to a quid pro quo,” it said. The Council noted that Federal Judge Dale Ho, who declined to immediately dismiss the case and sought independent arguments, indicated that “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.” The City Council said the executive order pertains to Local Law 58 of 2014 that prevents federal immigration authorities from maintaining an office on Rikers Island. Last week, the Council passed Resolution 836, authorizing Speaker Adams to take legal action to defend against the mayoral administration’s violation of Sanctuary Laws and the Trump administration’s attacks on the City of New York. “Mayor Adams’ willingness to trade away our city’s safety in exchange for personal protection isn’t just outrageous—it’s dangerous and unlawful,” said Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala. “New Yorkers deserve a mayor that defends our city and communities, not one that invites chaos upon us. Speaker Adrienne Adams and the Council are doing exactly what this moment demands: standing up for New Yorkers against a mayor failing to be accountable to the people of our city,” she added. City Council Member Sandy Nurse, chair of the Committee on Criminal Justice, said, “Personal political deals should never dictate city policy, especially when they threaten rights as fundamental as due process and public safety. “This unlawful executive order sets a dangerous precedent and makes our city less safe,” she said. “Handing the keys of New York City government over to the Trump administration to dismantle New Yorkers’ rights cannot be allowed. We aren’t standing by while this corrupt deal unfolds – we will be fighting this in court and defending the integrity of our laws.” Another Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Committee on Immigration, said that, “Turning Rikers into an outpost for the Trump administration’s extreme agenda has nothing to do with protecting New Yorkers and everything to do with the mayor protecting himself. “Selling out our city’s diverse immigrant communities that built this city to Trump will make every New Yorker less safe,” she said. “The Council is taking this fight to court to defend our city when the mayor won’t and calling this what it is: a disgraceful and blatant quid pro quo.” The lawsuit says Executive Order 50 is “the poisoned fruit of Mayor Adams’ deal with the Trump administration: if the mayor cooperated with the administration’s immigration enforcement priorities, including by permitting ICE to operate on Rikers, the charges against him would be dismissed.” It also says that “The mayor’s decision to have Mastro issue the EO (executive order) on April 8, 2025, does not magically cleanse the taint of conflict from the order”. In addition, the lawsuit contends that “ICE has long been notorious for sweeping unintended targets into its enforcement activities, meaning that allowing ICE back onto Rikers for the purpose of criminal investigation purposes is only a short and slippery slope to civil immigration enforcement. “In fact, ICE routinely arrests immigrants who simply happen to be in the vicinity of its intended target, despite lacking a warrant or even probable cause with respect to those ‘collateral’ arrestees,” it says. “And it continues to do so in violation of a federal court order that limited this practice in 2022 but which it has flagrantly disregarded.” About the Author City Council sues Adams for allowing ICE to operate office on Rikers Island By Nelson A.

We aren’t standing by while this corrupt deal unfolds – we will be fighting this in court and defending the integrity of our laws.” Another Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Committee on Immigration, said that, “Turning Rikers into an outpost for the Trump administration’s extreme agenda has nothing to do with protecting New Yorkers and everything to do with the mayor protecting himself. “Selling out our city’s diverse immigrant communities that built this city to Trump will make every New Yorker less safe,” she said. “The Council is taking this fight to court to defend our city when the mayor won’t and calling this what it is: a disgraceful and blatant quid pro quo.” The lawsuit says Executive Order 50 is “the poisoned fruit of Mayor Adams’ deal with the Trump administration: if the mayor cooperated with the administration’s immigration enforcement priorities, including by permitting ICE to operate on Rikers, the charges against him would be dismissed.” It also says that “The mayor’s decision to have Mastro issue the EO (executive order) on April 8, 2025, does not magically cleanse the taint of conflict from the order”. In addition, the lawsuit contends that “ICE has long been notorious for sweeping unintended targets into its enforcement activities, meaning that allowing ICE back onto Rikers for the purpose of criminal investigation purposes is only a short and slippery slope to civil immigration enforcement. “In fact, ICE routinely arrests immigrants who simply happen to be in the vicinity of its intended target, despite lacking a warrant or even probable cause with respect to those ‘collateral’ arrestees,” it says. “And it continues to do so in violation of a federal court order that limited this practice in 2022 but which it has flagrantly disregarded.” The lawsuit contends that the executive order is “unlawful, tainted by the conflict of interest created by the corrupt bargain the mayor entered into – his personal freedom in exchange for an ICE office. “The law is clear that the mayor is unable to cure that conflict of interest simply by delegating his authority to open an ICE office to Deputy Mayor Mastro,” it says. In seeking an immediate halt of any associated activity, the lawsuit outlines how the “unlawful action” would undermine public safety in New York City by eroding trust between local government, including local law enforcement and New Yorkers.

The Council noted that Federal Judge Dale Ho, who declined to immediately dismiss the case and sought independent arguments, indicated that “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.” The City Council said the executive order pertains to Local Law 58 of 2014 that prevents federal immigration authorities from maintaining an office on Rikers Island. Last week, the Council passed Resolution 836, authorizing Speaker Adams to take legal action to defend against the mayoral administration’s violation of Sanctuary Laws and the Trump administration’s attacks on the City of New York. “Mayor Adams’ willingness to trade away our city’s safety in exchange for personal protection isn’t just outrageous—it’s dangerous and unlawful,” said Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala. “New Yorkers deserve a mayor that defends our city and communities, not one that invites chaos upon us.

Photo courtesy of NYCFC New York City FC (NYCFC) adds much-needed depth to the midfield with the signing of Australian international and midfielder Aiden O’Neill. Just two days after the MLS Primary Transfer Window closed, the club announced that the 26-year-old has signed with the Boys in Blue through the end of the 2028 Major League Soccer season. A defensive-minded, box-to-box midfielder with extensive leadership qualities and a tireless engine, O’Neill arrives in New York with over 185 professional appearances, including stints in the English Premier League, Belgian Pro-League, and the Australian A-League. “We are excited to welcome Aiden to New York City,” said NYCFC Sporting Director David Lee. “Aiden is a smart and powerful midfielder with a high work rate, bringing valuable European experience and leadership from his time as captain of Standard Liège.” Close Get amNY in your inbox! News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up Aiden O’Neill Photo courtesy of NYCFC For NYCFC, the signing is another signal of intent. O’Neill will look to push for a starting spot in an area of need for the squad. With Keaton Parks, Justin Haak, and Johnny Shore logging most of the minutes in central midfield, O’Neill’s inclusion will be helpful for a City side currently lingering in 10th place in the Eastern Conference. O’Neill’s professional soccer journey began in Brisbane, Australia, where he played youth soccer for Brisbane Athletic and the University of Queensland FC. As a teenager, he moved to England, where he joined Burnley FC’s youth academy. O’Neill would then go on to sign his first professional contract with the club in January 2016. From there, O’Neill went on to play for several teams, including Oldham Athletic, Fleetwood Town in England, the Central Coast Mariners and Brisbane Roar in his native Australia, and eventually Standard Liege in Belgium. Now, the midfielder is keen to call New York City home. Aiden O’Neill “I’m extremely excited to join New York City FC and to be back within City Football Group for this next chapter of my career,” O’Neill said . “I’ve heard incredible things about the organization and the city, and I can’t wait to get started and meet everyone. I’m especially looking forward to playing in front of the passionate New York City fan base and giving them a reason to cheer as we compete for trophies.” The Australian joins NYCFC at a pivotal time. With midseason approaching, the Pigeons were in desperate need of a midfield reinforcement, particularly with the winter departures of James Sands and Santiago Rodriguez. Under head coach Pascal Jansen, O’Neill will likely be deployed as a defensive midfielder alongside Parks in the team’s usual 4-2-3-1. His arrival could provide dynamism, extra depth, and technical ability in the center of the field — something the team has been missing. “I’d describe myself as a hardworking, box-to-box midfielder who’s all about the collective—always ready to give absolutely everything on-and-off the pitch,” he continued. “This is an ambitious Club representing one of the greatest cities in the world, and I’m looking forward to making my mark.” About the Author NYCFC signs Australian midfielder Aiden O’Neill through the 2028 MLS season By Alex Windley By Alex Windley Posted on April 25, 2025 Posted on New York City FC (NYCFC) adds much-needed depth to the midfield with the signing of Australian international and midfielder Aiden O’Neill. Just two days after the MLS Primary Transfer Window closed, the club announced that the 26-year-old has signed with the Boys in Blue through the end of the 2028 Major League Soccer season. A defensive-minded, box-to-box midfielder with extensive leadership qualities and a tireless engine, O’Neill arrives in New York with over 185 professional appearances, including stints in the English Premier League, Belgian Pro-League, and the Australian A-League. “We are excited to welcome Aiden to New York City,” said NYCFC Sporting Director David Lee. “Aiden is a smart and powerful midfielder with a high work rate, bringing valuable European experience and leadership from his time as captain of Standard Liège.” Close Get amNY in your inbox! News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up Aiden O’Neill Photo courtesy of NYCFC For NYCFC, the signing is another signal of intent. O’Neill will look to push for a starting spot in an area of need for the squad. With Keaton Parks, Justin Haak, and Johnny Shore logging most of the minutes in central midfield, O’Neill’s inclusion will be helpful for a City side currently lingering in 10th place in the Eastern Conference. O’Neill’s professional soccer journey began in Brisbane, Australia, where he played youth soccer for Brisbane Athletic and the University of Queensland FC. As a teenager, he moved to England, where he joined Burnley FC’s youth academy. O’Neill would then go on to sign his first professional contract with the club in January 2016. From there, O’Neill went on to play for several teams, including Oldham Athletic, Fleetwood Town in England, the Central Coast Mariners and Brisbane Roar in his native Australia, and eventually Standard Liege in Belgium. Now, the midfielder is keen to call New York City home. Aiden O’Neill “I’m extremely excited to join New York City FC and to be back within City Football Group for this next chapter of my career,” O’Neill said . “I’ve heard incredible things about the organization and the city, and I can’t wait to get started and meet everyone. I’m especially looking forward to playing in front of the passionate New York City fan base and giving them a reason to cheer as we compete for trophies.” The Australian joins NYCFC at a pivotal time. With midseason approaching, the Pigeons were in desperate need of a midfield reinforcement, particularly with the winter departures of James Sands and Santiago Rodriguez.

Adrian Dennis/Pool via REUTERS A Washington DC-based non-governmental organization (NGO) has released documents alleging the Cuban government gets the hog of the pay of medical professionals working in the Caribbean, appearing to back up assertions by the Trump administration that Havana is efficiently working around economic sanctions imposed by the US decades ago. The Free Society Project, or Archivo Cuba, recently released data from research into the scheme under which Cuban doctors, nurses, and other professionals work overseas through bilateral arrangements with governments. Details of what is contained in the agreement with most central authorities have scarcely been released. However, the Bahamas Tribune newspaper reported extensively on the document released by the NGO this week. It says the professionals take home only about 16 % of the pay assigned to each worker, with the rest going to the Cuban government via a scheme that Washington had deemed as human trafficking. The Trump administration has raised the issue with various governments in the region recently, even threatening to revoke visas for government and other officials because they were allegedly encouraging forced labor and trafficking. However, the feedback from the area was overwhelmingly in favor of the US doing what it has to do. At the same time, the Cubans will continue to work in regional health centers because they are filling a crucial gap in health care delivery. Critics also argued that the US has made no offer to replace those professionals if they have to leave. Close Stay Connected to the Caribbean Get the latest news and updates delivered to your inbox. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up “The documents, leaked by the Cuba Archive, suggest that while The Bahamas agreed in 2023 to pay thousands of dollars per month for each Cuban health worker, the professionals received monthly stipends ranging from $990 to $1,200. Between 84 and 92 %, it appears to have gone to Comercializadora de Servicios Médicos Cubanos, SA (CSMC), the Cuban state agency that manages overseas deployments,” the paper stated. Asked to comment, Health Minister Mike Darville said he was not sure about the accuracy of the documents but promised to compare them with official records. Several governments, including Guyana, Antigua, and The Bahamas, have publicly offered to review the contractual arrangements to determine whether there are hints of trafficking or exploitation of any kind. And speaking recently to reporters, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali noted that “we have said to the US if there is any particular information or any specific issue that they wish for us to address, we are more than willing to work with them because, as you know, the US is a very important partner also for Guyana and we work closely together on many issues.” About the Author Cuban doctors stiffed By Bert Wilkinson By Bert Wilkinson Posted on April 23, 2025 Posted on A Washington DC-based non-governmental organization (NGO) has released documents alleging the Cuban government gets the hog of the pay of medical professionals working in the Caribbean, appearing to back up assertions by the Trump administration that Havana is efficiently working around economic sanctions imposed by the US decades ago.

And speaking recently to reporters, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali noted that “we have said to the US if there is any particular information or any specific issue that they wish for us to address, we are more than willing to work with them because, as you know, the US is a very important partner also for Guyana and we work closely together on many issues.” Several governments, including Guyana, Antigua, and The Bahamas, have publicly offered to review the contractual arrangements to determine whether there are hints of trafficking or exploitation of any kind.

File photo by Barbara Russo-Lennon The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is hosting a series of pop-up events across Queens and select locations in Brooklyn to help bus riders prepare for major service changes set to take effect this summer as part of the Queens Bus Network Redesign. The outreach campaign began earlier this week with events in Jamaica and continues through May 22. At each pop-up, MTA representatives are stationed at transit hubs and community locations to answer questions, provide route-specific information, and distribute brochures about the redesign. This Saturday, April 26, will be at Green Acres Mall from 4 to 6 p.m., and on Tuesday, April 29, at Queensborough Community College from 1 to 3 p.m., followed by the Queens Village LIRR station from 4 to 6 p.m. The Queens Bus Network Redesign, one of the largest transit overhauls in decades, will be rolled out in two phases this summer. Phase One begins Sunday, June 29 , and includes the launch of 16 new routes, changes to 67 existing routes, and the elimination of five routes. Phase Two follows on Sunday, August 31, introducing one new route, changes to 37 routes, and the discontinuation of one route. Altogether, the final plan includes 124 routes—94 local and 30 express—up from the current 113. Close Get the Full Story News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up As part of its outreach, the MTA is encouraging riders to explore new planning tools available on mta.info/queensbus . These tools include a route look-up feature with integrated Google Translate, a Remix interactive map to preview changes by route or location, and a Future Trip Planner to visualize trips under the redesigned system. “Customers can use these resources to understand how their daily commute may change and what options are available to them once the new system is in place,” the agency said in a statement. The MTA will continue distributing printed materials and staffing key bus stops with uniformed employees throughout April and May. Meanwhile, the NYC Department of Transportation is updating signage at bus stops to reflect the changes ahead of launch. Passengers are encouraged to sign up for service alerts to receive real-time updates about their routes, including when the changes take effect. Alerts are also available for subway, LIRR, and Metro-North service, as well as elevator and escalator outages. The redesign is part of the MTA’s broader effort to modernize and improve service across the borough, with an emphasis on reliability, frequency, and better connections to subways and key destinations.

Photo courtesy Troy Blackwell The Trump-Vance administration has made one thing clear in its first 100 days: the Caribbean is no longer a priority — unless it’s about deportations, trade crackdowns, or pulling aid. For those of us in New York City, home to the largest Caribbean diaspora in the United States, this isn’t just foreign policy. It’s personal. Across Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens, Caribbean Americans are watching as the hard-won ties between our communities and our homelands are quietly unraveled. In the name of “America First,” this administration has paused critical development aid, accelerated deportations, and threatened economic stability in the region — all while ignoring the interconnectedness that binds the Caribbean and the U.S. together. In January, President Trump signed Executive Order 14169, pausing all non-emergency foreign development assistance. For Caribbean nations that rely on U.S. support to strengthen healthcare, build climate resilience, and recover from natural disasters, this freeze is devastating. And while some in Washington frame this as a “cost-saving measure,” the reality is that pulling aid from small island nations doesn’t just hurt those abroad — it ripples through communities right here in New York. Many of us have family back home. We send remittances, help rebuild after hurricanes, support small businesses, and advocate for immigration relief. When our home countries struggle, we feel it — emotionally, financially, and politically. When Trump cuts aid to Jamaica or the Dominican Republic, it means local clinics lose funding, jobs disappear, and people have fewer options — often leading them to migrate here under even more desperate conditions. At the same time, the administration’s hardline immigration agenda is fueling fear and uncertainty in our boroughs. The threat of mass deportations looms large, especially for Caribbean nationals who are longtime residents but may lack full legal status. The administration’s calls to ramp up removals, including of individuals with minor or decades-old infractions, are tearing families apart and overburdening already stretched community resources. Let’s be clear: this is not about public safety. It’s about racialized enforcement — and the Caribbean is a target. Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio renewed his attacks on Cuba’s international medical diplomacy, accusing the country of “medical trafficking.” That might sound like foreign policy business, but here in New York, many of us grew up hearing stories of Cuban doctors saving lives across the region. These programs, while imperfect, filled critical gaps in underserved areas. Now, even those shared legacies are being politicized. What’s most troubling, however, is that the administration’s stance doesn’t seem to recognize — or value — the deep-rooted relationship between the U.S. and the Caribbean. Over 4.5 million Caribbean immigrants and their descendants live in the United States. New York City alone is home to more than 1 million Caribbean Americans. We are educators, nurses, transit workers, business owners, and community leaders. We have contributed to this country in every way imaginable — and yet our histories, our struggles, and our futures are being sidelined. This neglect doesn’t just show up in policy — it shows up in silence. When Caribbean leaders call for fairer trade terms or a voice in climate adaptation, Washington barely blinks. When the Dominican Republic faces rising energy insecurity or Haiti cries out for help rebuilding democratic institutions, U.S. engagement is inconsistent at best, and paternalistic at worst. And when our communities here in the U.S. advocate for more inclusive immigration reform, investment in Caribbean neighborhoods, or economic equity, we’re told to wait our turn — or worse, that our concerns don’t matter. Well, they do. The Caribbean is not a geopolitical afterthought — it is a vital part of the Americas. And the diaspora is not a silent voting bloc — we are a force that shapes elections, culture, and economies. As someone with roots in the region, as a former senior Biden-Harris administration official, and as a proud New Yorker, I urge our elected leaders — especially in Congress and at the city level — to pay attention. We need public pressure to restore foreign aid to the Caribbean, protect immigrants from harmful enforcement actions, and build stronger economic and cultural partnerships that recognize our shared destiny. And to our Caribbean American communities here in New York: this is our moment to organize, to speak up, and to remind this administration — and the next — that we are watching, voting, and building a better future for our families on both sides of the sea. ** Troy Blackwell is a former advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris, was President Biden’s Deputy Chief Communications Officer at the U.S. Department of Commerce, and served as the Global Spokesperson for the U.S. Peace Corps.

Photo by Tracey Khan Renee Davis , a proud first-generation Trinidadian-American and former nurse, is spicing up Long Island with her homeland’s bold, irresistible flavors through her fast-rising food venture, Trini Bites . What started as a pandemic pop-up has exploded into a buzzing catering business — and she’s just getting started. With pots simmering and plans brewing, Davis is on a mission to take Trini Bites to the next level and bring Caribbean flavor to even more tables. Davis’s journey into the food industry departed from her initial career path. “Growing up in a Trinidadian household in Flatbush, the idea was that you had to go into a field that was secure and safe,” Davis said. “So I went into nursing.” However, the desire to explore her culinary passions lingered. The move from Brooklyn to Long Island 13 years ago with her family, coupled with the limited availability of Trinidadian food on the Island, provided the spark. “We noticed very quickly that there were minimal options for Trinidadian food here on the Island,” Davis explained.

Email Sign Up Renee Davis, owner of Trini Bites and a former nurse, has turned her passion for food into a growing culinary business. Photo by Tracey Khan The idea for Trini Bites took root in January 2021. Davis started small, launching pop-up shops while still working in nursing. She found a commercial kitchen in Lynbrook, which she saw as a sign to pursue her dream. Trini Bites began serving the community in June 2021. Taste, Legacy & Leadership with Chef Marcus Samuelsson Schneps Connects https://podcasts.schnepsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MARCUS-SAUMLESSON-EDITED.mp3 Subscribe: RSS iTunes Spotify Stitcher Amazon Google Play The response was enthusiastic. “It was very well received by the community,” Davis said. Trini Bites quickly gained a following, leading to a feature in Newsday highlighting the arrival of Trinidadian food on Long Island. Davis pointed out that Trini Bites is one of the few Trinidadian cuisines available in Nassau County. In 2022, Trini Bites expanded with a food truck, becoming the first exclusively Trinidadian food truck on Long Island. Davis juggled cooking, driving, cleaning, and maintaining the truck , serving at public events, festivals, and private gatherings like weddings and birthday parties. A significant milestone came in 2024 with Trini Bites’ acceptance into Smorgasburg, the renowned outdoor food market. Davis, a longtime Smorgasburg patron, recognized the absence of Trinidadian cuisine among the diverse offerings. “I said, you know, why aren’t there any Trinny places in Smorgasburg? Like, it seems like it would be a no-brainer,” she recalled. Under the “Doubles or Nothing” moniker (a nod to her mother’s love of casino games), Trini Bites introduced doubles — a popular Trinidadian street food — to Smorgasburg. The experience proved invaluable, providing Davis with connections and partnerships. Trini Bites caters events across Long Island and New York City, serving art galleries, schools, universities, offices, and corporate clients. Photo by Tracey khan Trini Bites is now focusing on its catering arm, which has grown significantly. Davis and her team cater to art galleries, offices, schools, universities, and corporate clients across Long Island and New York City. “I did not imagine that the brand would go this far, especially being pretty much a solopreneur,” she said. While her husband provides occasional support, Davis manages much of the business herself, from cooking and delivering to accounting and client relations. The challenges of being a solopreneur, particularly funding and staffing, are significant, according to Davis. “I need more hands, but at the same time, you know, building the business out even more so that I can get more sales and more revenue to afford more hands,” she said. Despite the challenges, Davis desires to share her culture and connect with her community. She emphasizes the importance of preserving Trinidadian traditions for her children, who are second-generation Trinidadian-Americans. “It was very important, I realized, as this business evolved, to keep it going, even just for them, so they can see what this food is about,” she said. Davis envisions a future storefront, perhaps a more upscale take on traditional Trinidadian cuisine. For now, she remains focused on growing the catering business and encouraging people to experience the flavors of Trini Bites. About the Author A Taste of Trinidad on Long Island: Trini Bites brings Caribbean flavor to the suburbs By Tracey Khan By Tracey Khan Posted on April 21, 2025 Posted on Renee Davis , a proud first-generation Trinidadian-American and former nurse, is spicing up Long Island with her homeland’s bold, irresistible flavors through her fast-rising food venture, Trini Bites . What started as a pandemic pop-up has exploded into a buzzing catering business — and she’s just getting started. With pots simmering and plans brewing, Davis is on a mission to take Trini Bites to the next level and bring Caribbean flavor to even more tables. Renee Davis , a proud first-generation Trinidadian-American and former nurse, is spicing up Long Island with her homeland’s bold, irresistible flavors through her fast-rising food venture, Trini Bites . What started as a pandemic pop-up has exploded into a buzzing catering business — and she’s just getting started. With pots simmering and plans brewing, Davis is on a mission to take Trini Bites to the next level and bring Caribbean flavor to even more tables. Davis’s journey into the food industry departed from her initial career path. “Growing up in a Trinidadian household in Flatbush, the idea was that you had to go into a field that was secure and safe,” Davis said. “So I went into nursing.” However, the desire to explore her culinary passions lingered. The move from Brooklyn to Long Island 13 years ago with her family, coupled with the limited availability of Trinidadian food on the Island, provided the spark. “We noticed very quickly that there were minimal options for Trinidadian food here on the Island,” Davis explained.

Email Sign Up Renee Davis, owner of Trini Bites and a former nurse, has turned her passion for food into a growing culinary business. Photo by Tracey Khan The idea for Trini Bites took root in January 2021. Davis started small, launching pop-up shops while still working in nursing. She found a commercial kitchen in Lynbrook, which she saw as a sign to pursue her dream. Trini Bites began serving the community in June 2021.

Trini Bites quickly gained a following, leading to a feature in Newsday highlighting the arrival of Trinidadian food on Long Island. Davis pointed out that Trini Bites is one of the few Trinidadian cuisines available in Nassau County. In 2022, Trini Bites expanded with a food truck, becoming the first exclusively Trinidadian food truck on Long Island. Davis juggled cooking, driving, cleaning, and maintaining the truck , serving at public events, festivals, and private gatherings like weddings and birthday parties. A significant milestone came in 2024 with Trini Bites’ acceptance into Smorgasburg, the renowned outdoor food market. Davis, a longtime Smorgasburg patron, recognized the absence of Trinidadian cuisine among the diverse offerings. “I said, you know, why aren’t there any Trinny places in Smorgasburg? Like, it seems like it would be a no-brainer,” she recalled. Under the “Doubles or Nothing” moniker (a nod to her mother’s love of casino games), Trini Bites introduced doubles — a popular Trinidadian street food — to Smorgasburg. The experience proved invaluable, providing Davis with connections and partnerships. Trini Bites caters events across Long Island and New York City, serving art galleries, schools, universities, offices, and corporate clients.

In one era, it came from labor unions and factory floors. In another, from trading desks and corporate towers. But today, as inequality deepens and public trust wears thin, we’re confronted with a basic question: who is the economy for? For more than two decades in the State Senate, I’ve tried to answer that question through legislation, oversight, and budget negotiations. I represent a Brooklyn district where working families make the city run, but where they are too often shut out of the benefits of growth. This tension—between the value produced by everyday New Yorkers and the rewards concentrated elsewhere—has only grown more stark. When the gains of our economy are disproportionately captured by a small group of firms and investors, and when our public dollars reinforce that pattern, we have a responsibility to act. Public investment is not a neutral exercise. It reflects a set of priorities. We subsidize stadiums while subway stations crumble. We grant tax abatements to luxury developments while small landlords struggle to maintain basic infrastructure. We allow city and state contracts to cycle through the same corporate vendors while Black- and Latino-owned businesses are told to wait their turn. Much of my work in Albany has focused on shifting those priorities. I’ve advanced legislation to strengthen access to capital for minority- and women-owned businesses. I’ve sponsored bills to improve how the state tracks and enforces equity in contracting. I’ve pushed for energy policy that does not just reduce emissions, but lowers costs for working-class households. The state’s climate goals mean little if families in East Flatbush or the South Bronx are left paying more for less reliable service.

Email Sign Up In 2023, I helped lead efforts to expand community solar programs, allowing lower-income households to benefit directly from the energy transition. I’ve worked on green jobs training programs that prepare young people for careers in infrastructure, technology, and the trades—not just degrees that come with debt. But even these wins feel incomplete when measured against the size of the problem. Small businesses, especially in communities of color, still face steep barriers to credit and procurement. Public housing continues to deteriorate while capital funds remain tied up in bureaucracy. Our pension funds—massive as they are—remain tethered to underperforming or politically toxic investments, as if no alternative exists. That’s why I joined recent calls for the State Comptroller to divest public pension dollars from Tesla. The issue is not just stock volatility or Elon Musk’s behavior. It’s whether the public sector should reward companies that defy labor norms, undercut sustainability goals, and openly attack democratic values. Our investments must align with our ethics—and reflect a commitment to long-term value over short-term hype. This principle extends beyond any one company. We need clearer standards for where our public funds go. That means more robust environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. It means transparency around fund managers, consultants, and fees. It means actively seeking investments that build housing, improve broadband access, expand child care, and create jobs in the neighborhoods that need them most. Budget justice is not a slogan. It is a framework. And it demands we look not just at how much we spend, but who benefits. As Chair of the Senate Energy Committee, I’ve seen how quickly state agencies and private utilities move when there is pressure from capital markets—and how slowly they move when accountability is only measured in hearings and audits. The public sector must learn to think with the urgency of private industry, but with values that serve the public good. We can do this. We can modernize procurement, invest in green infrastructure, and partner with mission-driven lenders and community development institutions. We can fund startups that hire locally, and nonprofits that solve problems at scale. We can make data public and spending traceable. None of this is radical. It’s overdue. Too often, New York’s working class is treated as an afterthought—essential during crises, expendable in recovery. A just economy flips that script. It recognizes that dignity is not a derivative of profit. It’s the starting point. This is the work I’ve tried to do throughout my career. Not from the podium, but from budget tables, committee rooms, and site visits. Shifting from Wall Street to Main Street is not about punishing success. It’s about ensuring that prosperity in this city is not defined by ZIP code or zoning map. The city we want—resilient, fair, and functional—won’t come from waiting on the next tech boom. It will come from investments that meet people where they are, and policies that follow through. We have the tools. What we need now is the will. State Senator Kevin Parker represents the 21st District in the New York State Senate, where he serves as Chair of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee and leads efforts to advance economic and environmental equity across the state.

Gonsalves. United Nations / Ryan Brown Leaders from several Eastern Caribbean countries, which raise hundreds of millions in state revenues by selling passports and local citizenship to foreigners, are meeting in an emergency session in Antigua this week amid pressure from Western nations to improve transparency or to scrap such programs altogether. With the collapse of banana and other exports to Europe and threats to slap a 10 % tariff on exports to the US, the summit is being held to refine systems that could prove to Europe and the US that the Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) awards passports and citizenship to people of decent backgrounds. Officials say the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank is assisting the governments of St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Grenada, Dominica, and Antigua in tabling and approving harmonized legislation that would help improve due diligence systems for people applying for passports and citizenship by investing as little as $100,000 in real estate and other ventures. The meeting, which began on Tuesday, ends on Saturday. Close Stay Connected to the Caribbean Get the latest news and updates delivered to your inbox. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up The bloc of nations, except St. Vincent, has been under increasing pressure from the West to scrutinize applicants’ backgrounds in the wake of a few cases where people of dubious backgrounds could obtain passports and travel visa-free to Western nations. Once discovered, officials said their travel documents were immediately canceled. Summit planners say the conference is very timely even as the US Trump administration is offering a similar scheme. “We are exceedingly pleased that this summit will provide a platform for all stakeholders to increase their awareness of the advancements made on the regional regulatory body for the programs, which is being spearheaded by the Central Bank in collaboration with the OECS Commission,” Charmaine Donovan, Chief Executive of the Antiguan CIP program told reporters this week.” The interim regulatory committee has been established and is well underway with developing the appropriate legislation and administrative framework. These programs are a significant revenue source for our economies, and we continue to demonstrate individually and collectively our commitment to continuously improving our programs to secure long-term sustainability,” she said. As the summit continued, Vincentian Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves restated his simmering opposition to the scheme, suggesting it would never operate under a Unity Labor Party (ULP) administration. “I have warned this country about the dangers of selling our passports and citizenship. I don’t want to go through all the arguments now, because you know them, if you’re listening to me, I said I’m opposed to selling the passports and the citizenship,” said on a recent radio program. “In principle, I’m opposed on the grounds of practicality. I’m opposed on the ground that it is not sustainable and that it is reckless to run your country’s finances on selling passports and citizenship.” He argued that continuing the program could result in visa-free travel for the OECS being canceled as the US, the UK, and Canada have all demanded the cancellation of the CIP scheme. “You have to apply for a visa now from certain of those countries, and the Europeans now have put it inside of their parliament. The European Union parliament has already addressed that question and is going through the parliamentary process. It’s just a matter of time. I saw it coming. It took a little longer to give them some time to clean up.” About the Author St. Vincent remains opposed to selling passports By Bert Wilkinson By Bert Wilkinson Posted on April 25, 2025 Posted on Leaders from several Eastern Caribbean countries, which raise hundreds of millions in state revenues by selling passports and local citizenship to foreigners, are meeting in an emergency session in Antigua this week amid pressure from Western nations to improve transparency or to scrap such programs altogether.

Email Sign Up Bowman – a perennial finalist in the Calypso Monarch Competition in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for Vincy Mas, the national carnival, and member of the Dynamites Calypso Tent – ripped patrons with “Afro Caribbean” “Instructions “ and “Wine Come Up “ from his vast repertoire. Bowman is renowned for mesmerizing calypso aficionados and the party crowd wherever he performs. He is also known for this special tribute song to the late Ulric Jones, Jr., popularly known as “Soca Jones, “ a prominent Vincentian entertainment promoter in Brooklyn and co-founder and former vice chairman of the massive Vincy Day USA picnic that is held annually on the third Saturday in August, at Heckscher State Park in East Islip, Long Island. “It’s a song he would have loved very much, “ Bowman, who penned, sang, and created a video on “True Champion – Tribute to Soca Jones, “ to the tune of one of the hits of Trinidad and Tobago’s calypso icon, Baron, told Caribbean Life. “The hook allows a perfect play on Soca (Jones) himself, and he loved working along with Caribbean artistes, “ added Bowman, a former lead vocalist with the defunct Vincentian bands E nergy, Blaksand, and X-tract. Garifuna drummers perform at the Induction Ceremony. Photo by Nelson A. King “Soca Jones was a people’s man; he was continuously involved in all Vincy activities – be it sporting, cultural, or educational; in all aspects of Vincy life, both at home and in the Diaspora; and he was definitely an ambassador for SVG (St. Vincent and the Grenadines), “ continued Bowman, who won the 1997 Vincy Soca Monarch title with “Voom, Voom. “ “ Soca (Jones) was an individual whose contributions were felt and appreciated and would leave a massive void to fill, “ he said. “Given his indomitable spirit, he would not be easy to replace. And, for many years to come, that void, created by his absence, will surely be felt.” In introducing “True Champion – Tribute to Soca Jones, “ Bowman described the entertainment promoter as “a true patriot, “ adding: “I personally would like to thank you for all the kind words of encouragement that you’ve offered me.” For the lyrics, Bowman sings partially: “Soca Jones, you’re a true Vincy champion/We love the way how you embrace the Soca Land/Rain or sun, you are always representing/In many ways, you are more than a Soca King/ “Such a champion, you are the real Soca Man, “ he sings. “Always willing and ready to lend a hand/You have touched many lives in our nation/All ah Vincy thank you for your contribution/Soca, you love your people/You love St. Vincent and the Grenadines with all your heart/And like Fya Empress say, ‘You’re a true, true Vincy. ‘” East 95th Street and Church Avenue, considered the hub of Vincentian entertainment in Brooklyn, was frequented by Jones. In earlier years, he served as Master of Ceremonies in the pre-Labor Day Vincy Carnival jam. Bowman was ecstatic about his performance Saturday night. “I enjoyed my performance, “ he told Caribbean Life. “And it’s always a pleasure doing this for any organization out of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.” Among other performers Saturday night were Garifuna drummers.

Chairman José Francisco Ávila (left) was among those to receive a signed copy of “The Banks We Deserve” from Author Oscar Perry Abello (right). Photo courtesy of Ponce Bank Oscar Perry Abello, the author of the new book “ The Banks We Deserve: Reclaiming Community Banking for a Just Economy ,” recently held a book signing, public reading and a discussion on the future of finance and banking across New York State and the United States at the Ponce Bank branch at 2244 Westchester Ave. in the Bronx. Abello’s book urges readers to critically examine who the financial system is truly designed to serve. It invites a reimagining of banking—one that places people, communities, and long-term impact at its core. Through compelling stories from across the country, Abello highlights how community-focused institutions like Ponce Bank are redefining access to capital, promoting economic resilience, and reaching individuals often overlooked by larger banks—all while maintaining financial strength and accountability. The discussion Abello participated in at Ponce Bank centered on the critical role community banks play in addressing the economic and financial needs of residents from all backgrounds—particularly those living in underserved communities.

Email Sign Up Among those in attendance for the public reading, audience Q&A, and book signing were select customers, nonprofit partners, and community members. Many attendees found Abello’s stories relatable, reflecting their own experiences and challenges. By the end of the event, guests walked away with a stronger understanding of how community banks function—and a renewed appreciation for their essential role in fostering economic inclusion and resilience. “Oscar’s work puts words to what we live every day,” Ponce Bank Vice President and Director of Nonprofit Services Wanda Matos said. The message of the book and the accompanying discussion strongly resonated with Ponce Bank, a federally designated Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and one of the nation’s leading Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Founded in 1960 by Puerto Rican entrepreneurs and community advocates, Ponce Bank was established to serve individuals historically excluded from mainstream financial services. As one of the earliest models of modern urban community banking, the institution has remained locally rooted, culturally connected, and committed to reinvesting in underserved neighborhoods. “Community banking is about relationships,” Ponce Bank President and CEO Carlos Naudon said. “It’s about knowing every customer’s name, their story and their impact. That’s how we make lending decisions. That’s how we build trust. That’s how we create stronger neighborhoods.” Author Oscar Perry Abello (fourth from left) with Ponce Bank President and CEO Carlos Naudon (fifth from left), Executive Vice President and Chief External Affairs Officer Madeline Marquez (seventh from left and other Ponce Bank staff members. Photo courtesy of Ponce Bank Among those featured in Abello’s book is Ponce Bank Senior Vice President and Director of SBA Lending Barbara Arroyo, who was present for the signing. She was featured in the introduction of the book for her deep connections within the Bronx and the work she has dedicated to support local small businesses in the borough through Ponce Bank’s credit committee. Grounded in local knowledge, compassion and long-term commitment, Arroyo’s story is meant to exemplify the most important aspects of community banking. “Every Wednesday, Barbara Arroyo meets with the Bank’s credit committee to tell them about the lives, hopes and dreams of her clients: small business owners in the Bronx, running everything from bodegas to barbershops to catering companies,” Abello wrote in his book. “Barbara works at Ponce Bank — one of just two community banks headquartered in the Bronx… where she was born and raised.” “We are here for the nonprofits, the small businesses and the families who have historically been left out of traditional banking. To see our work reflected in this book — it’s powerful.” Arroyo said, “It meant a lot to be seen — not just as a banker, but as someone who’s grown up in this community and can now give back to it. Our work is personal. It’s about walking alongside people and helping them build something lasting.” Ponce Bank is hopeful that both the event and Abello’s book will resonate with a broad audience, shedding light on the deeper value community banks provide—beyond just financial services. These institutions play a vital role in advancing dignity, expanding access and creating opportunities within the communities they serve. About the Author Author Oscar Perry Abello holds signing for new book on finance and banking at Ponce Bank By Ethan Marshall By Ethan Marshall Posted on April 25, 2025 Posted on Oscar Perry Abello, the author of the new book “ The Banks We Deserve: Reclaiming Community Banking for a Just Economy ,” recently held a book signing, public reading and a discussion on the future of finance and banking across New York State and the United States at the Ponce Bank branch at 2244 Westchester Ave. in the Bronx. Abello’s book urges readers to critically examine who the financial system is truly designed to serve. It invites a reimagining of banking—one that places people, communities, and long-term impact at its core. Through compelling stories from across the country, Abello highlights how community-focused institutions like Ponce Bank are redefining access to capital, promoting economic resilience, and reaching individuals often overlooked by larger banks—all while maintaining financial strength and accountability. Abello’s book urges readers to critically examine who the financial system is truly designed to serve. It invites a reimagining of banking—one that places people, communities, and long-term impact at its core. Through compelling stories from across the country, Abello highlights how community-focused institutions like Ponce Bank are redefining access to capital, promoting economic resilience, and reaching individuals often overlooked by larger banks—all while maintaining financial strength and accountability. The discussion Abello participated in at Ponce Bank centered on the critical role community banks play in addressing the economic and financial needs of residents from all backgrounds—particularly those living in underserved communities. Close Get the Full Story Sign Up Among those in attendance for the public reading, audience Q&A, and book signing were select customers, nonprofit partners, and community members. Many attendees found Abello’s stories relatable, reflecting their own experiences and challenges. By the end of the event, guests walked away with a stronger understanding of how community banks function—and a renewed appreciation for their essential role in fostering economic inclusion and resilience. “Oscar’s work puts words to what we live every day,” Ponce Bank Vice President and Director of Nonprofit Services Wanda Matos said. The message of the book and the accompanying discussion strongly resonated with Ponce Bank, a federally designated Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and one of the nation’s leading Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Founded in 1960 by Puerto Rican entrepreneurs and community advocates, Ponce Bank was established to serve individuals historically excluded from mainstream financial services. As one of the earliest models of modern urban community banking, the institution has remained locally rooted, culturally connected, and committed to reinvesting in underserved neighborhoods. “Community banking is about relationships,” Ponce Bank President and CEO Carlos Naudon said. “It’s about knowing every customer’s name, their story and their impact. That’s how we make lending decisions. That’s how we build trust. That’s how we create stronger neighborhoods.” Author Oscar Perry Abello (fourth from left) with Ponce Bank President and CEO Carlos Naudon (fifth from left), Executive Vice President and Chief External Affairs Officer Madeline Marquez (seventh from left and other Ponce Bank staff members.

She was featured in the introduction of the book for her deep connections within the Bronx and the work she has dedicated to support local small businesses in the borough through Ponce Bank’s credit committee. Grounded in local knowledge, compassion and long-term commitment, Arroyo’s story is meant to exemplify the most important aspects of community banking. “Every Wednesday, Barbara Arroyo meets with the Bank’s credit committee to tell them about the lives, hopes and dreams of her clients: small business owners in the Bronx, running everything from bodegas to barbershops to catering companies,” Abello wrote in his book. “Barbara works at Ponce Bank — one of just two community banks headquartered in the Bronx… where she was born and raised.” “We are here for the nonprofits, the small businesses and the families who have historically been left out of traditional banking. To see our work reflected in this book — it’s powerful.” Arroyo said, “It meant a lot to be seen — not just as a banker, but as someone who’s grown up in this community and can now give back to it. Our work is personal. It’s about walking alongside people and helping them build something lasting.” Ponce Bank is hopeful that both the event and Abello’s book will resonate with a broad audience, shedding light on the deeper value community banks provide—beyond just financial services.

Photo by Milette Millington Candidates running for NYC Mayor highlighted their plans for immigration policy and its proposed effects on these communities on April 16 during the hybrid forum hosted by the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies (CUNY SLU), which was co-sponsored by the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC). The forum was held from 6:30 – 8:30 p.m. The Democratic candidates in attendance were NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, Former NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer, NYS Senator Zellnor Myrie (20th District), Zohran Mamdani, and Michael Blake. NYC Mayor Eric Adams, former NYS Governor Andrew Cuomo, NYS Senator Jessica Ramos (13th District), Whitney Tilson, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, and Independent candidate Jim Walden did not show up. The candidates first discussed how they would evaluate the current state of the city’s sanctuary laws given the Trump administration’s nature and whether they would make any changes to them. Close Stay Connected to the Caribbean Get the latest news and updates delivered to your inbox. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up Former NYS Assembly Member Michael Blake (79th District), who is the son of Jamaican immigrants,  said, “ICE has no business here, whether it be at Rikers, whether our places of worship, whether we have schools. We are a sanctuary city; we will continue to be a sanctuary city. We will make sure that our communities are protected in every possible way. All of us are intertwined at this moment.” Blake added that the changes he’d make to the current sanctuary laws would include increasing legal protections for the 180,000 immigrants who don’t consistently have them and making sure that every time Donald Trump and the federal government come for them, the State is serious in its attacks against the administration. The candidates also discussed the City Council bill Local Law 18 of 2021, which will be reintroduced on April 24 as T2025-3413, which would require delivery workers to have e-bike licenses, and whether they’d support it. NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. Photo by Milette Millington Council Speaker Adams responded, “Our focus again has to be on the livelihood of those who are trying to make a living, and that is where the heart of my work is. I always say I legislate the way that I live. If I can’t represent my neighbor, then I don’t know what my neighbor is going through, suffering through, or dealing with.” She added that her focus as mayor will be on ensuring that immigrants who have come and those who will come to New York have a variety of job opportunities available, despite President Trump’s efforts to make it challenging for those living in the state working hard to make a living. NYC Comptroller Brad Lander. Photo by Milette Millington In addition, the candidates also shared what they would do to protect immigrant workers in New York City from wage theft. Comptroller Lander shared that the Comptroller’s office has been working on this, saying that the office has recovered over $9 million for workers, mostly immigrants, who had their wages stolen. “We created an employer violations dashboard for the first time that tracks city, state, and federal workplace violations. So, you can connect the dots because it’s often the same employer who has done wage theft, that has also had an unfair labor practice, that also violated OSHA guidelines, that also denied their worker paid sick days,” Lander explained. Lander also proposes creating the first-ever Mayor’s Office of Workers Rights. If he becomes mayor, he said he would establish an office that would do precisely this: find the patterns, add enforcement capacity, and connect the dots regarding immigrant worker protection from wage theft. NYS Senator Zellnor Myrie (20th District). Photo by Milette Millington State Senator Myrie also shared his support for fighting against this issue, highlighting that he has supported legislation that would increase the penalties for wage theft. “I think that is something that I would continue to advocate for as the next mayor. We have a Supreme Court in the United States that is hostile to labor rights, that is hostile to the NLRB, and it’s going to be more important than ever that we have a robust Department of Consumer and Worker Protection,” Myrie stated. Myrie strongly believes that New York City will be a leader for the rest of the country in protecting vulnerable workers during the Trump administration. “I think we have to do more Know Your Rights outreach to ensure that people know that the City has their back, and with the law department, I think we have an opportunity to be utilizing every legal tool at our disposal to ensure that we’re protecting ourselves, expanding our Commission on Human Rights, ensuring that people have the protections that they need,” he continued.

[2] 2025 battleground election 2025 battleground election Ballotpedia identified the June 24 primary election as a battleground race . The summary below is from our coverage of this election, Mayoral election in New York, New York, 2025 (June 24 Democratic primary) Eleven candidates are running for the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York on June 24, 2025. Seven have led in polling and fundraising: Adrienne Adams (D), Andrew Cuomo (D), Brad Lander (D), Zohran Mamdani (D), Zellnor Myrie (D), Jessica Ramos (D), and Scott Stringer (D). Incumbent Eric Adams (D) withdrew from the primaries on April 3 to run as an independent. [3] The New York Times ' Emma G. Fitzsimmons wrote the race "is unusually volatile and will have major consequences for the nation’s largest city." [4] Before Eric Adams' withdrawal, an Emerson College poll taken between March 21-24 of 653 likely voters and a margin of ± 3.8% showed Cuomo in the lead with 38%, Mamdani with 10%, Adams with 8%, with other leading candidates polling at 4-6% support. [5] New York Daily News ' Chris Sommerfeldt wrote the poll's findings "come even as [Cuomo and Mamdani are] positioning themselves on the diametrically opposite ends of the Democratic Party spectrum." [6] Additionally, in the same Emerson College poll, voters were asked which issues should be the next mayor's main focus. Thirty-three percent of voters said public safety and crime should be the main focus, while 23% said housing, 10% immigration, 7% healthcare, 6% homelessness, 5% jobs, and 4% education.

We must guarantee a pipeline to success by providing our children a consistent quality of education from preschool through college. This means ensuring our students aren’t packed into overcrowded classrooms and placed in situations where two or more schools are forced to co-exist in one building. Economic Development Labor & Careers: Growth should be affordable to all community residents regardless of income level. Long-standing residents and small businesses should never 
be priced out of thriving in developing neighborhoods. The fear of increased property values and displacement must never be realized for the families of Southeast Queens. For many families, one of the most pressing concerns is stability. Parents want to ensure that their children and loved ones have a stable home with proper means to support their families. One of the most effective ways for families to achieve stability is through solid careers with opportunity for growth and benefits, including affordable health-care, dental coverage and retirement plans. I intend to work with labor union representation to continue to guarantee and protect careers, wages and benefits. Minority & Women Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) The numbers of women in management and decision-making places in Corporate America do not reflect our numbers in tenacity of employment, paying the bills and keeping food on the table for our families. In this day and time, women are still at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to gaining our fair share of business equity. I will partner with colleagues in Albany to ensure that new legislation supports pay equality for women. Affordable Housing I will fight to ensure that Southeast Queens gets its fair share of state funding and state-financed incentives to create new affordable housing units in our district. State government must ensure that developers building new housing and commercial properties provide rental and home ownership opportunities for working families. The issue of affordable housing extends to the senior population. As our neighborhoods are being developed, less affordable housing exists for seniors. A majority of their lives have been spent working with a hope of retirement and the an ability to afford housing on fixed incomes. I will work to ensure that housing development in District 10 includes access to exceptional affordable homes.

State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 State legislative elections, 2025 2026 » « 2024 » «  2025 elections Choose a state below: New Jersey House Virginia House Submit Two of the country's 99 state legislative chambers are holding regularly-scheduled elections in 2025. Elections in those two chambers represent 180 of the country's 7,386 state legislative seats (2.4%). General elections in New Jersey and Virginia will take place on November 4, 2025 . Off-year elections in Virginia are often studied as a forecast of the broader political trends to expect from the following year's national elections. [1] The New York Times' Neil Vigdor wrote in December 2024, "In recent elections, Virginia has become a vessel for millions of dollars in spending by outside groups, and its open governor’s seat and divided legislature appears likely to continue that trend." [2] States are also holding special state legislative elections in 2025 to fill vacant seats. Click here for more .

Targeted chambers Targeted chambers DLCC targets DLCC targets The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced they would target the Virginia House in the 2025 elections : [3] “ In 2023, the DLCC helped win full legislative control in Virginia by defending the Democratic majority in the state Senate and flipping the House of Delegates blue. This year, the stakes are high as we gear up for the first major electoral test of the Trump 2.0 era. Every seat in the state House is up for reelection and Virginia voters have an opportunity to elect a Democratic trifecta. [4] [5] ” RSLC targets RSLC targets As of April 2025, Ballotpedia did not identify any statements from RSLC about targeted chambers in 2025. To notify us of a resource to add, email us . Satellite spending Satellite spending Satellite spending describes political spending not controlled by candidates or their campaigns; that is, any political expenditures made by groups or individuals that are not directly affiliated with a candidate. This includes spending by political party committees, super PACs , trade associations, and 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups . [6] [7] [8] If available, this section includes links to online resources tracking satellite spending in this election. To notify us of a resource to add, email us . On Feb. 18, 2025, the Republican State Leadership Committee announced a six-figure Virginia ad campaign, stating: “ The RSLC PAC, in coordination with the Virginia House Republican Campaign Committee (HRCC), today launched a new digital ad exposing how Virginia House Democrats are breaking their promises to voters by pursuing an out-of-touch agenda in Richmond this legislative session. The ad will be backed by a six-figure buy on digital platforms throughout the state and highlights how Virginia House Democrats are blocking tax cuts and efforts to lower electric costs, as well as refusing to crack down on dangerous illegal immigrants. [9] [5] ” On April 7, 2025, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced a seven-figure Virginia ad campaign. DLCC Director Heather Williams said: “ Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025. [10] [5] ” Historical competitiveness data Historical competitiveness data Ballotpedia began examining the competitiveness of every state legislative race in the country in 2010. Three factors are used in this analysis: seats where the incumbent did not run for re-election, incumbents who ran in contested primaries, and seats contested by both major parties. The following table details competitiveness data collected from regularly scheduled state legislative elections between 2010 and 2023. Odd-year elections are shown grouped together first followed by even-year elections.

Election dates Election dates The following table details 2025 state legislative filing deadlines and primary dates in each state. The signature filing deadline was the date by which candidates had to file nominating signatures with election officials in order to have their names placed on the ballot. New Jersey March 24 June 10 Virginia April 3 June 17 Trifectas Trifectas State government trifecta is a term to describe single-party government, when one political party holds the governorship and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. As of April 25, 2025, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 15 Democratic trifectas,  and 12 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control. Political context Political context The 2025 cycle is the first election cycle after the 2024 presidential election . Both chambers in New Jersey and the Virginia House held elections in 2023 . Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2024 From 2010 to 2024, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 14 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and two—the Minnesota House of Representatives and New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2024 elections, Democrats controlled 39 chambers and Republicans controlled 57. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House, and the Minnesota House was tied. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election. An example of this is the brief period of Democratic control in the Virginia State Senate in 2014. [11] For this chart, a red box indicates that the chamber changed from Democratic to Republican control, and a blue box indicates that the chamber changed from Republican to Democratic control.

The chart below shows the number of state legislative chambers where at least one legislative seat changed party control in each election from 1992 to 2024.  Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 Trifectas from 2010 to 2024 A state government trifecta occurs when one political party controls the primary levers of power in a state: the governor's office, the state Senate, and the state House. From 2010 to 2018, the Republican Party increased its number of trifectas and the Democratic Party saw a decline in its trifectas. Democrats picked up six trifectas in the 2018 elections, and Republicans lost four trifectas. Following the 2021 elections, the Democratic trifecta in Virginia became a split government after Republicans gained control of the state House and governorship . After the 2023 elections, the divided government in Louisiana became a Republican trifecta when Jeff Landry (R) won election as governor. After the 2024 elections, Republicans maintained their trifectas, and two Democratic trifectas became divided governments. This chart shows the number of trifectas each party held heading into elections from 2010 to 2024, and the number of trifectas following the 2024 elections.

This tradition is rooted in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution, which states that the president "may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices." [1] The vice president and several other administrators, directors, and representatives are also part of the Cabinet. Click here for an overview of Trump's Cabinet members. The following individuals are members of Trump's Cabinet. They have either been confirmed by the U.S. Senate or hold a position that does not require Senate confirmation.   Nominees awaiting confirmation Nominees awaiting confirmation TBD , Ambassador to the United Nations  Key legislation Key legislation This section provides overviews of key federal legislation considered during the second Trump administration . To be included, the bill must have met several of the following qualifying factors: Collaboration between the president and congressional leadership on the bill Use of the reconciliation process to pass the bill Changes to the congressional procedure to pass the bill Estimated cost of the bill as evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office Extent of public relations campaign to promote the bill Domestic and international policy ramifications Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process Budget resolutions proposed during the 2025 U.S. Congress reconciliation process This page provides information about budget resolutions proposed and adopted during the 119th Congress . Budget resolutions are resolutions that broadly outline spending priorities for a reconciliation bill . The Senate and the House adopting identical budget resolutions is the first step in the reconciliation process. [2] Budget reconciliation is a legislative process that can be used to override the filibuster and expedite the approval of a package of legislation in Congress that changes spending, revenues, or the debt limit. The House voted 217-215 on February 25, 2025, to adopt the initial version of the budget resolution (H.Con.Res.14) that included border, defense, and energy spending, along with tax reductions to replace the expiring tax policy from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018 . [3] There were 217 Republicans who voted in favor of the resolution, while Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and 214 Democrats voted against the resolution. [4] The Senate voted 51-48 to adopt an amended version of H.Con.Res.14 on April 5, 2025. The amended version also included a debt ceiling increase. [5] On April 10, the House voted to adopt the Senate-amended version of HCon.Res.14, completing the budget resolution process. The House voted 216-214 in favor of the resolution, with Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joining 212 Democrats in voting against the resolution. The Senate had previously voted 52-48 to approve a version of the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution (S.Con.Res.7) focused primarily on border, defense, and energy spending in February. [6] Trump's executive orders and actions  Trump's executive orders and actions As of April 24, 2025, President Donald Trump (R) had signed 139 executive orders , 37 memoranda , and 39 proclamations in his second presidential term , which began on January 20, 2025. Each type of presidential document is different in authority and implementation. Executive orders are directives the president writes to officials within the executive branch requiring them to take or stop some action related to policy or management. They are numbered, published in the Federal Register , cite the authority by which the president is making the order, and the Office of Management and Budget issues budgetary impact analyses for each order. [7] [8] Presidential memoranda and notices also include instructions directed at executive officials, but they are neither numbered nor have the same publication requirements. The Office of Management and Budget is also not required to issue a budgetary impact statement on the subject of the memoranda or notices. [9] [10] In his 2014 book, By Order of the President: The Use and Abuse of Executive Direct Action , Phillip J. Cooper, a professor of public administration at Portland State University, wrote, "As a practical matter, the memorandum is now being used as the equivalent of an executive order, but without meeting the legal requirements for an executive order." [11] Proclamations are a third type of executive directive that typically relate to private individuals or ceremonial events, such as holidays and commemorations. [9] [12] Trump has issued 139 executive orders so far during his year in office, which is the highest first-year executive order total since Harry Truman (D), who also issued 139 executive orders in 1945. Looking at his second term executive orders by topic , Trump has issued the most executive orders on foreign policy (35). Across his first and second terms, Trump has issued a total of 359 executive orders. This is the 12th-most executive orders issued by any president in U.S. history.  Click here for a complete list of Trump's executive actions. Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Federal judges nominated by Donald Trump Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump (R) has not nominated any individuals to federal judgeships on Article III courts. During his first term in office, President Donald Trump (R) nominated 274 individuals to federal judgeships. Trump made 245 judicial appointments. [13] Of those appointments, 234 were Article III judges. [14] Trump withdrew eight nominees and 143 received no vote from the Senate . [15] Ballotpedia publishes the federal vacancy count report tracking vacancies, nominations, and confirmations to all United States Article III federal courts each month. In the most recent report covering activity in March 2025 , there were 43 Article III vacancies in the federal judiciary. To learn more about current vacancies in the federal judiciary, click here . The sections below group Trump's Article III judicial nominees by which step of the process they are on: confirmed by the U.S. Senate, awaiting a vote by the full Senate, awaiting a vote in committee, and awaiting a hearing before the committee. Click the arrows at the top of each table to sort by name, court, or the date of an individual's formal nomination. For a list of non-Article III nominees, click here . Confirmed to their positions Confirmed to their positions No nominees have been confirmed in the Senate. Waiting for vote in Senate Waiting for vote in Senate No nominees are awaiting a vote in the Senate. Waiting for committee vote Waiting for committee vote No nominees are awaiting a vote in committee. Waiting for committee hearing Waiting for committee hearing Note: Individuals without a date in the "first nomination" column have been announced as nominees by Trump but not yet formally nominated. No nominees are awaiting a hearing in committee. Presidential and congressional approval ratings Presidential and congressional approval ratings Multistate lawsuits against the federal government Multistate lawsuits against the federal government Multistate lawsuits are legal actions involving two or more state attorneys general. As of March 23, 2025, 11 multistate lawsuits had been filed against the second Trump administration.

Vetoed legislation Vetoed legislation This section will provide an overview of vetoed legislation during Trump's second presidential term. Tie-breaking votes cast by J.D. Vance in the U.S. Senate Tie-breaking votes cast by J.D. Vance in the U.S. Senate Vice President J.D. Vance (R) has cast one tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate . Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution , the vice president of the United States also serves as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, he or she may cast the deciding vote when there is a tie in the Senate. John Adams cast the first tie-breaking vote on July 18, 1789. As of January 24, 2025, there were 302 tie-breaking votes from 38 vice presidents. Kamala Harris (D) (2021-2025) cast the most tie-breaking votes (33) during her tenure as vice president, John C. Calhoun (1825 - 1832) cast the second most (31), and Adams (1789 - 1797) cast the third most (29). Twelve vice presidents, including Joe Biden and Dan Quayle , never cast a tie-breaking vote during their time in office.

[2] The act would have introduced new regulation surrounding driftnet fishing, a method of fishing involving the use of a large net that drifts on ocean currents to catch fish. The act would have expanded an existing ban on gillnets longer than 2.5 kilometers to also prohibit the use of any nets with a mesh size exceeding 14 inches. It would also have required the U.S. Department of Commerce to carry out a program assisting in a transition away from driftnet fishing during the five years before it was set to take effect. [2] In his veto message , President Trump said that the bill would put fishermen out of business and was a solution to a problem that did not exist because existing fishing management programs worked to prevent overfishing without prohibiting the use of driftnets. President Trump added that the bill would increase demand for foreign seafood that is produced in countries with fewer regulations in place to prevent overfishing. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) introduced S.906 on March 27, 2019. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) signed on as cosponsors on June 18, 2019. It passed the Senate by voice vote on July 22, 2020, and passed the House 283-105 on Dec. 10, 2020. The 283 yeas included 226 Democrats, 56 Republicans, and one independent. All 105 nay votes were Republicans. Thirty-five Republicans and six Democrats did not vote. H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 On Dec. 23, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.R.6395 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 . [3] On December 29, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 322-87 to override Trump's veto. [12] The National Defense Authorization Act (N.D.A.A.) authorizes appropriations and sets policies for the Department of Defense on an annual basis. H.R.6395 applied to FY2021 which began on Oct. 1, 2020, and ended on Sept. 30, 2021. The N.D.A.A. does not set overall spending levels, but rather authorizes appropriations established in separate pieces of legislation. [3] In his veto message, Trump identified four provisions included in H.R.6395, with which he disagreed: [13] Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act : the Communications Decency Act was passed in 1996. Section 230 of that law guarantees websites and Internet providers protection from lawsuits over content posted or shared on those platforms by users. Trump supported the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which H.R.6395 did not contain. Trump wrote, "Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity." [13] Renamining certain military installations : H.R.6395 included a process to rename military installations named after Confederate soldiers through a National Commission on Modernizing Military Installation Designations staffed by members of Congress and military service secretaries. [3] Trump wrote, "I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles." [13] Limits on emergency military construction fund usage : H.R.6395 set a limit on how much the Defense Department could re-allocate within its budget for emergency military construction directed by the president.  In his veto message, Trump wrote, "In a time when adversaries have the means to directly attack the homeland, the President must be able to safeguard the American people without having to wait for congressional authorization." [13] Limits on troop withdrawals : H.R.6395 set limits on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea. In Afghanistan and Germany, the resolution dictated that the planned withdrawals of 2,000 and 12,000 troops from each country, respectively, be halted pending review from the Defense and State Departments. [14] In South Korea, the resolution prohibited the usage of funds to decrease troop levels in the country below 28,500. [15] Trump wrote, "Article II of the Constitution makes the President the Commander in Chief ... [T]he decision regarding how many troops to deploy and where, including in Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea, rests with him. The Congress may not arrogate this authority to itself or indirectly as purported spending restrictions." [13] Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) introduced H.R.6395 introduced the resolution on March 26, 2020. On Dec. 8, the House voted 335-78 to pass the resolution with 195 Democrats and 140 Republicans voting yea and 37 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and one Libertarian voting nay. The Senate voted 84-13 to pass the resolution on Dec. 11 with 41 Democrats, 42 Republicans, and one Independent voting yea and five Democrats, seven Republicans, and one Independent voting nay. [3] Both chambers passed H.R.6395 with more than the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability".  H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". On May 29, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to "Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability". [4] The resolution was introduced to block a 2019 U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) rule related to government forgiveness of certain student loan debt. The rule changed the process students must follow to discharge their loans and empowered the D.O.E. to collect money from schools to cover financial losses following successful student challenges. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos argued in a December 2019 press release that the new rule “ensures that taxpayers who did not go to college or who faithfully paid off their student loans do not shoulder student loan costs for those who didn’t suffer harm.” [16] Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nevada) introduced the resolution on September 26, 2019. On January 16, 2020, 225 Democrats and six Republicans voted to pass the resolution in the U.S. House while 179 Republicans and Justin Amash (L-Mich.) voted nay. A version of the resolution passed the U.S. Senate on March 11 with 42 Democrats, 10 Republicans, and Angus King (I-Maine) voting to pass the resolution while 42 Republicans voted nay. In his veto message, Trump said, “Whereas the last administration promoted a regulatory environment that produced precipitous school closures and stranded students, this new rule puts the needs of students first, extends the window during which they can qualify for loan discharge, and encourages schools to provide students with opportunities to complete their educations and continue their pursuit of economic success.” [17] S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. On May 6, 2020, President Donald Trump (R) vetoed S.J.Res.68 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. [5] The resolution was introduced in response to a January 3 airstrike ordered by the president that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Qods Force, a unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [18] [19] The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on January 9, 2020. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 55-45 vote on February 13, 2020, and the U.S. House by a 227-186 vote on March 11, 2020. The resolution prohibited the president from engaging in the use of force against Iran without prior congressional approval either in the form of a declaration of war or a specific authorization. [5] The resolution allowed the president to use military force against Iran without congressional approval only if it was in order to defend the U.S. against an imminent attack. [5] In his veto message, President Trump argued that the resolution "incorrectly implies that the military airstrike against Qassem Soleimani in Iraq was conducted without statutory authority," saying it was authorized under the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. [18] The President also said the resolution threatened to hinder the ability of the U.S. to defend itself and its allies against hostilities from Iran or other forces backed by the country.

The resolution prohibited an export license providing technical data allowing for the manufacture of the Aurora fuzing system used in the Paveway IV laser-guided bomb to Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [7] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution could "produce unintended consequences for defense procurement and interoperability with and between our partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen and endanger the lives of U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia. [20] S.J.Res.37 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of France of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution prohibited an export license related to the Paveway II laser-guided bomb to France, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. [8] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened "weaken America’s global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners." The President also said that it threatened to prolong the war in Yemen by weakening the capabilities of the United Arab Emirates, placing U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia at risk. [21] S.J.Res.54 - A joint resolution relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019.

The resolution was similar to H.J.Res.46 , which Trump vetoed on March 15, 2019. The resolution was introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on September 10, 2019. It passed the U.S. Senate by a 54-41 vote on September 25, 2019, and the U.S. House by a 236-174 on September 27, 2019. The resolution terminated the national emergency declaration made by Trump on February 15, 2019, which directed $8.1 billion towards building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In his veto message, Trump said that the emergency declaration, "empowered my Administration’s Government-wide strategy to counter large-scale unlawful migration and to respond to corresponding humanitarian challenges ... [and] facilitated the military’s ongoing construction of virtually insurmountable physical barriers along hundreds of miles of our southern border." [22] He said, "The southern border ... continues to be a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics to come into our country," adding, "S.J. Res. 54 would undermine the Government’s ability to address this continuing national emergency." [22] S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services.  S.J.Res.36 - A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense articles and services.

The resolution prohibited export and manufacturing licenses related to the Paveway II and Paveway IV laser-guided bombs to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom which had been proposed on June 3, 2019. In particular, the resolution identified a manufacturing agreement under which Paveway components would be produced in Saudi Arabia. [9] In his veto message, President Trump said that the resolution threatened to limit U.S. security capabilities, endanger U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia, prolong the war in Yemen, and "damage the credibility of the United States as a reliable partner by signaling that we are willing to abandon our partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing."

What is a presidential veto? Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States gives the president of the United States the ability to veto a bill passed by Congress. The president can issue a regular veto or a pocket veto. Regular veto : "The regular veto is a qualified negative veto. The President returns the unsigned legislation to the originating house of Congress within a 10 day period usually with a memorandum of disapproval or a 'veto message.' Congress can override the President’s decision if it musters the necessary two–thirds vote of each house." [28] Pocket veto : "The pocket veto is an absolute veto that cannot be overridden. The veto becomes effective when the President fails to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned and is unable to override the veto. The authority of the pocket veto is derived from the Constitution’s Article I, section 7, 'the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case, it shall not be law.'" [28] Article I, Section 7  Article I, Section 7 According to Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States, “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill. [29] [30] Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.

Thirty-three states sent the same members of Congress that represented them at the end of the 118th Congress. The congressional delegations of four states became more Democratic. The party gained one member each in Alabama, Louisiana, and Oregon. The party also gained three members each in California and New York. The congressional delegations of eight states became more Republican. The party gained one member in Alaska, Colorado, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. The party also gained three members each in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

These two appointees cannot have been enrolled in the top two major political parties in the state. The legislature must approve the commission's plans by a simple up/down vote. The legislature must reject two separate sets of redistricting plans before it will be able to amend the commission's proposals. All districts will be required "to preserve minority rights, be equally populated, and consist of compact and contiguous territory." Further, state law will require that districts "not be drawn to discourage competition or to favor/disfavor candidates or parties." In prior redistricting cycles, authority for both congressional and state legislative redistricting was vested with the state legislature. An advisory commission participated in the process. [17] State law requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and compact. State legislative districts must also take into account the "historic and traditional significance of counties." [17] 2020 2020 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State legislative maps enacted in 2022-2023 State Assembly districts New York enacted new state Assembly district boundaries on April 24, 2023, when Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed legislation establishing them for use starting with the 2024 elections. [18] The bill adopting the districts passed earlier that day in the state Assembly by a vote of 132-13, and it passed the state Senate by a vote of 59-1. [19] [20] The legislation stated, "Vacancies in the Assembly will be filled using existing boundaries until January 1, 2025, at which time vacancies will be filled using the new boundaries." [21] The state redrew its Assembly district boundaries in response to a June 10, 2022, decision by the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court in Nichols v. Hochul . [22] That court upheld a lower court ruling that declared the state's Assembly district boundaries invalid but determined that they should still be used for the 2022 legislative elections since the lawsuit challenging them was filed too close to those elections for the courts to intervene. [23] The appellate division ruling determined that the Assembly district map was enacted in violation of the state's constitutional redistricting process and ordered a New York City-based state trial court to oversee the redrawing of boundaries for the 2024 elections. [23] On September 29, 2022, that trial court directed the IRC to "initiate the constitutional process for amending the assembly district map based on the 2020 census data by formulating a proposed assembly map" and submit such a plan to the legislature by April 28, 2023. [24] The New York State Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) had voted 9-1 on April 20, 2023, to advance this plan and submit it to the legislature with the Commission stating in its cover letter that the plan "garnered the highest number of votes in support" at its meeting on that date. [25] [26] According to Giulia Heyward and Jon Campbell at Gothamist , the new districts replaced "a nearly identical set of districts that were just put into place for last year’s races before a court threw them out." [27] Heyward and Campbell also wrote that "The commission had originally put forward a draft that would have made considerable changes before settling on a revised proposal last week mirroring the lines already in place." [27] Click here to view more information about Assembly districts enacted in 2023, including zoomable maps and links to detailed demographic statistics for each district.' State Senate districts On May 20, 2022, Justice Patrick McAllister ordered the adoption of a new state senate map drawn by redistricting special master Jonathan Cervas which took effect for New York's 2022 legislative elections. [28] On April 27, the New York Court of Appeals , the state's highest court, overturned a decision by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court which overturned a lower court's ruling invalidating the legislature's state Senate boundaries. [29] [30] [31] [22] Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) had signed new state legislative district boundaries into law on February 3, 2022. The New York State Senate voted 43-20 to approve them, and the New York State Assembly approved them 120-27 on the same day. [32] [33] Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps Reactions to 2023 state Assembly maps New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie supported the new districts, saying, "I think the [commission] listened to the testimony that was given to them throughout all of the hearings across the state, and I think they came back with a fair map." [34] Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of Citizens Union, criticized the new boundaries as too similar to the ones already in place: "The new Assembly districts approved by the Independent Redistricting Commission are strikingly similar to the districts drawn by the legislature last year...This similarity suggests that the Commission drew the Assembly maps to please lawmakers." [35] Citizens Union describes itself on its website as a group "committed to reforming New York City and State government by fostering transparency, accountability, accessibility, honesty and the highest ethical standards." [36] Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Reactions to 2022 state Senate maps Following the passage of the map, Hochul said: "These bills are necessary to reapportion districts and to provide certainty and clarity regarding such districts in a timely manner, allowing for efficient administration of the electoral process." State Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy said: "There is a wild, partisan gerrymandering that took place here. It violates the state Constitution, and we’re going to try to get justice."

The state's growth rate was at 2.19%, which was below the national rate of 9.7%. [38] Redistricting became an issue in the state prior to the November 2010 elections. Going into the elections, the organization NY Uprising asked all candidates to sign a pledge to support nonpartisan redistricting during the following legislative session. A majority of those who won in both chambers signed the pledge. [39] Additionally, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) stated his pledge to veto any new maps that were not drawn through a nonpartisan process. [40] Following a number of delays, the Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment (LATFOR) released proposed Senate and Assembly maps on January 26, 2012. The Senate plan included an additional 63rd seat. Gov. Cuomo threatened to veto the maps. [41] On March 11, LATFOR filed a bill of their final plans, which closely resembled the maps they released two months earlier. Along with this, leaders offered a constitutional amendment that would set up a new bipartisan commission on redistricting following the next census in 2020. [42] Following a walkout of Senate Democrats, the bill passed. Later that week the constitutional amendment passed. [43] With that approved, Cuomo said, "It’s over once and for all" [44] and signed the maps into law. [45] Legislators Legislators Salaries Salaries $142,000/year The exact amount members receive for per diem is unknown. When sworn in When sworn in New York legislators assume office the first day of January after a general election. [47] History History Partisan balance 1992-2013 Partisan balance 1992-2013 New York State Senate: From 1992-2013, the Democratic Party was the majority in the New York State Senate for two years while the Republicans were the majority for 20 years. The New York State Senate is one of 13 state senates that was Republican for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. Across the country, there were 541 Democratic and 517 Republican state senates from 1992 to 2013. New York State House of Representatives: During every year from 1992-2013, the Democratic Party was the majority in the New York State House of Representatives. The New York State House of Representatives is one of 18 state Houses that was Democratic for more than 80 percent of the years between 1992-2013. Across the country, there were 577 Democratic and 483 Republican State Houses of Representatives from 1992 to 2013. Over the course of the 22-year study, state governments became increasingly more partisan. At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states, the most in the 22 years studied. The chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of New York , the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly from 1992 to 2013. SQLI and partisanship SQLI and partisanship The chart below depicts the partisanship of the New York state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. New York experienced a Democratic trifecta from 2009-2010. During half the years of the study, New York was ranked in the bottom-10. Its lowest ranking, finishing 43rd, occurred from 2005-2006, during a divided government. Its best ranking also occurred during a divided government, finishing 32nd in 2011.  Constitutional amendments Constitutional amendments In every state but Delaware, voter approval is required to enact a constitutional amendment. In each state, the legislature has a process for referring constitutional amendments before voters. In 18 states, initiated constitutional amendments can be put on the ballot through a signature petition drive. There are also many other types of statewide measures . The methods in which the New York Constitution can be amended:  I • II • III • IV • V • VI • VII • VIII • IX • X • XI • XII • XIII • XIV • XV • XVI • XVII • XVIII • XIX • XX The New York Constitution can be amended through legislatively referred constitutional amendments or through constitutional conventions . Legislature Legislature A simple majority vote is required during two successive legislative sessions for the New York State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot. That amounts to a minimum of 126 votes in the New York State Assembly and 32 votes in the New York State Senate , assuming no vacancies. Amendments do not require the governor's signature to be referred to the ballot. Convention Convention According to Section 2 of Article XIX of the New York Constitution , a question about whether to hold a state constitutional convention is to automatically appear on the state's ballot every 20 years starting in 1957. New York is one of 14 states that provides for an automatic constitutional convention question.

Battlegrounds are elections that Ballotpedia expects to have a meaningful effect on the balance of power in governments or to be particularly competitive or compelling. These races receive additional coverage and emphasis on Ballotpedia. This page explains how we define battlegrounds and lists those we have identified since 2017 . Factors for determining the competitiveness of a race include the following: Electoral history of the jurisdiction (be it a school district, city, congressional district, or state) Whether it is an open-seat race (if the incumbent is not seeking re-election) If a notable challenger enters a race Race ratings (for U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial elections) Polling results Many factors in addition to and beyond competitiveness may make a race particularly compelling or meaningful to the balance of power in governments. These include the following: For primary elections, whether the race features significant intra-party conflict Whether the result may have an effect on redistricting Whether the result stands to influence trifecta or triplex status for state-level races (state executives and state legislatures) If the election occurs alongside a noteworthy event , such as changes to district lines or campaign finance laws Whether the race stands to influence which faction or party controls a city council, school board, mayorship, state executive office, state legislature, chamber of Congress, or other governing body/office If the race has attracted significant levels of satellite spending or endorsements from influencers Contents  1 How we choose battleground elections 1 How we choose battleground elections 2 Battleground elections covered by Ballotpedia 2.1 2025 2.1.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.1.2 State battlegrounds 2.1.3 Local battlegrounds 2.2 2024 2.2.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.2.2 State battlegrounds 2.2.3 Local battlegrounds 2.3 2023 2.3.1 State battlegrounds 2.3.2 Local battlegrounds 2.3.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.4 2022 2.5 2021 2.5.1 State battlegrounds 2.5.2 Local battlegrounds 2.5.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.6 2020 2.7 2019 2.7.1 State battlegrounds 2.7.2 Local battlegrounds 2.7.3 Federal special election battlegrounds 2.8 2018 2.9 2017 2 Battleground elections covered by Ballotpedia 2.1 2025 2.1.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.1.2 State battlegrounds 2.1.3 Local battlegrounds 2.1 2025 2.1.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.1.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.1.2 State battlegrounds 2.1.2 State battlegrounds 2.1.3 Local battlegrounds 2.1.3 Local battlegrounds 2.2 2024 2.2.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.2.2 State battlegrounds 2.2.3 Local battlegrounds 2.2 2024 2.2.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.2.1 Federal battlegrounds 2.2.2 State battlegrounds 2.2.2 State battlegrounds 2.2.3 Local battlegrounds 2.2.3 Local battlegrounds 2.3 2023 2.3.1 State battlegrounds 2.3.2 Local battlegrounds 2.3.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.3 2023 2.3.1 State battlegrounds 2.3.1 State battlegrounds 2.3.2 Local battlegrounds 2.3.2 Local battlegrounds 2.3.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.3.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.4 2022 2.4 2022 2.5 2021 2.5.1 State battlegrounds 2.5.2 Local battlegrounds 2.5.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.5 2021 2.5.1 State battlegrounds 2.5.1 State battlegrounds 2.5.2 Local battlegrounds 2.5.2 Local battlegrounds 2.5.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.5.3 Federal battlegrounds 2.6 2020 2.6 2020 2.7 2019 2.7.1 State battlegrounds 2.7.2 Local battlegrounds 2.7.3 Federal special election battlegrounds 2.7 2019 2.7.1 State battlegrounds 2.7.1 State battlegrounds 2.7.2 Local battlegrounds 2.7.2 Local battlegrounds 2.7.3 Federal special election battlegrounds 2.7.3 Federal special election battlegrounds 2.8 2018 2.8 2018 2.9 2017 2.9 2017 3 See also 3 See also How we choose battleground elections How we choose battleground elections Ballotpedia conducts regular reviews of federal and state elections to look for primaries and general elections that meet our criteria as battlegrounds. A review of federal and state executive elections is conducted after each state's filing deadline passes. Our staff also conduct weekly reviews of races nominated for battleground coverage by readers and staffers. Finally, Ballotpedia conducts a regular review of its list of battlegrounds to consider whether any races no longer meet our criteria. Due to the number of individual state legislative races ongoing in any given year, Ballotpedia takes a different approach when identifying state legislative battlegrounds. Rather than identifying individual battleground races, Ballotpedia identifies state legislative chambers that meet our overall battleground criteria, then designates individual races ongoing in those chambers as battleground districts . For primaries, we look for intraparty conflict which follows a common theme across the chamber, whether it might be disagreements over leadership roles, power-sharing agreements, or ongoing disputes on policy within a caucus. For general elections, we look for chambers that have the potential to change partisan control and for those where the majority party has a chance to gain or lose a supermajority .

Fifty-nine of the races were in state house chambers, and five were in a state senate chamber. Click here to see a list of all the races. Of the 85 state legislative chambers that held elections in 2024, 21 (24.7%) had at least one race that was decided by fewer than 100 votes. The New Hampshire House of Representatives had 22 races decided by fewer than 100 votes—more than any other chamber. As of 2020 , there were, on average, 3,444 people in each New Hampshire House district, making them the smallest state legislative districts in the country. The Maine House of Representatives and Vermont House of Representatives each had nine races decided by fewer than 100 votes—the second-highest number after the New Hampshire House. The Maine House was also the only chamber where the number of races decided by fewer than 100 votes exceeded the total number of seats separating Democrats and Republicans following the election. In 2022 , there were two such chambers—the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Houses. In Maine, nine races were decided by fewer than 100 votes, and Democrats had a 76-73-2 majority after the election. This means that the Maine House was as close as 21 total votes away from a Republican majority. Had the two closest races won by Democrats— District 75 (decided by seven votes) and District 52 (decided by 14 votes)—been won by Republicans instead, the result would have been a 75-74-2 Republican majority. Across all 64 races, Democrats won 36 (56.3%), Republicans won 27 (42.2%), and one winner (1.6%) was unenrolled. In 2022, Democrats won 49 races by fewer than 100 votes (47.6%), Republicans won 52 (50.5%), Independents won one (1%), and one was tied. Most of the races took place in districts with small population sizes compared to the rest of the country. Forty-eight (75%) were in districts with a population of less than 25,000. Districts that size made up 26.3% of all state legislative districts as of 2020. In 2022 , there were 103 (1.64%) of the 6,278 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes. In 2020 , there were 30 (0.5%) of the 5,875 state legislative races decided by fewer than 100 votes.

Democrats lost supermajority status in New York and Vermont and gained it in Connecticut , while Republicans lost supermajority status in Montana and North Carolina and gained it in Iowa and South Carolina . Forty-four states held elections for at least one state legislative chamber. In total, there were veto-proof majorities in 29 state legislatures before the election—nine Democratic and 20 Republican. After the election, there were veto-proof majorities in 28 state legislatures —eight Democratic and 20 Republican. State governors may veto bills advanced by the state legislature. With sufficient support—between one-half and two-thirds of sitting legislators, depending on the state—state legislatures may overturn a gubernatorial veto. When one party controls enough seats to overturn a veto without any support from the other party, a legislature can be said to hold a veto-proof majority . These are most important when the governor belongs to the opposite party as the veto-proof legislature. Heading into the 2024 elections, four states had a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party: Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. After the elections, Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, North Carolina and Vermont lost that status, and no new state became a veto-proof legislature with an opposing party governor. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections, but neither state's legislative majority reached its supermajority threshold.

After the elections, seven had Democratic supermajorities, 18 had Republican supermajorities, and 19 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of those states before and after the elections.  Democratic 8 -1 7 Republican 18 0 18 No veto-proof majority 18 +1 19  Across all 50 state legislatures, there were nine Democratic supermajorities, 20 Republican supermajorities, and 21 states without a supermajority before the elections. After the elections, eight state legislatures had Democratic supermajorities, 20 had Republican supermajorities, and 22 did not have a supermajority. The table below shows the veto-proof majority statuses of all 50 states before and after the elections. Democratic 9 -1 8 Republican 20 0 20 No veto-proof majority 21 +1 22  The map below shows the veto-proof majority status across all 50 states after the 2024 elections.  Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Veto-proof majorities are most important when the other party controls the governorship. This creates more opportunities for legislatures to override gubernatorial vetoes. Heading into 2024, the 29 state legislatures where one party had a veto-proof majority in both chambers included four states where the governor was a member of a different political party than the veto-proof majority : Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont. Kansas and Kentucky maintained that status, while North Carolina and Vermont lost it. Two states— Nevada and Wisconsin —had the potential to have veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Neither state acquired that status following the elections . The table below shows the status of the four states that had veto-proof majorities and opposing party governors and the two states that had the potential to acquire that status before and after the 2024 elections. Kansas Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes Kentucky Supermajority Democratic Yes Supermajority Democratic Yes North Carolina Supermajority Democratic Yes No supermajority Democratic No Vermont Supermajority Republican Yes No supermajority Republican No Nevada No supermajority Republican No No supermajority Republican No Wisconsin No supermajority Democratic No No supermajority Democratic No States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors States with veto-proof majorities and opposing-party governors Kansas and Kentucky both maintained their veto-proof status and remained Republican supermajorities with Democratic governors as a result of the 2024 elections. Vermont lost its veto-proof majority status. Before the election, Democrats in Vermont held one more than the 20 Senate seats required and seven more than the 100 House seats required for supermajority control. As of Nov. 18, Democrats won 16 Senate seats and 78 House seats, with five races uncalled. [1] North Carolina Republicans also lost their supermajority status following a key Democratic pickup in the House. [2] Republicans needed to maintain all 72 of their House seats to keep their veto-proof majority. The map below shows the states that have a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor after the 2024 elections.  States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors States with potential for veto-proof state legislatures and opposing party governors Ballotpedia identified two states with state legislative elections in 2024 that had the potential to gain a veto-proof majority of the party opposite the governor: Nevada and Wisconsin . Neither state became a veto-proof legislature and opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Nevada : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Nevada was Joe Lombardo (R). In Nevada, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Democratic Party held majorities in both chambers of the legislature that were below the threshold for a veto-proof majority. Democrats had 26-14 majority in the Nevada State Assembly (a two-thirds majority would require 28 seats) and a 13-7 majority in the Nevada State Senate (a two-thirds majority would require 14 seats). After the 2024 elections, Democrats had a 27-15 majority in the Assembly and a 13-8 majority in the Senate. Wisconsin : Heading into the 2024 elections, the governor of Wisconsin was Tony Evers (D). In Wisconsin, two-thirds of the state legislature is required to override a gubernatorial veto. Before the election, the Republican Party reached the two-thirds threshold in the Wisconsin State Senate with its 22-10 majority but was short of this threshold in the Wisconsin State Assembly with its 64-35 majority. Republicans would need to control 66 Assembly seats to reach the two-thirds threshold. Republicans won 54 Assembly seats and 18 Senate seats. Accordingly, Wisconsin did not become a veto-proof supermajority with an opposing party governor as a result of the 2024 elections. Summary of election outcomes Summary of election outcomes The following table includes state legislatures that gained , lost , or maintained veto-proof majority status in the 2024 elections.

There are three states — North Carolina , Vermont , and Wisconsin —that could have switched to having a veto-proof majority and an opposing party governor as a result of the 2022 elections. State legislatures with veto-proof majorities State legislatures with veto-proof majorities After the November 2022 elections, there were 27 state legislatures where one party held a veto-proof majority in both legislative chambers. [3] The number grew to 29 in 2023 due to legislators who switched parties . Republicans controlled twenty of the veto-proof legislatures, and Democrats controlled nine.  State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party State legislatures with veto-proof majorities and governor of the opposing party Two of four states heading into the 2022 elections that had a veto-proof legislative majority and governor of the opposing party— Kentucky and Kansas —maintained that status after the elections. The other two states— Maryland and Massachusetts —no longer have that status since the party that held veto-proof legislative majorities also gained control of the governor's office in the 2022 elections. Vermont became a state with a veto-proof legislative majority and opposing-party governor as a result of the 2022 elections.

Click here for more details. As a result of the 2024 elections, there were 21 Republicans, 14 Democrats, and 5 independent members in the chamber. Elections for all 40 seats in the House took place on November 5, 2024. Ballotpedia identified elections in 15 districts as battleground elections . Members of the Alaska House formed multipartisan majority coalitions including both Democrats and Republicans after every election between 2016 and 2022. Although Republicans won a majority of seats in all four election years, the coalitions that formed after the 2016 , 2018 , and 2020 elections all included Democratic majorities, while the coalition that formed after the 2022 election included a Republican majority. The pre-election majority coalition included 20 Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent. All four majority coalitions included the members of the Bush Caucus, a group of Democratic and independent legislators representing four rural districts in Alaska's north (Districts 37 , 38 , 39 , and 40 ). Before the election, the Alaska Beacon wrote that the Bush Caucus had influenced Alaska politics for more than five decades because its members "have frequently put regional interests above those of party loyalty, and their willingness to cross the partisan aisle has frequently given them outsized power in the Capitol." [65] The minority coalition included the remaining Democrats and independents as well as Louise Stutes (R). David Eastman (R) did not caucus with either group. [66] The general election made use of ranked-choice voting , a system where voters rank the candidates on their ballot by preference order rather than being required to vote for a single candidate. Under ranked-choice voting, voters are permitted to vote for a single candidate or to rank fewer than four choices. The primaries used a top-four system where all candidates running for a given office appeared on the same ballot and the top four finishers advanced to the general election. Alaska voters approved both systems via a ballot measure in 2020. Another measure repealing the changes and returning to partisan primaries and single-vote general elections was on the 2024 ballot. Ballotpedia identified 15 of the 40 House districts as battlegrounds. Members of the Republican-led majority represented 10 battleground districts, while members of the Democratic-led minority represented the other five.

Before the election, local political observers said a multipartisan coalition including the Bush Caucus in the majority was a possible outcome. According to the Alaska Beacon , before the 2016 elections, "it was common for the Bush Caucus to join Republicans in the majority, the better to advocate for rural priorities." [67] According to the Beacon , "neither Republicans nor Democrats are in position to hold [23] seats, meaning that control of the House could come down to post-election negotiations.

The filing deadline was April 1, 2024 . The Arizona House of Representatives was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There are 99 chambers throughout the country.  All 60 seats in the state House were up for election. Heading into the elections, Republicans had a 31-29 majority. Following the election, Republicans maintained a 33-27 majority. The last time Democrats controlled the chamber was in 1966. [68] At the time of the election, Arizona was one of 10 states with a divided government , since Democrats controlled the governorship and Republicans controlled both chambers of the Legislature . The outcome of the House elections alone could not have changed Arizona's trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the Senate. Arizona had a Republican trifecta from 2009 to 2023. The last time the state had a Democratic trifecta was in 1966. [68] Before the election, Arizona Mirror ’s Jim Small wrote, “Democrats are portraying their Republican opponents as ‘extreme’ and aligned with MAGA politics, while Republicans are casting their challengers as socialists who are too radical for Arizona.” [74] The general elections took place against the backdrop of the Arizona Supreme Court 's 2024 ruling regarding abortion. At the time of the ruling, Arizona had two conflicting abortion laws—an 1864 territorial law banning abortion and a 2022 law with a 15-week ban. [70] The court ruled that the 1864 law took precedence.

Kansas State Senate elections See also: Kansas State Senate elections, 2024 All 40 seats in the Kansas Senate were up for election on November 5, 2024. Before the election, Republicans held a 29-11 veto-proof majority in the chamber, and members were elected to four-year terms. Following the election, Republicans maintained a 31-9 veto-proof majority. With more than two-thirds control in each chamber, Republicans held a veto-proof majority, giving them the power to override Gov. Laura Kelly 's (D) veto. It was one of four states with a veto-proof majority of one party and a governor of another , along with Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont, with a governor of one party and a veto-proof state legislative majority of the opposing party . Democrats would have needed to gain three House seats or three Senate seats to block a Republican supermajority. To maintain their supermajority, Republicans needed to lose fewer than two House seats and fewer than three Senate seats. Kansas was one of 10 states that had a divided government. The outcome of the Senate elections alone could not have changed Kansas' trifecta status because Republicans also controlled the House. Before the elections, Kansas City News Service' s Zane Irwin said the partisan composition of the Legislature could have implications on the state's abortion policies. In 2022, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have prohibited the state from adding a Constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, the Legislature overrode Gov. Kelly's veto on HB2749 , which requires healthcare providers ask women questions about why they're getting an abortion. [79] Irwin also said, "[Democrats] are trying to block a flat tax. Republicans repeatedly have tried to pass a flat tax. Right now we have a multi-tiered tax system, and Republicans would like to bring it to where there's one rate that you pay in Kansas whether you are a low-income individual or are a millionaire. Republicans say that would provide broad-base tax relief at a time when our coffers are relatively flush. Democrats say that it would bring us back to a more austere era under Gov.

Missouri State Senate elections See also: Missouri State Senate elections, 2024 (August 6 Republican primaries) There were nine contested Republican primaries for the Missouri Senate on August 6, 2024. An incumbent ran  in two of those primaries, and seven of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek  re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in Districts 3, 15, 21, 23, and 27 as battleground primaries, all but two of which were for open seats. The Missouri Senate had  the most turnover since the state implemented term-limits in 2002. Of the nine members leaving the chamber in 2024, six left  due to term limits. Three of those six senators—Sen. Bill Eigel (R), Sen. Denny Hoskins (R), and Sen. Andrew Koenig (R)—were members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus. [95] Of the two other members of the Senate who formally identified as Freedom Caucus members, Sen. Rick Brattin (R) advanced from the Republican primary in District 31 , and Sen. Nick Schroer's seat was not up for election. The 2024 primaries took place  in the context of a conflict among Senate Republicans over the future of the party. According to Jonathan Shorman and Kacen Bayless of The Kansas City Star, two groups of Republican senators "have grown more divided this session after senators announced the formation of the new Freedom Caucus with backing from the national States Freedom Caucus." [96] Several Senate Republicans who were not members of the Freedom Caucus criticized the group for their use of the filibuster after the Freedom Caucus filibustered approval of the chamber's journal, a committee referral increasing threshold requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, approval of a new congressional map, and the state's budget. [97] [98] [99] Following the Caucus' January filibuster of a bill that increased requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, President Pro Tempore Caleb Rowden (R) removed four Republican senators who identified with the Freedom Caucus from their committee chairmanships. [97] In explaining why he removed caucus members from their chairmanships, Rowden criticized the caucus' filibuster efforts and said they made it too hard for the Senate to pass legislation. Rowden said, "They [filibustered] repeatedly, day after day for two weeks, basically...It became necessary for us to do something that would indicate that we’re not going to let four guys run the place; it’s just not how this works." [100] Several members of the Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Bill Eigel (R), said Republicans outside of the Freedom Caucus, including Rowden, opposed  the caucus because he believed  they tried to preserve power. Eigel said, "It’s never been about policy for them. It’s been about individuals trying to preserve power at the expense of what we believe are the issues that Republicans sent us to Jefferson City for." [101] Missouri was, at the time of the election, one of 23 states with a Republican trifecta . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature. The Missouri State Senate was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There are 99 chambers throughout the country.  There were nine contested Republican primaries for the Missouri Senate on August 6, 2024. An incumbent ran  in two of those primaries, and seven of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek  re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in Districts 3, 15, 21, 23, and 27 as battleground primaries, all but two of which were for open seats. The Missouri Senate had  the most turnover since the state implemented term-limits in 2002. Of the nine members leaving the chamber in 2024, six left  due to term limits. Three of those six senators—Sen. Bill Eigel (R), Sen. Denny Hoskins (R), and Sen. Andrew Koenig (R)—were members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus. [95] Of the two other members of the Senate who formally identified as Freedom Caucus members, Sen. Rick Brattin (R) advanced from the Republican primary in District 31 , and Sen. Nick Schroer's seat was not up for election. The 2024 primaries took place  in the context of a conflict among Senate Republicans over the future of the party. According to Jonathan Shorman and Kacen Bayless of The Kansas City Star, two groups of Republican senators "have grown more divided this session after senators announced the formation of the new Freedom Caucus with backing from the national States Freedom Caucus." [96] Several Senate Republicans who were not members of the Freedom Caucus criticized the group for their use of the filibuster after the Freedom Caucus filibustered approval of the chamber's journal, a committee referral increasing threshold requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, approval of a new congressional map, and the state's budget. [97] [98] [99] Following the Caucus' January filibuster of a bill that increased requirements for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, President Pro Tempore Caleb Rowden (R) removed four Republican senators who identified with the Freedom Caucus from their committee chairmanships. [97] In explaining why he removed caucus members from their chairmanships, Rowden criticized the caucus' filibuster efforts and said they made it too hard for the Senate to pass legislation. Rowden said, "They [filibustered] repeatedly, day after day for two weeks, basically...It became necessary for us to do something that would indicate that we’re not going to let four guys run the place; it’s just not how this works." [100] Several members of the Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Bill Eigel (R), said Republicans outside of the Freedom Caucus, including Rowden, opposed  the caucus because he believed  they tried to preserve power. Eigel said, "It’s never been about policy for them. It’s been about individuals trying to preserve power at the expense of what we believe are the issues that Republicans sent us to Jefferson City for." [101] Missouri was, at the time of the election, one of 23 states with a Republican trifecta . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature.

The Nevada Senate was one of 85 state legislative chambers with elections in 2024 . There were 99 chambers throughout the country. Following the election, Democrats maintained a 13-8 majority. Nevada remained a divided government, with a Republican holding the governorship and Democrats maintaining majorities in the state legislature. Nevada Current's April Corbin Girnus wrote, "Democrats already have a supermajority in the Assembly. If Democrats can maintain that and flip a Senate seat, they will have enough votes to override any veto by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo." [102] Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) said  the prospect of a Democratic supermajority was "a huge concern and so much of a concern that I've been proactive in identifying candidates and supporting current candidates on the Republican side of the aisle." [103] Lombardo vetoed a state record of 75 bills during the 2023 legislative session. [104] Democrats campaigned against Lombardo's vetoes, and said he vetoed legislation that voters supported. [105] Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D) said the legislative elections offered a choice between Democrats who he said "are actually trying to solve problems and make life better for Nevadans, or Republicans, who offer nothing but complaints with no real solutions to any of the challenges facing Nevadans." [106] Assemblyman Gregory Hafen (R) was critical of the prospect of a super majority saying "It makes me very nervous to have one party control because the Nevada Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to implement any new tax. So not only is the Governor’s veto at stake here, but we’re talking about any tax that could be passed with just one party control." [107] At the time of the election, Nevada was one of 10 states that had a divided government . Republican Joe Lombardo (R) was governor while Democrats held majorities in both chambers of the Nevada Legislature .

An incumbent ran in 33 of those primaries, and nine of those primaries were open, meaning an incumbent did not seek re-election in those districts. Ballotpedia identified the Republican primaries in districts 7, 9, 24, 30, 43, 50, and 57 as battleground primaries. The primaries in districts 24 and 30 were for open seats, while incumbents faced primary challengers in districts 7, 9, 43, 50, and 57. The 2024 elections took place in the context of a conflict among House Republicans. While 57 of 62 House members were Republican, 26 voted with the Freedom Caucus, and 12 officially identified with the Freedom Caucus. [164] [165] This was a significant increase from 2017 when just five members identified with the Freedom Caucus. According to the Cowboy State Daily' s Leo Wolfson, "While Republicans have a supermajority in Wyoming, there’s a growing division between the Freedom Caucus and others in the party who say they’re too far right. Conversely, members of the Freedom Caucus have said these more centrist Republicans as being 'liberals' and couch them as adversaries who side with Democrats. There are 25-26 Republican members of the Wyoming House who are politically aligned with the Freedom Caucus. That leaves about 31 other Republicans and the five Democrats. Based on those numbers, the Freedom Caucus could gain as few as three seats to claim a majority of the Republican seats in the House. It would have to gain at least five or six seats to take a full majority." [166] According to WyoFile' s Maya Shimizu Harris, "In recent years, Republicans in Wyoming’s GOP-dominated Legislature have calcified into two distinct factions. That’s particularly the case in the House of Representatives where, last year, a group of lawmakers called the Wyoming Freedom Caucus staked their claim after partnering with a Washington, D.C.-based organization — the State Freedom Caucus Network — that aims to establish similar groups across the nation.... The partnership provides the group with a state director — Jessica Rubino, the spouse of Secretary of State Chief Policy Officer and Hageman nephew Joe Rubino — to research bills and provide vote recommendations." [164] Over the past two years, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has supported legislation to lower taxes, eliminate gun-free zones, ban abortions, ensure the state has closed primaries, and prohibit certain medical procedures for minors. [164] [167] [168] [169] [170] Because two-thirds of the chamber must approve measures for them to be included in the budget, the Freedom Caucus had sufficient numbers to block measures from being proposed in the budget. Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. John Bear (R) said the group "will not be deterred from exposing waste at all levels of government, nor the loss of our society’s moral compass by so many in the name of progress. It is what our voters sent us to Cheyenne to do." [171] [172] Freedom Caucus opponents formed a group called the Wyoming Caucus. State Rep. Clark Stith (R), a member of the Wyoming Caucus, said, "The most striking feature of the House Freedom Caucus this last session was they were voting in lockstep in accordance with text-message instructions that they would receive...The interesting effect of that is that it, to some extent, forced the remaining members of the House to become slightly more organized." Some Democratic representatives expressed alignment with the Wyoming Caucus during budget negotiations. Rep. Karlee Provenza (D) said, "Team Wyoming and the Democrats were voting on how to spend government money to benefit the people of Wyoming, knowing that some money has to be spent.

Ballotpedia identified eight of those primaries as battlegrounds . Click here for a breakdown of the individual battleground primaries. The primaries took place in the context of disagreements between two legislative caucuses. According to WyoFile , the state Republican Party was, at the time of the election, "divided between traditionalist and hard-line factions," with the Wyoming Caucus representing the former and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus representing the latter. Since its founding, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus "managed to push through measures that initially appeared destined to die, such as legislation to restrict crossover voting and an abortion ban that’s now held up in court." [174] Wyoming's 2024 legislative primaries were more competitive than any in the preceding decade. There were the highest numbers of contested Republican primaries (54), Republican candidates running (141), and contested primaries involving Republican incumbents (41) than in any year since at least 2010.

[177] The eight primaries Ballotpedia identified as battlegrounds included two elections where Wyoming Caucus-aligned and Wyoming Freedom Caucus-aligned candidates ran for open seats. The six battlegrounds with an incumbent on the ballot included four where the incumbent faced a Wyoming Caucus-aligned challenger and two where the incumbent faced a Wyoming Freedom Caucus-aligned challenger. All six incumbents running in battleground districts won their primaries. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus-aligned candidate won both battleground primaries without an incumbent on the ballot. As of August 18, 2024, Republicans controlled the Wyoming Senate with a 29-2 majority. Fifteen seats were up for election. A Democratic candidate filed to run in three of those seats, meaning Republicans maintained their Senate majority regardless of the election outcome. As of the 2024 election, Wyoming was one of 23 Republican trifectas . A state government trifecta is a term used to describe a single-party government where one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature.  There were 11 contested Republican primaries for the Wyoming State Senate that took place on August 20, 2024. Ballotpedia identified eight of those primaries as battlegrounds . Click here for a breakdown of the individual battleground primaries. The primaries took place in the context of disagreements between two legislative caucuses. According to WyoFile , the state Republican Party was, at the time of the election, "divided between traditionalist and hard-line factions," with the Wyoming Caucus representing the former and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus representing the latter. Since its founding, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus "managed to push through measures that initially appeared destined to die, such as legislation to restrict crossover voting and an abortion ban that’s now held up in court." [174] Wyoming's 2024 legislative primaries were more competitive than any in the preceding decade. There were the highest numbers of contested Republican primaries (54), Republican candidates running (141), and contested primaries involving Republican incumbents (41) than in any year since at least 2010.

[178] [179] Fifteen of those leaders (16.3%) faced contested primaries. [180] Of those, 11 were Republicans and four were Democrats. Three legislative leaders were defeated in their primaries, representing 20.0% of those who faced primaries and 3.3% of all legislative leaders seeking re-election. The 15 state legislators who faced primary challengers included three Idaho legislators as well as two each from Nevada and West Virginia. Click [show] on the table below for a table detailing the results of contested primaries involving state legislative leaders in 2024.

One Republican served as president, one as president pro tempore , one as majority leader, and one Democrat served as speaker. Valerie Longhurst Valerie Longhurst First elected in 2003, Longhurst had served as Delaware's speaker of the House from 2023-2024. [183] Longhurst was previously the House Majority Whip from 2008-2012 and the House Majority Leader from 2012-2023. [183] Longhurst lost the Democratic primary to Kamela Smith (D) 53.3%-46.7%. During the primary, Longhurst's campaign website said, "Representative Valerie Longhurst has been diligently serving members of the 15th District since 2004 and has been instrumental in passing important, impactful legislation in various policy areas, including: mental and behavioral Health, quality public education, public safety and criminal justice reform, environment and energy, economic empowerment, health and quality of life, [and] women’s issues." [184] Delaware Online' s Shane Brennan said, "Voter turnout was consistently slow. Signs and workers representing state house representative candidates were not as common or visible as candidates for Wilmington, New Castle County and governor races." [185] [186] Smith was endorsed by the Working Families Party during the primary, and said, "Once I’m in Dover, I’ll be pushing for government transparency, better education, health care, and housing, and the investments in our people that they deserve." [187] [185] Scott Saiki Scott Saiki First elected in 1994, Saiki had served as Hawaii's speaker of the House since May 2017. Saiki was previously the House majority leader from 2013-2017. Saiki lost the Democratic primary to Kim Coco Iwamoto (D) 49.3%-44.6%. [188] During the campaign, Saiki's campaign website said, "When I think about the future for Hawaiʻi, I think about how we can create a more affordable Hawaiʻi. I believe that we need to address the root causes of why so many local families struggle: cost of living, housing that can be affordable for all, and public safety so that our ʻohana can thrive." [189] Spectrum News' Michael Tsai said local media expected a close race between Saiki and Iwamoto after the two candidates had competed against each other in the previous two election years. Tsai said, "Saiki had defeated Iwamoto by less than 200 votes in each of the last two elections...Iwamoto, an attorney and former state Board of Education member, previously fell short in races for state Senate District 13 and lieutenant governor in 2018. With her win on Saturday, she becomes the first transgender woman elected to the state Legislature." Chuck Winder Chuck Winder First elected in 2008, Winder had served as Idaho's senate president pro tempore since December 2020. [190] Winder lost the Republican primary to Josh Keyser (R) 52.3%–47.7%. Winder ran on his experience, with his campaign website quoting an editorial describing the incumbent as a "force of stability...a true conservative," saying Winder had "stepped up to oppose extremism while many others have remained silent." [191] Keyser ran as a political outsider, saying he would "offer a fresh perspective to help navigate the complex challenges we face in our beautiful state." [192] Idaho media identified Winder's opposition to the Idaho Freedom Caucus as an element in his defeat. Ahead of the 2024 legislative session, Winder removed two caucus members from committee leadership positions and disciplined a third, saying the members had posted content on social media that was defamatory to fellow legislative Republicans. Following the removal, the Republican Party of Ada County—Idaho's largest county—censured Winder. [193] In an interview with the Idaho Press , Winder said his opposition to the affiliated Idaho Freedom Foundation was a factor in his defeat. [194] Greg McCortney Greg McCortney First elected in 2016, McCortney had served as Oklahoma's senate majority leader since October 2021 and was selected earlier in 2024 to serve as president pro tempore after the 2024 elections. [195] [196] McCortney lost the Republican primary to Jonathan Wingard (R) 51.8%–48.2%. McCortney said he was running "to continue working for the things that make our area truly special things [ sic ] like our conservative values, strong schools, an improved economy, protecting our natural resources and promoting agriculture and energy." [197] Wingard ran on his military experience and values, saying he would "fight for you as a conservative, value-driven Oklahoman...It is my honor and privilege to ask you to join me as we fight the good fight of faith, freedom and rights." [198] KFOR political analyst Mike Turpen said the earlier timing of the 2024 legislative primaries as well as McCortney's business as a legislative leader were factors in the election because they left the incumbent with less time to campaign: "Everybody’s telling me this move, moving the election up a week… It cost him and others the ability to go campaign at home...And that was critical time lost on the campaign trail." [199] In an interview with KGOU , political science professor and district resident Christine Pappas said the results were a surprise: "It just kind of seemed like a regular old campaign where you expect the incumbent to win with 65%, 70% of the vote. And it was just quite shocking to see the outcome, which had Wingard narrowly beating McCortney. In fact, McCortney won no counties." [200] Craig Blair Craig Blair First elected in 2012, Blair had served as West Virginia's senate president since December 2020. [201] Blair lost the Republican primary to Tom Willis (R) 44.4%–32.2%. A third candidate, Michael Folk (R), received 23.4% of the vote. Blair ran on his experience in leadership, with his campaign website saying he "passed major reforms that led to more people working and being paid higher wages than ever before," "led the effort in the state legislature to pass the largest tax cut in history," and "passed the most pro-life legislation in state history which made abortion illegal in West Virginia." [202] Willis ran on his military experience and his involvement in the community, saying he was "the leader we need to build a better West Virginia." [203] Local media coverage discussed Blair's loss in the context of other incumbent defeats in the state senate. Blair was one of four state senators to lose a primary out of the 14 who filed for re-election in 2024. West Virginia MetroNews correspondent Brad McElhinny said Blair emphasized different policies than his two challengers: "Blair was conservative but emphasized his passion for economic development, for growth in West Virginia...The other two guys, Willis and (Mike) Folk, were much more animated by cultural issues." In an interview with MetroNews , consultant Greg Thomas said the district's demographics worked against Blair: "It’s the fastest growing part or [ sic ] the state and you have a lot of new voters which diminishes the power of the incumbency."

State legislative special elections State legislative special elections In 2024, 52 state legislative special elections were scheduled for 2024 in 22 states. Between 2011 and 2023, an average of 71 special elections took place each year. Impact of term limits Impact of term limits In 2024, 179 state legislators —77 state senators and 102 state representatives—were term-limited in 2024. This represented 3.1% of the 5,807 total seats up for election in November 2024. [205] There were fewer term-limited legislators in 2024 than in 2022 and 2020. In 2022 and 2020, there were 252 and 211 term-limited state legislators, respectively. Ballotpedia tracked the most term-limited legislators in 2010 when 375 legislators were termed out. 100 Republicans were term-limited, while 66 Democrats and 13 independents were term-limited. In even-numbered election years between 2010 and 2022, Democrats averaged about 99 term-limited legislators, while Republicans averaged 148 term-limited legislators. The Nebraska State Senate and Montana House of Representatives had the highest percentage of term-limited legislators in 2024. In the Nebraska Senate, 52% of the incumbents up for election were term-limited, while 17% of the Montana House were term-limited. Electoral competitiveness Electoral competitiveness Ballotpedia's 14th Annual State Legislative Competitiveness Report analyzed all 5,807 state legislative seats that were up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. State legislative competitiveness in 2024 was below average for even years from 2010 to 2024. In 2024, the nationwide State Legislative Competitiveness Index was 33.2 , down from the last three election cycles: 2022 (36.6), 2020 (33.4), and 2018 (36.1). State legislative competitiveness in 2024  (33.2) was below the 14-year competitiveness index average of 34.0. This average was for even-year elections only. Looking at averages across the last three even-year election cycles: 2024 had fewer open seats, incumbents in contested primaries, and seats with major competition. Key findings of this report include: 962 seats were open (16.6%) . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries (21.4%) . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 26.8% in 2022 but higher than the 20.1% in 2020. 3,583 seats were contested by both major parties (61.7%) , higher than in 2022 (59.2%) but lower than in 2018 (66.3%) and 2020 (65.2%).

Open seats Open seats There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, there were 962 open seats , guaranteeing at least 17% of all seats would be won by newcomers . This was the second-smallest number of open seats since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of open seats to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A greater number of open seats guarantees more newcomers entering legislatures and typically results in more candidates running for office. A smaller number of open seats guarantees fewer newcomers and typically results in fewer candidates running for office. In 2024 : There were 407 open Democratic seats , those most recently held by Democrats at the time of filing. There were 545 open Republican seats , those most recently held by Republicans at the time of filing. There were 10 other open seats . This includes those most recently held by minor party or independent officeholders at the time of filing. The total number of open seats—962—was higher than in 2020 (876), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 10% increase.

The "Other" value includes seats left open by minor party and independent officeholders.  Contested primaries Contested primaries There were 5,470 state legislative districts up for election nationwide, creating 10,642 possible primaries . Of that total, there were 1,731 contested primaries , meaning 16% of all primaries were contested . This percentage is tied with 2014 (16%) as the lowest percentage of contested primaries since Ballotpedia began gathering data in 2010. 5,470 state legislative districts 10,642 possible primaries In 2024 : There were 608 contested Democratic primaries , representing 12% of all possible Democratic primaries and a 27% decrease from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 1,005 contested Republican primaries , representing 19% of all possible Republican primaries and a 14% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. There were 118 contested top-two/four primaries , representing 40% of all possible top-two/four primaries and an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. The total number of contested primaries—1,731—was down from 2020 (1,827), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 5% decrease.

Incumbents in contested primaries Incumbents in contested primaries There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Overall, 4,853 incumbents filed for re-election and were running at the time of their respective primaries. Of that total, 1,039 incumbents faced contested primaries , representing 21% of all incumbents who filed for re-election . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 27% in 2022 but higher than the 20% in 2020. Ballotpedia uses the number and percentage of incumbents in contested primaries to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of contested primaries indicates more opportunities for voters to elect a non-incumbent to office. A smaller number indicates fewer of those opportunities. In 2024 : There were 365 Democratic incumbents in contested primaries , representing 17% of all Democratic incumbents who filed for re-election, a 26% decrease from 2020. There were 674 Republican incumbents in contested primaries , representing 26% of all Republican incumbents who filed for re-election, a 32% increase from 2020.

Major party competition Major party competition There were 5,807 state legislative seats up for election on November 5, 2024, in 44 states. Of that total, 2,224 (38%) were uncontested and had no major party competition . This was roughly average compared to previous years, down from 41% in 2022 but higher than the 34% and 35% in 2018 and 2020, respectively. The remaining 3,583 (62%) seats were contested by both major parties. Ballotpedia uses the level of major party competition to help determine the overall competitiveness of an election cycle. A larger number of seats without major party competition indicates fewer options on the ballot. A smaller number indicates more options. In 2024 : Democrats were guaranteed to win 1,111 seats (19%) that lacked Republican competition, an 8% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Republicans were guaranteed to win 1,109 seats (19%) that lacked Democratic competition, a 10% increase from 2020, the last time all 44 states held elections. Overall, Democrats ran for 4,694 seats (81%) and Republicans ran for 4,692 (81%). There were four seats guaranteed to minor party or independent candidates because no major party candidates ran. The total number of seats without major party competition—2,224—was more than in 2020 (2,044), the last time all 44 states held elections, representing a 9% increase. One of the two major parties was guaranteed a simple majority in 19 chambers across 14 states due to the lack of major party competition.

Additionally, in Alaska, a bipartisan governing coalition comprised of Democrats and Republicans won control of the Alaska Senate. Republicans previously controlled all five chambers. Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023  Changes in chamber partisan control, 2010 to 2023 From 2010 to 2023, 41 chambers switched control: 21 switched control once, 15 switched control twice, four switched control four times, and one—the New Hampshire House of Representatives —switched control five times. During that same time, there were 58 chambers that did not switch control. Before the 2010 elections, Democrats controlled 60 of the country's 99 state legislative chambers, Republicans controlled 37, and neither party controlled the remaining two chambers. After the 2023 elections, Democrats controlled 41 chambers and Republicans controlled 56. Multipartisan majorities controlled the Alaska Senate and House. Most changes in partisan control came from major elections, but some also came through special elections (Louisiana House in 2010; Washington Senate in 2017) and party-switching (Louisiana House in 2010; Mississippi Senate in 2011). In some cases, the party that gained control did not have a numerical majority but instead controlled the chamber through a bipartisan coalition (i.e., Alaska House in 2016). This table does not account for changes in party control or ties in a chamber that lasted for less than one year and were not the result of a regularly scheduled election. An example of this is the brief period of Democratic control in the Virginia State Senate in 2014. [207] For this chart, a red box indicates that the chamber changed from Democratic to Republican control, and a blue box indicates that the chamber changed from Republican to Democratic control.

From 2010 to 2018, the Republican Party increased its number of trifectas and the Democratic Party saw a decline in its trifectas. Democrats picked up six trifectas in the 2018 elections, and Republicans lost four trifectas. Following the 2021 elections, the Democratic trifecta in Virginia became a split government after Republicans gained control of the state House and governorship . After the 2023 elections, the divided government in Louisiana became a Republican trifecta when Jeff Landry (R) won election as governor. This chart shows the number of trifectas each party held heading into elections from 2010 to 2023, and the number of trifectas following the 2023 elections.

Annual State Legislative Competitiveness Report: Vol. 12, 2022 : Competitiveness refers to the presence of choice throughout the election cycle. A greater level of competitiveness means voters have the ability to make more decisions. A lower level of competitiveness equals fewer choices. State legislative competitiveness in 2022 reached its highest level compared to all even-year election cycles since 2010. In 2022, the nationwide State Legislative Competitiveness Index is 36.2, beating out 2018 (36.1) and the 2012 post-redistricting cycle (35.2).
