Read More Blueprint for public safety Brad will reduce crime, confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Read More Stand up to Donald Trump As Donald Trump and Elon Musk threaten our neighbors and our services, Brad will bring New Yorkers together and stand up for women, the LGBTQ community, workers, our immigrant neighbors, people of color, Jews, Muslims, or any other New Yorkers subjected to hate or attack. Read More Protect reproductive rights Brad will ensure that New York remains a haven for women’s health – strengthening protections against federal threats, expanding abortion access citywide, increasing practical support for out-of-state travelers, improving emergency care, and broadening access to contraception and comprehensive sex education. Read More Fight hate and harassment Amidst a rise in hate crimes and antisemitism, Brad will adopt cutting-edge technology to identify extremist threats online and prevent violence before it starts. Read More End retail theft Brad will stop retail theft – and free items behind lock and key at drugstores – by launching a simple, one-stop platform to streamline reporting, investigating, and preventing shoplifters. Read More Prepare for the climate crisis Cleaner air. Cheaper energy. Better parks and transit.

Read More Stand up for our immigrant neighbors Brad understands that immigrant New Yorkers are the economic engine of our city and will stand up for our neighbors against authoritarian attacks from the Trump administration. He will ensure immigrant New Yorkers can obtain legal services, work authorization, case management, and more.

Read More Back to top Brad’s solutions for a more affordable city Guarantee child care & afterschool for all Brad will restore Mayor Adams’ cuts to child care so that we can fulfill the promise of genuinely universal Pre-K and 3-K, then work with New Yorkers United for Child Care to expand to 2-K. He will deliver free, high-quality afterschool programming for K through 8th graders. Brad will also ensure that child care workers receive the fair pay they deserve for caring for our kids. Read More Solve the housing crisis Brad will declare a state of emergency on the housing crisis – so we can cut through red tape, build 500,000 new units of housing, protect tenants from eviction and skyrocketing rents, and increase pathways to home ownership. He’ll fix our broken housing agencies to deliver progress on the housing New Yorkers need. Read More Protect workers’ rights Brad will create a new Mayor’s Office of Workers’ Rights to coordinate the use of all of the City’s tools – contracting, concessions, legislation, franchising, economic development, tax breaks, transparency – to support and protect workers. Read More Fix NYCHA Brad will triple capital investment in the agency and directly empower tenants. Brad will leverage resident feedback through a "Yelp for NYCHA Repairs" system to strengthen property management, ensure residents have a majority vote on decisions affecting their homes, and offer multiple pathways for rehabilitation. Read More Protect health care Brad will fight to improve health care coverage, ensure low deductibles and premiums, and protect New Yorkers with preexisting conditions. He will stand up for women’s health care, reproductive freedom, and maternal health against authoritarian attacks and protect city retirees from being forced onto inferior Medicaid Advantage plans.

Read More Provide world-class public education Brad will deliver universal Pre-K and 3K (alongside a “2-Care for All” program), create universal after-school programs, and invest in educators. He will expand proven mental health programs and limit the use of smartphones in schools. Brad will invest in CUNY – the City’s most powerful springboard to the middle class – to better prepare the next generation of New York City’s teachers, nurses, and entrepreneurs. Read More Strengthen NYC’s economy Brad will ensure a growing, inclusive economy where workers can thrive and where diverse entrepreneurs start and grow successful businesses with confidence.

He will monitor the City’s debt, prioritize long-term savings, and adopt fiscally responsible policies to ensure that City contractors get paid on time. Read More Attract & retain a world-class City workforce Brad will breathe life into the municipal workforce – reforming outdated civil service rules, attracting and retaining the best talent, and restoring a relationship of mutual respect between New Yorkers and their teachers, cops, and municipal employees. He’ll create a “Homes for City Workers” program that will make affordable homeownership possible for municipal workers. Read More Lead with public integrity It’s time to stop corruption in City Hall. Brad will restore trust in City Hall with comprehensive reforms to close lobbying loopholes, fight corruption in contracting, make COIB independent, increase transparency and media accessibility, and more. Read More Leverage technology to make government work Brad will modernize municipal technology (including the use of AI) to make City government work better. He will make sure City agencies utilize data more effectively to drive decisions and improve how the public accesses government services.

Honest and tough-minded, Brad has devoted his life to fighting for New York City – and has the record of results to prove it. Brad is fed up with City government that’s failing to deliver for New Yorkers. As the current New York City Comptroller , Lander has been the City’s watchdog, holding Mayor Eric Adams accountable and saving taxpayers over $2.5 billion. As a City Council Member and as a housing leader for two decades before entering elected office, Brad preserved and created tens of thousands of units of genuinely affordable housing. Brad’s top priorities as Mayor are to end homelessness for people with serious mental illness , declare a “state of emergency” to combat the housing affordability crisis , and make our communities safer . Brad is the only candidate who brings three things New York City needs most right now: strong, experienced leadership, outstanding public integrity , and real solutions to tackle our toughest problems. As Donald Trump and Elon Musk deport our neighbors, illegally claw back federal funds, and undermine our democracy, we urgently need a Mayor who will stand up for New York City and run it better so that we can prove our shared values work. Brad lives with his wife, Meg Barnette, in Brooklyn where they raised two children, Marek and Rosa, both of whom graduated from NYC public schools. He loves Prospect Park, CUNY graduations, NYC street food, and is a proud season ticket holder for WNBA champions the New York Liberty.

As Comptroller, Brad led the New York City public pension funds in developing and adopting the most ambitious plan in the country to reach net zero emissions by 2040. Brad has engaged actively with portfolio companies toward this goal through proxy voting and shareholder initiatives, recently pushing major banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Royal Bank of Canada to agree to disclose their fossil fuel versus clean energy funding ratios, a critical step toward decarbonization.

Read More Stand up for our immigrant neighbors Brad understands that immigrant New Yorkers are the economic engine of our city and will stand up for our neighbors against authoritarian attacks from the Trump administration. He will ensure immigrant New Yorkers can obtain legal services, work authorization, case management, and more.

He’ll fix our broken housing agencies to deliver progress on the housing New Yorkers need. Read More Protect workers’ rights Brad will create a new Mayor’s Office of Workers’ Rights to coordinate the use of all of the City’s tools – contracting, concessions, legislation, franchising, economic development, tax breaks, transparency – to support and protect workers. Read More Fix NYCHA Brad will triple capital investment in the agency and directly empower tenants. Brad will leverage resident feedback through a "Yelp for NYCHA Repairs" system to strengthen property management, ensure residents have a majority vote on decisions affecting their homes, and offer multiple pathways for rehabilitation. Read More Protect health care Brad will fight to improve health care coverage, ensure low deductibles and premiums, and protect New Yorkers with preexisting conditions. He will stand up for women’s health care, reproductive freedom, and maternal health against authoritarian attacks and protect city retirees from being forced onto inferior Medicaid Advantage plans. Read More Better public transportation Brad will continue leading the fight to improve our subways and buses, reduce traffic crashes to save lives, and make our streets and neighborhoods more livable. Read More Provide world-class public education Brad will deliver universal Pre-K and 3K (alongside a “2-Care for All” program), create universal after-school programs, and invest in educators. He will expand proven mental health programs and limit the use of smartphones in schools. Brad will invest in CUNY – the City’s most powerful springboard to the middle class – to better prepare the next generation of New York City’s teachers, nurses, and entrepreneurs. Read More Strengthen NYC’s economy Brad will ensure a growing, inclusive economy where workers can thrive and where diverse entrepreneurs start and grow successful businesses with confidence. Brad will strengthen the economy by creating a "virtuous cycle," attracting people and investment, and reinvesting the revenue into vibrant public spaces and essential services – driving inclusive growth and innovation. Read More Back to top Brad’s solutions for a better-run city Make City Hall fiscally responsible Brad will grow the City’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and create a new “Protecting NYC Reserve” with billions of dollars from existing revenue sources to prepare our city Elon Musk and Donald Trump's next attack – like when they illegally stole $80 million from New Yorkers. He will monitor the City’s debt, prioritize long-term savings, and adopt fiscally responsible policies to ensure that City contractors get paid on time. Read More Attract & retain a world-class City workforce Brad will breathe life into the municipal workforce – reforming outdated civil service rules, attracting and retaining the best talent, and restoring a relationship of mutual respect between New Yorkers and their teachers, cops, and municipal employees. He’ll create a “Homes for City Workers” program that will make affordable homeownership possible for municipal workers. Read More Lead with public integrity It’s time to stop corruption in City Hall. Brad will restore trust in City Hall with comprehensive reforms to close lobbying loopholes, fight corruption in contracting, make COIB independent, increase transparency and media accessibility, and more. Read More Leverage technology to make government work Brad will modernize municipal technology (including the use of AI) to make City government work better. He will make sure City agencies utilize data more effectively to drive decisions and improve how the public accesses government services. Read More Fix NYC’s outdoor dining program Brad will fix the broken and burdensome Dining Out NYC program to ensure a vibrant future for outdoor dining. By cutting bureaucratic red tape at the Department of Transportation, he will keep our streets lively, our neighborhoods thriving, and our restaurants flourishing.

Back to Issues Brad's Solution MORE: Brad's Record on Workers' Rights In the City Council, Brad’s “fair work week” legislation ended cruel and erratic scheduling for fast-food and retail workers, giving them advance notice of their schedules, and a pathway to full-time work. His “just cause” legislation ended arbitrary firings in the fast-food industry, and provided a model for job stability that New York City can build upon. Brad passed the first law in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber, Lyft, and other for-hire drivers, putting more than $500 million in the pockets of drivers rather than Uber and Lyft’s bank accounts – without disruption to customers or a loss of service. Brad introduced and passed the first law in the country requiring minimum pay for deliveristas working for DoorDash, Grubhub, Seamless, Uber Eats, and other food service apps – and fought successfully to preserve the law when lobbyists sought to undercut it at City Hall and quash it in the courts. Brad worked with the Freelancers Union to create and pass the “Freelance Isn’t Free Act,” which gives groundbreaking protections to independent contractors to ensure they are paid on time and in full, and hundreds of freelancers have now recovered millions of dollars they were owed. He also passed a law extending the benefits of New York City’s Human Rights Law to freelancers and independent contractors, ensuring that they are protected from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. As Comptroller and investment advisor to the five New York City pension funds, Brad has overseen a wide array of investments delivering strong returns for the City’s $270+ billion portfolio – while consistently leading efforts to ensure that companies with whom New York City invests treat their workers with dignity and respect and allow their workers to join a union without interference. His landmark shareholder proposal at Starbucks required an independent assessment of its labor practices and helped lead to a groundbreaking national agreement between the company and the union representing workers across the country. Brad rebuilt the Bureau of Labor Law and expanded the work the Comptroller’s office does on behalf of workers within New York City and around the world. He established prevailing wage rates for Staten Island Ferry workers, ending a multi-year legal dispute between hundreds of Ferry workers and New York City, leading to over $30 million dollars in backpay for those essential workers. He has also recovered more than $8 million in back wages and civil penalties for New York City’s prevailing wage workers including construction workers, temp workers, building service workers, and security officers.

Back to Issues MORE: Brad's Record on Education The father of two NYC public school graduates, Brad knows that public schools are central to our families’ and our city’s future. In the City Council, Brad invested millions in his communities’ public schools. He led the campaign that secured air-conditioning in all NYC school classrooms, after working with students on a policy report showing that 25% of classrooms did not have air conditioning. Brad led the effort to enact the School Diversity Accountability Act , requiring the Department of Education to report annually on their plan to fight student demographics and pushing the Department of Education to produce a plan to confront school segregation and improve school quality. He worked closely with parents, students, and educators to adopt a bold integration plan for the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 , in the heart of his own district as a Council Member, that is showing encouraging signs of success. A recent report from the Comptroller’s office shows how inclusive school mergers can simultaneously reduce class sizes, advance integration, and improve student outcomes. As Comptroller, Brad helped lead the successful fight against Mayor Adams when he proposed to cut the budgets of 77% of the city’s public schools – as they were still reeling from the pandemic – and against his cuts to 3K, Pre-K, and CUNY. He identified comprehensive strategies to simultaneously better serve students with disabilities while saving hundreds of millions of dollars on due process claims.

Back to Issues Brad's Solution MORE: Brad's Record on Housing Before he was elected to the City Council, Brad led two not-for-profit, affordable housing and community development corporations where he built hundreds of affordable housing units and emerged as a leading housing policy expert. In the City Council, Brad spearheaded and championed critical legislation to protect tenants from harassment and displacement, provide a right to legal counsel for tenants, create safe and legal basement apartments, and combat housing discrimination. Brad initiated, championed, and built broad community and political support for the Gowanus planning and rezoning process that will produce 8,500 new housing units, almost 3,000 of which will be affordable to low-income and working-class families, along with investments in open space, arts and industry, environmental remediation, stormwater protection, and NYCHA. Brad’s steadfast leadership in Gowanus – one of the only large-scale rezonings to have the overwhelming support of its local community board – is generating more new development than anywhere else in the City. As Comptroller, Brad issued the City’s first social bonds, generating over $1 billion to finance over 7,000 new units of low-income housing. He initiated an investment in the acquisition of the loan portfolio of the failed Signature Bank that is preserving over 35,000 affordable rental units while yielding strong returns for the pension fund.

He will ensure immigrant New Yorkers have access to the legal services they need to get work authorization, ESL, job training, and case management. This is the most compassionate, cost-effective way to decrease NYC’s shelter population in contrast to the Adams Administration’s cruel shelter limit policies. Back to Issues MORE: Brad's Record on Immigration As a City Council Member, Brad worked under the leadership of Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to pass new policies protecting immigrants from deportation. He was also an early supporter of the effort to expand opportunities for street vendors and to create the New York City ID to help immigrants get access to financial, employment, and other services. Brad helped lead the effort to establish the successful Promise NYC program , which provides child care for families seeking asylum. He passed significant legislation to support immigrant workers and communities, including laws that protect and support Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig-workers, carwasheros , fast-food workers, and vulnerable tenants facing harassment and displacement. As Comptroller, Brad has pushed for a common-sense management approach that uses City dollars more efficiently while setting new arrivals up for success. In July of 2023, Brad urged City agencies to keep prices down and improve services by replacing costly no-bid emergency contracts with vendors selected through a competitive bid process. In September 2023, he used his powers as Comptroller to reject the Adams Administration’s $432 million no-bid contract with DocGo , a for-profit medical staffing company with no experience providing shelter or services for asylum seekers, ultimately leading to its cancellation. His audit of Adams’ no-bid staffing contracts found millions of wasted dollars. Brad’s investigation into the Adams Administration’s implementation of its 60-day shelter limit for asylum-seeking families revealed that City Hall has subjected over 37,000 people to repetitive screenings for shelter alternatives, disrupted families’ efforts to obtain work authorization and legal status, and uprooted children from the schools where they made connections. Despite their differences, Brad initiated an effort with Mayor Adams to partner with philanthropic foundations that have raised millions of dollars to support community-based efforts to help asylum seekers find work and get on their feet.

Brad is the only candidate who brings three things New York City needs most right now: strong, experienced leadership, outstanding public integrity , and real solutions to tackle our toughest problems. As Donald Trump and Elon Musk deport our neighbors, illegally claw back federal funds, and undermine our democracy, we urgently need a Mayor who will stand up for New York City and run it better so that we can prove our shared values work.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Blueprint for public safety Brad will make NYC safer – reducing crime and achieving more effective policing. He will confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Back to Issues Brad's Solution MORE: Brad's Record on Public Safety At the height of the discriminatory use of stop-and-frisk, Brad spearheaded legislation at the City Council along with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams to strengthen the City’s prohibition on racial profiling and create the office of the NYPD Inspector General. What followed were dramatic declines in discriminatory stop-and-frisk, accompanied by dramatic declines in crime. Additionally while in the Council, Brad sponsored a resolution in favor of pending legislation within the New York State Legislature to enact extensive gun control laws including waiting periods, background checks, and safety certificates. As Comptroller, Brad’s hard-hitting audits and reports have exposed the failures of Mayor Adams’ approach to public safety, like sweeps of homeless encampments that place just 0.1% of people into permanent housing. Brad’s audit of ShotSpotter , a gunfire location and detection technology contracted by the NYPD, revealed that alerts only identified confirmed shootings 13% of the time. As a trustee of the Police Pension Fund, Brad worked alongside union representatives to protect retirement security and ensure disability decisions were handled with integrity and consistency. Brad partnered with police unions to secure disability benefits for officers who contracted long Covid. He also fought to ensure that the family of Officer Adeed Fayaz, who was killed in the line of duty, received the death benefits they deserved. Brad led the pension systems to call on American Express, MasterCard and Visa to support a proposal to establish a merchant category code (MCC) for gun and ammunition stores. The MCC code would allow financial institutions to both locate and report large purchases of firearms and ammunition – purchases that have the potential to be used for criminal purchases. Blueprint for public safety Brad will make NYC safer – reducing crime and achieving more effective policing. He will confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Back to Issues Back to Issues MORE: Brad's Record on Public Safety At the height of the discriminatory use of stop-and-frisk, Brad spearheaded legislation at the City Council along with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams to strengthen the City’s prohibition on racial profiling and create the office of the NYPD Inspector General. What followed were dramatic declines in discriminatory stop-and-frisk, accompanied by dramatic declines in crime. Additionally while in the Council, Brad sponsored a resolution in favor of pending legislation within the New York State Legislature to enact extensive gun control laws including waiting periods, background checks, and safety certificates. As Comptroller, Brad’s hard-hitting audits and reports have exposed the failures of Mayor Adams’ approach to public safety, like sweeps of homeless encampments that place just 0.1% of people into permanent housing. Brad’s audit of ShotSpotter , a gunfire location and detection technology contracted by the NYPD, revealed that alerts only identified confirmed shootings 13% of the time.

Brad is the only candidate who brings three things New York City needs most right now: strong, experienced leadership, outstanding public integrity , and real solutions to tackle our toughest problems.

Read More Blueprint for public safety Brad will reduce crime, confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Read More Stand up to Donald Trump As Donald Trump and Elon Musk threaten our neighbors and our services, Brad will bring New Yorkers together and stand up for women, the LGBTQ community, workers, our immigrant neighbors, people of color, Jews, Muslims, or any other New Yorkers subjected to hate or attack. Read More Protect reproductive rights Brad will ensure that New York remains a haven for women’s health – strengthening protections against federal threats, expanding abortion access citywide, increasing practical support for out-of-state travelers, improving emergency care, and broadening access to contraception and comprehensive sex education. Read More Fight hate and harassment Amidst a rise in hate crimes and antisemitism, Brad will adopt cutting-edge technology to identify extremist threats online and prevent violence before it starts. Read More End retail theft Brad will stop retail theft – and free items behind lock and key at drugstores – by launching a simple, one-stop platform to streamline reporting, investigating, and preventing shoplifters. Read More Prepare for the climate crisis Cleaner air. Cheaper energy. Better parks and transit. Brad will equip New York City for the ongoing climate crisis by reducing our carbon emissions, guaranteeing access to affordable clean energy, creating economic opportunities through green jobs and reliable transit, and building more resilient neighborhoods. Read More Trash the rats Brad will improve New Yorkers’ quality-of-life by solving our city’s rat problem and delivering cleaner, healthier streets for all. Unlike Eric Adams’ “Rat Czar” gimmicks and trash bin chaos, Brad’s plan is smart, scalable, and actually works for New York — prioritizing getting food waste and garbage off our streets and sidewalks. Read More Stand up for our immigrant neighbors Brad understands that immigrant New Yorkers are the economic engine of our city and will stand up for our neighbors against authoritarian attacks from the Trump administration. He will ensure immigrant New Yorkers can obtain legal services, work authorization, case management, and more. This is the most compassionate, cost-effective way to decrease NYC’s shelter population in contrast to the Adams Administration’s cruel shelter limit policies. Read More Back to top Brad’s solutions for a more affordable city Guarantee child care & afterschool for all Brad will restore Mayor Adams’ cuts to child care so that we can fulfill the promise of genuinely universal Pre-K and 3-K, then work with New Yorkers United for Child Care to expand to 2-K. He will deliver free, high-quality afterschool programming for K through 8th graders. Brad will also ensure that child care workers receive the fair pay they deserve for caring for our kids. Read More Solve the housing crisis Brad will declare a state of emergency on the housing crisis – so we can cut through red tape, build 500,000 new units of housing, protect tenants from eviction and skyrocketing rents, and increase pathways to home ownership. He’ll fix our broken housing agencies to deliver progress on the housing New Yorkers need. Read More Protect workers’ rights Brad will create a new Mayor’s Office of Workers’ Rights to coordinate the use of all of the City’s tools – contracting, concessions, legislation, franchising, economic development, tax breaks, transparency – to support and protect workers. Read More Fix NYCHA Brad will triple capital investment in the agency and directly empower tenants. Brad will leverage resident feedback through a "Yelp for NYCHA Repairs" system to strengthen property management, ensure residents have a majority vote on decisions affecting their homes, and offer multiple pathways for rehabilitation. Read More Protect health care Brad will fight to improve health care coverage, ensure low deductibles and premiums, and protect New Yorkers with preexisting conditions. He will stand up for women’s health care, reproductive freedom, and maternal health against authoritarian attacks and protect city retirees from being forced onto inferior Medicaid Advantage plans. Read More Better public transportation Brad will continue leading the fight to improve our subways and buses, reduce traffic crashes to save lives, and make our streets and neighborhoods more livable. Read More Provide world-class public education Brad will deliver universal Pre-K and 3K (alongside a “2-Care for All” program), create universal after-school programs, and invest in educators. He will expand proven mental health programs and limit the use of smartphones in schools. Brad will invest in CUNY – the City’s most powerful springboard to the middle class – to better prepare the next generation of New York City’s teachers, nurses, and entrepreneurs.

In the City Council, Brad invested millions in his communities’ public schools. He led the campaign that secured air-conditioning in all NYC school classrooms, after working with students on a policy report showing that 25% of classrooms did not have air conditioning. Brad led the effort to enact the School Diversity Accountability Act , requiring the Department of Education to report annually on their plan to fight student demographics and pushing the Department of Education to produce a plan to confront school segregation and improve school quality. He worked closely with parents, students, and educators to adopt a bold integration plan for the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 , in the heart of his own district as a Council Member, that is showing encouraging signs of success. A recent report from the Comptroller’s office shows how inclusive school mergers can simultaneously reduce class sizes, advance integration, and improve student outcomes. As Comptroller, Brad helped lead the successful fight against Mayor Adams when he proposed to cut the budgets of 77% of the city’s public schools – as they were still reeling from the pandemic – and against his cuts to 3K, Pre-K, and CUNY. He identified comprehensive strategies to simultaneously better serve students with disabilities while saving hundreds of millions of dollars on due process claims.

He led the campaign that secured air-conditioning in all NYC school classrooms, after working with students on a policy report showing that 25% of classrooms did not have air conditioning. Brad led the effort to enact the School Diversity Accountability Act , requiring the Department of Education to report annually on their plan to fight student demographics and pushing the Department of Education to produce a plan to confront school segregation and improve school quality. He worked closely with parents, students, and educators to adopt a bold integration plan for the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 , in the heart of his own district as a Council Member, that is showing encouraging signs of success. A recent report from the Comptroller’s office shows how inclusive school mergers can simultaneously reduce class sizes, advance integration, and improve student outcomes. As Comptroller, Brad helped lead the successful fight against Mayor Adams when he proposed to cut the budgets of 77% of the city’s public schools – as they were still reeling from the pandemic – and against his cuts to 3K, Pre-K, and CUNY. He identified comprehensive strategies to simultaneously better serve students with disabilities while saving hundreds of millions of dollars on due process claims.

Read More Blueprint for public safety Brad will reduce crime, confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Read More Stand up to Donald Trump As Donald Trump and Elon Musk threaten our neighbors and our services, Brad will bring New Yorkers together and stand up for women, the LGBTQ community, workers, our immigrant neighbors, people of color, Jews, Muslims, or any other New Yorkers subjected to hate or attack. Read More Protect reproductive rights Brad will ensure that New York remains a haven for women’s health – strengthening protections against federal threats, expanding abortion access citywide, increasing practical support for out-of-state travelers, improving emergency care, and broadening access to contraception and comprehensive sex education. Read More Fight hate and harassment Amidst a rise in hate crimes and antisemitism, Brad will adopt cutting-edge technology to identify extremist threats online and prevent violence before it starts. Read More End retail theft Brad will stop retail theft – and free items behind lock and key at drugstores – by launching a simple, one-stop platform to streamline reporting, investigating, and preventing shoplifters. Read More Prepare for the climate crisis Cleaner air. Cheaper energy. Better parks and transit. Brad will equip New York City for the ongoing climate crisis by reducing our carbon emissions, guaranteeing access to affordable clean energy, creating economic opportunities through green jobs and reliable transit, and building more resilient neighborhoods. Read More Trash the rats Brad will improve New Yorkers’ quality-of-life by solving our city’s rat problem and delivering cleaner, healthier streets for all. Unlike Eric Adams’ “Rat Czar” gimmicks and trash bin chaos, Brad’s plan is smart, scalable, and actually works for New York — prioritizing getting food waste and garbage off our streets and sidewalks. Read More Stand up for our immigrant neighbors Brad understands that immigrant New Yorkers are the economic engine of our city and will stand up for our neighbors against authoritarian attacks from the Trump administration. He will ensure immigrant New Yorkers can obtain legal services, work authorization, case management, and more. This is the most compassionate, cost-effective way to decrease NYC’s shelter population in contrast to the Adams Administration’s cruel shelter limit policies. Read More Back to top Brad’s solutions for a more affordable city Guarantee child care & afterschool for all Brad will restore Mayor Adams’ cuts to child care so that we can fulfill the promise of genuinely universal Pre-K and 3-K, then work with New Yorkers United for Child Care to expand to 2-K. He will deliver free, high-quality afterschool programming for K through 8th graders. Brad will also ensure that child care workers receive the fair pay they deserve for caring for our kids. Read More Solve the housing crisis Brad will declare a state of emergency on the housing crisis – so we can cut through red tape, build 500,000 new units of housing, protect tenants from eviction and skyrocketing rents, and increase pathways to home ownership. He’ll fix our broken housing agencies to deliver progress on the housing New Yorkers need. Read More Protect workers’ rights Brad will create a new Mayor’s Office of Workers’ Rights to coordinate the use of all of the City’s tools – contracting, concessions, legislation, franchising, economic development, tax breaks, transparency – to support and protect workers. Read More Fix NYCHA Brad will triple capital investment in the agency and directly empower tenants. Brad will leverage resident feedback through a "Yelp for NYCHA Repairs" system to strengthen property management, ensure residents have a majority vote on decisions affecting their homes, and offer multiple pathways for rehabilitation. Read More Protect health care Brad will fight to improve health care coverage, ensure low deductibles and premiums, and protect New Yorkers with preexisting conditions. He will stand up for women’s health care, reproductive freedom, and maternal health against authoritarian attacks and protect city retirees from being forced onto inferior Medicaid Advantage plans. Read More Better public transportation Brad will continue leading the fight to improve our subways and buses, reduce traffic crashes to save lives, and make our streets and neighborhoods more livable. Read More Provide world-class public education Brad will deliver universal Pre-K and 3K (alongside a “2-Care for All” program), create universal after-school programs, and invest in educators. He will expand proven mental health programs and limit the use of smartphones in schools. Brad will invest in CUNY – the City’s most powerful springboard to the middle class – to better prepare the next generation of New York City’s teachers, nurses, and entrepreneurs. Read More Strengthen NYC’s economy Brad will ensure a growing, inclusive economy where workers can thrive and where diverse entrepreneurs start and grow successful businesses with confidence. Brad will strengthen the economy by creating a "virtuous cycle," attracting people and investment, and reinvesting the revenue into vibrant public spaces and essential services – driving inclusive growth and innovation. Read More Back to top Brad’s solutions for a better-run city Make City Hall fiscally responsible Brad will grow the City’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and create a new “Protecting NYC Reserve” with billions of dollars from existing revenue sources to prepare our city Elon Musk and Donald Trump's next attack – like when they illegally stole $80 million from New Yorkers. He will monitor the City’s debt, prioritize long-term savings, and adopt fiscally responsible policies to ensure that City contractors get paid on time. Read More Attract & retain a world-class City workforce Brad will breathe life into the municipal workforce – reforming outdated civil service rules, attracting and retaining the best talent, and restoring a relationship of mutual respect between New Yorkers and their teachers, cops, and municipal employees. He’ll create a “Homes for City Workers” program that will make affordable homeownership possible for municipal workers. Read More Lead with public integrity It’s time to stop corruption in City Hall. Brad will restore trust in City Hall with comprehensive reforms to close lobbying loopholes, fight corruption in contracting, make COIB independent, increase transparency and media accessibility, and more. Read More Leverage technology to make government work Brad will modernize municipal technology (including the use of AI) to make City government work better. He will make sure City agencies utilize data more effectively to drive decisions and improve how the public accesses government services. Read More Fix NYC’s outdoor dining program Brad will fix the broken and burdensome Dining Out NYC program to ensure a vibrant future for outdoor dining. By cutting bureaucratic red tape at the Department of Transportation, he will keep our streets lively, our neighborhoods thriving, and our restaurants flourishing.

He was also an early supporter of the effort to expand opportunities for street vendors and to create the New York City ID to help immigrants get access to financial, employment, and other services. Brad helped lead the effort to establish the successful Promise NYC program , which provides child care for families seeking asylum. He passed significant legislation to support immigrant workers and communities, including laws that protect and support Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig-workers, carwasheros , fast-food workers, and vulnerable tenants facing harassment and displacement. As Comptroller, Brad has pushed for a common-sense management approach that uses City dollars more efficiently while setting new arrivals up for success. In July of 2023, Brad urged City agencies to keep prices down and improve services by replacing costly no-bid emergency contracts with vendors selected through a competitive bid process.

A constant presence on the picket line, Brad stands in solidarity with organized labor to support workers’ rights, wages, and dignity. Back to Issues Brad's Solution MORE: Brad's Record on Workers' Rights In the City Council, Brad’s “fair work week” legislation ended cruel and erratic scheduling for fast-food and retail workers, giving them advance notice of their schedules, and a pathway to full-time work. His “just cause” legislation ended arbitrary firings in the fast-food industry, and provided a model for job stability that New York City can build upon. Brad passed the first law in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber, Lyft, and other for-hire drivers, putting more than $500 million in the pockets of drivers rather than Uber and Lyft’s bank accounts – without disruption to customers or a loss of service. Brad introduced and passed the first law in the country requiring minimum pay for deliveristas working for DoorDash, Grubhub, Seamless, Uber Eats, and other food service apps – and fought successfully to preserve the law when lobbyists sought to undercut it at City Hall and quash it in the courts. Brad worked with the Freelancers Union to create and pass the “Freelance Isn’t Free Act,” which gives groundbreaking protections to independent contractors to ensure they are paid on time and in full, and hundreds of freelancers have now recovered millions of dollars they were owed. He also passed a law extending the benefits of New York City’s Human Rights Law to freelancers and independent contractors, ensuring that they are protected from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. As Comptroller and investment advisor to the five New York City pension funds, Brad has overseen a wide array of investments delivering strong returns for the City’s $270+ billion portfolio – while consistently leading efforts to ensure that companies with whom New York City invests treat their workers with dignity and respect and allow their workers to join a union without interference. His landmark shareholder proposal at Starbucks required an independent assessment of its labor practices and helped lead to a groundbreaking national agreement between the company and the union representing workers across the country. Brad rebuilt the Bureau of Labor Law and expanded the work the Comptroller’s office does on behalf of workers within New York City and around the world. He established prevailing wage rates for Staten Island Ferry workers, ending a multi-year legal dispute between hundreds of Ferry workers and New York City, leading to over $30 million dollars in backpay for those essential workers.

MORE: Brad's Record on Workers' Rights MORE: Brad's Record on Workers' Rights In the City Council, Brad’s “fair work week” legislation ended cruel and erratic scheduling for fast-food and retail workers, giving them advance notice of their schedules, and a pathway to full-time work. His “just cause” legislation ended arbitrary firings in the fast-food industry, and provided a model for job stability that New York City can build upon. Brad passed the first law in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber, Lyft, and other for-hire drivers, putting more than $500 million in the pockets of drivers rather than Uber and Lyft’s bank accounts – without disruption to customers or a loss of service. Brad introduced and passed the first law in the country requiring minimum pay for deliveristas working for DoorDash, Grubhub, Seamless, Uber Eats, and other food service apps – and fought successfully to preserve the law when lobbyists sought to undercut it at City Hall and quash it in the courts. Brad worked with the Freelancers Union to create and pass the “Freelance Isn’t Free Act,” which gives groundbreaking protections to independent contractors to ensure they are paid on time and in full, and hundreds of freelancers have now recovered millions of dollars they were owed. He also passed a law extending the benefits of New York City’s Human Rights Law to freelancers and independent contractors, ensuring that they are protected from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. As Comptroller and investment advisor to the five New York City pension funds, Brad has overseen a wide array of investments delivering strong returns for the City’s $270+ billion portfolio – while consistently leading efforts to ensure that companies with whom New York City invests treat their workers with dignity and respect and allow their workers to join a union without interference. His landmark shareholder proposal at Starbucks required an independent assessment of its labor practices and helped lead to a groundbreaking national agreement between the company and the union representing workers across the country. Brad rebuilt the Bureau of Labor Law and expanded the work the Comptroller’s office does on behalf of workers within New York City and around the world. He established prevailing wage rates for Staten Island Ferry workers, ending a multi-year legal dispute between hundreds of Ferry workers and New York City, leading to over $30 million dollars in backpay for those essential workers. He has also recovered more than $8 million in back wages and civil penalties for New York City’s prevailing wage workers including construction workers, temp workers, building service workers, and security officers.

He will confront the staffing crisis at the NYPD, guide the NYPD to focus on solving gun crimes, and keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner. He’ll restore trust and accountability by combatting hate crimes and violence and investing in community partnerships and safe neighborhoods. Back to Issues Brad's Solution MORE: Brad's Record on Public Safety At the height of the discriminatory use of stop-and-frisk, Brad spearheaded legislation at the City Council along with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams to strengthen the City’s prohibition on racial profiling and create the office of the NYPD Inspector General. What followed were dramatic declines in discriminatory stop-and-frisk, accompanied by dramatic declines in crime. Additionally while in the Council, Brad sponsored a resolution in favor of pending legislation within the New York State Legislature to enact extensive gun control laws including waiting periods, background checks, and safety certificates. As Comptroller, Brad’s hard-hitting audits and reports have exposed the failures of Mayor Adams’ approach to public safety, like sweeps of homeless encampments that place just 0.1% of people into permanent housing. Brad’s audit of ShotSpotter , a gunfire location and detection technology contracted by the NYPD, revealed that alerts only identified confirmed shootings 13% of the time. As a trustee of the Police Pension Fund, Brad worked alongside union representatives to protect retirement security and ensure disability decisions were handled with integrity and consistency. Brad partnered with police unions to secure disability benefits for officers who contracted long Covid. He also fought to ensure that the family of Officer Adeed Fayaz, who was killed in the line of duty, received the death benefits they deserved. Brad led the pension systems to call on American Express, MasterCard and Visa to support a proposal to establish a merchant category code (MCC) for gun and ammunition stores. The MCC code would allow financial institutions to both locate and report large purchases of firearms and ammunition – purchases that have the potential to be used for criminal purchases.
