His borough presidency is historic in more ways than one. He is the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. Safe and Joyful Pregnancies for Brooklyn Moms After taking office, BP Reynoso set his sights on addressing the maternal health crisis devastating new families in Brooklyn. He vowed to do what he could to close the disparities leading to Black women being 8 times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than their white counterparts. In his first year as Borough President, he allocated the entirety of his Fiscal Year 2023 capital budget – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals to create new and state-of-the-art maternal health facilities. This marked the first time a Borough President has ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. A Plan for a Healthy and Housed Brooklyn In his second year as Borough President, Antonio released his Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the first borough-specific, large-scale planning effort ever in NYC and a model for planning citywide. The Plan identifies patterns across Brooklyn and shows us what each neighborhood needs and what each neighborhood can give to ensure all New Yorkers are healthy, housed, and supported. For example, while one community district in Brooklyn created 12,000 new units of affordable housing over a ten-year span, another added only 7. A Pivot to Celebrating Through Service As New Yorkers began to face more and more struggles in their everyday life, BP Reynoso decided to do something unprecedented: pivot away from the cultural celebrations famous of Borough Presidents’ past and rededicate the office’s resources toward celebrating Brooklyn through service . He’s hosted deed theft prevention workshops, NYC Rent Freeze Program enrollment clinics, shelter animal adoption drives, one-on-one consultations to help homeowners get their DOB summonses corrected, and more. He even converted the Community Room at Borough Hall, a place once known for parties and food, into a satellite Asylum Application Help Center to help undocumented immigrants apply for work authorization. Since its start in March 2024, the site has completed over 5,000 work authorizations. Watch Borough President Antonio Reynoso’s 2022 inauguration.

The disparity is staggering – and for Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, it’s personal. He learned just how bad things were when he was a council member and his wife, Iliana, was pregnant with their first child, Alejandro. The two were visiting Woodhull Hospital for a doctor’s appointment when their midwife Ms. Helena Grant sat them down to explain the heightened risks and complications Iliana faced as an Afro-Caribbean woman. As Ms. Grant explained the many reasons why Black and Brown women face such disastrous outcomes – from the ongoing legacies of slavery to disinvested health care and medical racism – one thing became clear: the maternal health crisis could not be solved by tinkering around the margins. So, Borough President Reynoso made a promise to Brooklyn. He committed to do whatever he could to make the borough the safest place in the city to have a baby. As he took his seat in Borough Hall, he quickly got to work. In his first year, Reynoso assembled a Maternal Health Task Force, invested the entirety of his FY2023 capital funding – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals for maternal healthcare improvements, and launched initiatives like his Born in Brooklyn Baby Boxes and Healthy Pregnancy Resource Guide to equip new and expecting parents with the information and tools they need to stay safe and healthy. Every year, Borough President Reynoso is building on his commitment and pursuing new and bold pathways toward safe pregnancies in Brooklyn. Learn more about the Borough President’s efforts to improve maternal health and access resources and information by navigating the sections below. Maternal Health Timeline April 2022 Maternal Health Task Force In April 2022, BP Reynoso formed his Maternal Health Task Force of eight Black women OBGYNs, nurses, midwives, mental health advocates, nonprofit leaders and other community leaders to guide efforts to improve pregnancy outcomes for Black and Brown people in Brooklyn. The Task Force is led by Dr. Wendy Wilcox (Co-Chair), Chief Women’s Health Service Officer at Health + Hospitals, and Helena Grant (Co-Chair), Senior Advisor of Midwifery Initiatives for DOHMH. Summer 2022 $45M for Public Hospitals Over the 2022 summer, BP Reynoso allocated the entirety of his FY2023 capital funding – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals for maternal healthcare improvements. This marked the first time a Borough President has ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County received $15.625M to renovate the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) and mother-baby units. NYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health received $18.5M to renovate the outpatient care center, labor and delivery rooms, post-partum recovery rooms, and NICU. NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull received $11M to build a state-of-the-art birthing center. November 2022 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ Baby Boxes In November 2022, a total of 500 post-partum families receiving care at select Brooklyn hospitals and clinics received “Born in Brooklyn” baby boxes with free baby supplies and post-partum resources for new parents through a $100,000 grant from the BP’s office to Met Council. November 2022 ‘Healthy Pregnancy’ Public Education Campaign In the fall of 2022, BP Reynoso launched a $250,000 multimedia public education campaign connecting Brooklynites with a resource guide for a healthy pregnancy informed by the Borough President’s Maternal Health Taskforce. The multicultural campaign included English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole informational ads in bus and train stations in key Brooklyn neighborhoods and across digital platforms. Check the Borough President’s Healthy Pregnancy Guide . July 2023 Maternal Health Expo In July 2023, BP Reynoso welcomed over a hundred new and expecting parents to Brooklyn Borough Hall for a ‘Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies’ maternal health expo. The afternoon-long event included: Workshops on prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding, safe sleep, and rights like parental leave and health insurance; Mommy and Me yoga and belly dancing classes; Resources and information from 20+ agencies and community organizations; A Pack-n-Play raffle. Summer 2023 Over $1M for Brookdale BP Reynoso allocated $1,045,000 in FY24 capital dollars to renovate and modernize the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Brookdale Hospital. Brookdale is a safety-net hospital that provides comprehensive healthcare services to underserved communities in central and northeast Brooklyn. April 2024 Brooklyn Community Baby Shower In April 2024, BP Reynoso hosted a ‘Brooklyn Community Baby Shower’ for 100 new and expecting mothers. The day-long celebration took place at NYCHA’s Van Dyke Community Center in Brownsville and included: Over a dozen organizations tabling with resources and information; Workshops on safe sleep and postpartum mental health; Games, arts & crafts, and contests; And of course, gifts! Attendees left with diaper bags full of diapers, baby wipes, baby blankets, postpartum pads, and baby books, as well as a supply box containing a baby bottle, cocoa butter, additional baby wipes, and more. August 2024 Community Baby Shower Fund In August 2024, BP Reynoso announced a $50,000 ‘Community Baby Shower Fund’ to provide matching funds of up to $5,000 to Brooklyn nonprofits hosting community baby showers in neighborhoods with high maternal mortality and morbidity rates. Learn how to apply to the Borough President’s Community Baby Shower Fund . April 2025 Perinatal Mental Health Certificate In April 2025, BP Reynoso and Brooklyn College announced New York State’s first credit-bearing Advanced Certificate in Perinatal Mental Health. The curriculum, which was developed in collaboration with the BP’s Maternal Health Task Force, will prepare healthcare, mental health, early intervention, and early educational professionals to support pregnant mothers experiencing mental health conditions – New York City’s leading cause of pregnancy-associated deaths. The program is piloting two courses in spring 2025 and will host its first full cohort in fall 2025. Healthy Pregnancy Guide Check out Borough President Reynoso’s Guide to a Safe & Healthy Pregnancy. The guide is full of information for new and expecting parents and ways to get connected to pregnancy and baby resources. Community Baby Shower Fund Want to throw a community baby shower to help the new and expecting parents in your neighborhood? Borough President Reynoso wants to help! The Borough President’s Community Baby Shower Fund offers Brooklyn nonprofits the opportunity to request up to $5,000 in reimbursed funding from the Community Baby Shower Fund for non-personnel expenses. No Brooklynite should have to experience the joys and anxieties of pregnancy and parenthood alone, and community baby showers offer a powerful venue for neighbors to come together in celebration and in support of one another.

Antonio Reynoso is Brooklyn’s 20th Borough President. The son of two Dominican immigrants, Antonio was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, just three blocks down from where he lives today with his wife and two sons. He grew up in Section 8 housing, relying on food stamps for family meals and scholarships for education opportunities. He experienced firsthand how a little help can go a long way for a young family trying their hardest to put down roots and have a fair shot at the life they want. In 2021, Antonio became the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. Since then, he’s launched a history-making maternal health agenda and championed planning for a healthy, housed Brooklyn.

Borough President Reynoso Every year, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso has the opportunity to fund local institutions and organizations doing the work of serving Brooklyn. Learn more about the funding opportunities and which application might be right for you. Have questions? Contact our budget team by emailing [email protected] [email protected]             Discretionary Expense Funding The Office of the Brooklyn Borough President’s discretionary expense funding can be distributed to support the programming, services, and events of nonprofits that directly support the borough of Brooklyn and its residents. How to Apply for Discretionary Expense Funding All nonprofit organizations seeking discretionary expense funding for projects must complete: Capital Funding The New York City Charter allows all five Borough Presidents to allocate capital funding to qualified projects on an annual basis as part of the City’s budget process. These funds are used to make improvements across the borough by creating and improving infrastructure. Capital funding can be allocated to improve academic institutions, affordable housing development, community centers, cultural organizations, economic development, hospitals, libraries, parks, streetscapes, and many more features of our borough. The New York City Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues guidelines that restrict the types of projects to which capital funding can be allocated, as well as the types of organizations to which capital funding can be allocated. While Borough Presidents often invest these funds in improvements to City-owned assets, we also make these funds available to nonprofit organizations for capital projects that serve a defined City purpose. In these instances, both the organization that receives capital funding and the project to which the capital funding is appropriated must be deemed eligible by the New York City Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These projects are called “Non-City Projects.” How to Apply for Capital Funding The Borough President’s capital funding application opens January each year and typically closes in February. Applications for FY26 are now closed. About Non-City Projects Types of Non-City Projects Non-City projects generally fall into several categories. It is important to note that a specific project may fall into multiple categories, and thus necessitate multiple applications: Real Property Property acquisition Construction of new buildings or reconstruction / renovation of existing buildings Property acquisition Construction of new buildings or reconstruction / renovation of existing buildings Moveable Property Purchase of equipment or furniture that is not attached or is minimally attached to real property Procurement of vehicles Initial outfitting of a newly occupied or recently renovated facility Purchase of equipment or furniture that is not attached or is minimally attached to real property Procurement of vehicles Initial outfitting of a newly occupied or recently renovated facility Affordable Housing Construction or improvements to housing facilities that utilize a housing loan program of New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) Construction or improvements to housing facilities that utilize a housing loan program of New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) Cultural Projects Projects implemented by organizations that receive funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) Projects implemented by organizations that receive funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) Qualifying Organizations For an organization to be eligible for capital funding, that organization must – at a minimum – generally meet the following requirements. Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of eligibility requirements. Interested applicants should refer to the NYC Capital Grants website . The organization must be a nonprofit organized under New York State law or registered to do business in New York State. The organization must have an operating history of at least three years and must be able to provide audited financial statements for the immediately preceding three fiscal years. The organization must have paid full-time staff. The organization must demonstrate an operating budget to support the proposed project on an ongoing basis. The organization must have an established history of receiving operating funds from the City of New York. In the event the organization is applying for capital funding for a Real Property project, the organization must have operating contracts with the City totaling $50,000 or more for the City’s current fiscal year, as well as the preceding two fiscal years. In the event the organization is applying for capital funding for a Moveable Property project, the organization must have operating contracts with the City totaling $25,000 or more for the City’s current fiscal year. In the event the organization is applying for capital funding for a Real Property project, the organization must have operating contracts with the City totaling $50,000 or more for the City’s current fiscal year, as well as the preceding two fiscal years. In the event the organization is applying for capital funding for a Moveable Property project, the organization must have operating contracts with the City totaling $25,000 or more for the City’s current fiscal year. Certain organizational eligibility requirements may be waived in certain instances if: the applicant organization is a hospital or health clinic; the applicant is an organization that receives operating funding from DCLA, or if the project is an otherwise qualified affordable housing project. Qualifying Projects For a project to be eligible for capital funding, that project must – at a minimum – generally meet the following requirements. Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of eligibility requirements. Interested applicants should refer to the NYC Capital Grants website . For all Non-City Projects: The project must be for a capital asset under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and City rules. The project must be used for Front Line Services. Front Line Services are services that are rendered directly to the public through physical public access or through telephonic communication. The project must be used for Front Line Services. Front Line Services are services that are rendered directly to the public through physical public access or through telephonic communication. For Non-City Projects involving Moveable Property: If the project includes items that are not attached to real property, each item or equipment system must have a minimum City contribution of at least $50,000, unless it is for Initial Outfitting of new space. If the project includes items that have a minor degree of attachment to real property, each item or equipment system must have a minimum City contribution of at least $250,000. For Non-City Projects involving Real Property: The project must have a minimum capital contribution from the city of $500,000. The City contribution may not exceed 90 percent of the portion of funding of a Real Property project up to $2 million and 50 percent of the portion of funding in excess thereof. Of the remaining amount of funding needed to fully finance the project (the non-City contribution) the lesser of 50 percent or $1 millions of funds for the project must be in hand at the time of the application for City funding in the form of cash, pledged funds, or commitment letters from lenders willing to accept a subordinate position. If the project involves improvements to existing property, the applicant organization must own the property that is to be improved. Non-City Project Application Process Before beginning the capital application process, applicant organizations are encouraged to contact capital staff at the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President to discuss their project proposal. Assuming that both the applicant organization and its proposed project are eligible, the following bullet points detail how organizations should proceed to apply for capital funding, and how the capital funding process works. Organizations should begin the capital process by developing a project scope. Specifically, applicants need to know what it is they will be asking the Brooklyn Borough President to fund. Once a project scope is determined, the organization must obtain detailed quotes or estimates related to their project. After a project scope has been developed and estimates obtained, two separate applications must be submitted: An application must be submitted directly to the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President via the Brooklyn Borough President’s online capital funding application. This online funding application is generally available the first week of January. The application deadline typically falls during the third week of February. Additionally, an application must also be submitted via the CapGrants portal . Note that the application process is slightly different for organizations that receive capital funding from DCLA. This online funding application is generally available the first week of January. The application deadline typically falls during the last week of February. An application must be submitted directly to the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President via the Brooklyn Borough President’s online capital funding application. This online funding application is generally available the first week of January. The application deadline typically falls during the third week of February. Additionally, an application must also be submitted via the CapGrants portal . Note that the application process is slightly different for organizations that receive capital funding from DCLA. This online funding application is generally available the first week of January. The application deadline typically falls during the last week of February. Once both capital applications are submitted, capital staff may reach out to the applicant organization to clarify information or obtain additional information if needed. These requests will be submitted via the CapGrants portal . If the capital application is satisfactory and complete, applicant organizations will not be contacted until funding decisions are released, following the adoption of the New York City budget at the end of June. Notifications are generally sent out to all applicants within a month of the City budget being passed. Within 3 – 6 months after the passage of the New York City budget, the applicable managing agency will contact capital applicants to begin development of a contract, referred to as a Funding Agreement. Once a Funding Agreement is created and approved by the respective managing agency staff, OMB must review and approve the Funding Agreement, and then issue a Certificate to Proceed. Once a Certificate to Proceed has been issued and all necessary approval obtained, the Funding Agreement can be executed between the City and the recipient organization and sent to the City Comptroller for registration. The typical lifespan of a capital project varies greatly, and can range from 12-36 months from the date of the appropriation of funds It is extremely important to note that capital funding for Non-City Projects is made available on a reimbursement basis only. Any purchases made prior to such registration are made at the organization’s risk. The City is under no obligation to reimburse an organization for purchases made prior to the registration of the Funding Agreement if such Funding Agreement is not ultimately registered or if such purchases do not comply with the terms of the Funding Agreement.

Specifically, applicants need to know what it is they will be asking the Brooklyn Borough President to fund. Once a project scope is determined, a school must determine how much funding it will need to complete the project. To obtain an accurate estimate, the school’s principal should contact the New York City School Construction Authority (SCA) for a general quote. To obtain such a quote, please contact one of the following SCA representatives: Jonathan Seltzer – [email protected] Bryan McGinn – [email protected] Jonathan Seltzer – [email protected] [email protected] Bryan McGinn – [email protected] [email protected] After the school’s principal has obtained a general quote from the SCA, an application should be submitted to the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President via the online capital funding application. The online funding application is generally available the first week of January on our website (brooklynbp.nyc.gov). The application deadline typically falls during the third week of February. Once a capital application is submitted, capital staff may reach out to the applicant to clarify information or obtain additional information if needed. If the capital application is satisfactory and complete, schools will not be contacted until funding decisions are released following the passage of the New York City budget by the City Council at the end of June. Notifications are generally sent out to all applicants within a month of the City budget being passed. Within six months after the passage of the New York City budget, the SCA will reach out to all principals to begin project planning. Watch: Office of BP Reynoso Hosts FY25 Capital Public Schools Information Session, Dec. 12, 2023 Nonprofit Acquisition Fund Nonprofits are the lifeboats of so many neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn, doing the work day in and day out to help people live just a little bit better. Yet so many of our nonprofits spend time and money on ensuring that they have a base of operations for their work – time and money that could be going to service delivery if they owned their spaces. To help Brooklyn’s nonprofits, Borough President Reynoso has committed to using portions of his capital budget to assist Brooklyn nonprofits in purchasing permanent spaces. Nonprofits requesting assistance for acquiring permanent spaces can do so by submitting an application for capital funding for non-City projects. Find more information on capital funding and non-City projects in the section above.

The campaign includes English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole ads at select Brooklyn bus stops, urban panels at subway stations, and digital ads on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube that lead people to an online resource guide. The ads at bus shelters and subway stations can be found in the primarily Black, Brown, Caribbean, and Latino communities where the highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity have been reported, including Bed-Stuy, Brownsville, Bushwick, Canarsie, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, East New York, Flatbush, and Williamsburg. Entirely guided by the Borough President’s Maternal Health Taskforce, the campaign is his latest in a string of maternal health announcements aimed at making Brooklyn the safest place in New York City to have a baby as a Black or Brown person. One-third of pregnancy-related deaths in New York City are residents of Brooklyn, with the ratio on average 9.4 times higher for Black mothers compared to their white counterparts and the crisis in maternal health most acute among Haitian women. Borough President Reynoso’s $250,000 maternal health public education campaign was designed with this in mind. “Every day, we’re making this borough a little bit safer for Brooklynites dreaming of growing their families,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. “To truly end the maternal mortality crisis facing our Black and Brown mothers will take long-term and large-scale structural change – like our upcoming renovations to the maternal healthcare facilities at our public hospitals – but in the meantime, there are steps we can take right now to empower our expecting parents through their pregnancy journey. I’m so grateful to my Maternal Health Taskforce for their incredible expertise as we take yet another step toward saving lives and making Brooklyn the safest place for someone to have a baby.” “It’s far past time that we do right by every parent and child, no matter the color of their skin or the language they speak,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams . “The numbers are clear: Black women are nine times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than white women in New York City. Borough President Reynoso has relentlessly fought these maternal health disparities and is a tireless partner working to make New York City the safest place to start a family. Today’s announcement is a game-changer as we address this crisis and ensures expecting families have the tools, information, and support they need for a healthy pregnancy.” The campaign’s resource guide, found at brooklynbpstg.wpengine.com/healthypregnancy and translated into multiple languages, approaches pregnancy through five pillars aimed at empowering individuals to advocate for more supportive care before, during, and after pregnancy that has the ability to improve maternal health outcomes. The pillars include: Prepare for a Safe & Healthy Pregnancy Take Care of Your Emotional Well-Being Build Your Pregnancy Care Team Be Your Own Health Advocate Navigate Your Postpartum Journey The information in the healthy pregnancy resource guide includes everything from nutritional guidance, emotional wellness plans, and a person’s legal rights as a patient in New York State, to resources for accessing health insurance, midwifery support, and doula services. The website offers support for people preparing for pregnancy, during pregnancy, and in the year following – when the majority of pregnancy-related deaths occur. The guide was assembled with the expertise of the Borough President’s Maternal Health Taskforce, which is comprised of Black women who work in various spaces of maternal health, from midwifery, obstetrics, mental health, advocacy, and more. The online resource guide was also distilled for pamphlets that will be distributed to community health clinics and hospital maternal health practices throughout Brooklyn communities where the campaign is live. The pamphlet will be carried in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, with a total of 50,000 units being distributed across health spaces in Brooklyn. The creative and ad coordination was led by NYC-based public relations and marketing firm BerlinRosen through an RFP process. During his campaign, Borough President Reynoso highlighted the gross inequity in maternal deaths and complications between Black and Brown birthing people and their white counterparts. As Borough President, he pledged to reduce this disparity in Brooklyn and make the borough the safest place to have a baby in the city by the end of his administration. In April 2022, Borough President Reynoso launched his Maternal Health Taskforce to begin developing and executing his maternal health agenda, and by July 2022, the Borough President had allocated his entire $45M FY23 capital budget toward maternal health care improvements at the three Brooklyn public hospitals: NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County : $15.625M to renovate the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) and mother-baby units; NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island : $18.5M to renovate the outpatient care center, labor and delivery rooms, post-partum recovery rooms, and NICU; and NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull : $11M to build a state-of-the-art birthing center. Borough President Reynoso is the first Borough President to allocate an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. Just two weeks ago, Borough President Reynoso further advanced his historic maternal health efforts with the pilot of “Born in Brooklyn” baby boxes, which contain free baby supplies and post-partum resources for new parents. Made possible by a $100,000 grant from the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President to Met Council, America’s largest Jewish charity, a total of 500 post-partum families receiving care at select Brooklyn hospitals and clinics will receive the boxes. QUOTES FROM BOROUGH PRESIDENT REYNOSO’S MATERNAL HEALTH TASKFORCE “The Brooklyn Borough President and the Maternal Health Taskforce believe that knowledge is power!” said Helena Grant, Co-chair of Borough President Antonio Reynoso’s Maternal Health Taskforce and Director of Midwifery Services at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull. “We are proud to offer information that honors the principles of multiculturalism while also centering communities most affected by maternal mortality and morbidity in the borough of Brooklyn. We are hopeful that this is another step in creating the change women, birthing people, families, and communities most certainly deserve.” “I am delighted that the Borough president is leading the way on centering the needs of Black and Latino women and birthing persons in Brooklyn. This campaign makes a myriad of resources readily available to the families and communities we serve. Together, we have the capacity to eliminate birth inequities in NYC in our lifetime, by addressing structural racism and countering disinvestment. I remain hopeful and grateful for the opportunity to serve on this taskforce, at this time, in the borough of Brooklyn,” said Dr. Zahirah McNatt, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . “This educational campaign is a perfect example why I joined Borough President Reynoso’s maternal health taskforce. I am honored to be a part of this working group, creating community information and awareness to help our pregnant persons and new mothers to connect to services and resources they need,” said Executive Director at Brooklyn Perinatal Network, Inc. Ngozi Moses . QUOTES FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS “The unfair truth is that Black and Brown women face a higher mortality rate during pregnancy and childbirth than any other racial group across New York City,” said Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez. “Too often, systemic barriers make it more difficult for women to access the maternal health resources they deserve I applaud Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso for investing in this new multicultural, multilingual maternal health public education campaign to ensure women have the information they need to have a safe pregnancy.” “Though pregnancy can be a precious and blessed experience for expecting mothers, and though our modern society has achieved impossible breakthroughs in the field of maternal health, far too many pregnant people across our nation and our city continue to face terrible risks throughout their term. For Black and Brown communities, in particular, devastating maternal health rates are as common as they are avoidable. But we are fortunate to know Brooklyn is on a better path, today. Borough President Reynoso’s new public education campaign will deliver resources and information meaningful enough to not only change lives, but save them. I thank him for his work and commitment towards securing a better future for maternal health in Brooklyn, and I look forward to working at his side in this critical space for years to come,” said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke “As a Black woman and as a mom, I take the issue of maternal health quite seriously. I have for years screamed from the mountain tops about the need to improve maternal outcomes – especially for Black women,” said Assemblywoman Latrice Walker. “The city released a report late last year that revealed in stunning detail what many of us have known for a long time. Black women are eight times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women in New York City. Maternal outcomes are also alarmingly perilous among Hispanic and Haitian women.  A separate report from a few years ago showed that the highest rates of Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) were in Brownsville, East Flatbush and East New York. I represent parts of each of those communities. I applaud Borough President Antonio Reynoso for educating the public and for arming people with information that could save lives.” “I am once again delighted to commend Borough President Reynoso for his commitment to ensuring healthy pregnancies for all,” said Council Member and Chair of NYC Council Committee on Hospitals Mercedes Narcisse. “ With Haitian women facing the highest risks during pregnancy, I am particularly pleased that the educational campaign will include ads in Kreyol to help reach this vulnerable population. This is the type of impactful solution our borough needs to reduce the maternal health inequities faced by so many Brooklynites on a daily basis.” “I’m thrilled to see Borough President Reynoso continue his work to make Brooklyn the safest place to have a baby. The challenges of delivering safely as a Black or brown woman are not abstract for these communities, and sadly too many birthing people have experienced health complications or loss as a result of deep racial inequities in our healthcare system,” said Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez. “Directly connecting pregnant people to educational resources and information is critical in empowering them to make the best choices for their health, their babies, and their families.” “Maternal health issues are reaching crisis levels for Brooklyn’s Black and brown communities,” said Council Member Sandy Nurse. “It’s crucial that we offer culturally and linguistically competent information and resources to pregnant people in our communities. I applaud Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso’s commitment to making Brooklyn the safest place in NYC to have a baby, and his investment in this public education campaign.” ### , • OFFICE: Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201 PHONE: (718) 802 – 3700 EMAIL: [email protected] Instagram Instagram X X Bluesky Bluesky Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso © 2025 | Brooklyn Borough President  ABOUT BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility CALENDAR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MATERNAL HEALTH NEWSROOM Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 DEPARTMENTS Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography CONNECT Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr YouTube LinkedIn Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Twitter Twitter Flickr Flickr YouTube YouTube LinkedIn LinkedIn

This funding will allow the South Brooklyn hospital to improve the continuity of care between inpatient and outpatient services, which will lead to better patient outcomes. NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island is receiving the largest allocation from Borough President Reynoso’s FY23 capital funding at $18.5M, with the entire $45M budget being allotted across the three public hospitals in Brooklyn to help improve maternal health care services that will in turn reduce maternal mortality rates of Black pregnant people. Mr. Reynoso is the first Borough President to allocate an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. “It’s important for me to ensure that every corner of Brooklyn is given an equitable amount of attention and resources when trying to build a more sustainable, safer, livable future in this borough. Being able to invest a substantial amount of funds across our three Brooklyn public hospitals will help upgrade services throughout the borough, including in South Brooklyn where NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island stands,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso . “I thank our city’s public healthcare system for being a trusted partner in my efforts to close maternal mortality rates among Black pregnant people.” “Brooklyn is the fastest growing borough in New York City and it has the second-highest birth rate. NYC Health + Hospitals applauds Borough President Antonio Reynoso for his vision to make Brooklyn one of the safest places to give birth,” said NYC Health + Hospitals President and CEO Mitchell Katz, MD . “While racial disparities in birth outcomes are evident nationwide, our health care system is committed to reducing and eliminating these inequalities by creating safer birth experiences for New Yorkers. The borough president’s investment in our patients and their families will help us further improve maternal health outcomes. We thank Mr. Reynoso for his tremendous partnership and generosity, and we are most grateful for his gift.” “The Borough President’s generous infusion of capital funding will help complete a multi-year master plan for the future NYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health and its Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospital. Provision of equitable and state-of-the-art women’s health care services to the residents of South Brooklyn and neighboring communities is a cornerstone in the hospital’s clinical strategy,” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island CEO Svetlana Lipyanskaya. “ It is inconceivable that Black women are eight times more likely to die from complications during birth in New York City. I wholeheartedly support the Borough President’s goal of addressing the maternal mortality disparity between women of color and their white counterparts and making Brooklyn the safest borough in NYC to give birth.” Capital funding will go towards creating a contiguous comprehensive women’s health service on the eight floor of the Main and Tower buildings.  Services from outpatient care to labor and delivery to post-partum recovery will be brought together to ensure care continuity and safety.    Patient rooms and ancillary space will be upgraded to enhanced total family care. Additionally, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and nursery will be redesigned to accommodate the needs of families to reflect the hospital’s Baby-Friendly designation. After the redesign of the hospital’s Mother-Baby Unit, all women’s health providers, staff and patient support spaces, and education facilities will be on the same floor, allowing for an immediate response in case of an emergency and promoting a dialogue between team members to ensure timely consultation when questions arise.  Furthermore, the co-location of services will allow expecting patients and their families to become familiar with the team and amenities, thus increasing comfort and decreasing anxiety. “On behalf of the entire OB/GYN Department, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Borough President Reynoso for his commitment to improving women’s health care for South Brooklyn residents, said Dr. Maggie Tetrokalashvili, Chair of OB/GYN at Coney Island Hospital. His support will enable us to make a positive impact in the lives of patients we serve, to give every mother, every baby and every woman a sense of belonging, and hope for a brighter future.” “NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island’s investment in improving women’s health care services is an important milestone in meeting the health care needs of the residents of South Brooklyn and its neighboring communities. I applaud Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso’s commitment to improving the health and well-being of the patients who seek care at New York City’s public health system” said Theresa Scavo, Chair of NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island Community Advisory Board. During his campaign, Borough President Reynoso highlighted the gross inequity that Black pregnant people are 9.4 times more likely to die due to childbirth complications than their white counterparts. He pledged to reduce this disparity in Brooklyn, making the borough one of the safest places to have a baby in the country. Borough President Reynoso began working on this priority quickly after transitioning to his new role, launching his administration’s Maternal Health Taskforce in April 2022. The taskforce will help lay the foundation for strategizing around his maternal health agenda and expanding the taskforce. In addition to his capital allocations, Borough President Reynoso also looks forward to supporting outpatient services, such as social services and community care models, that address underlying issues faced by people of color, increasing health insurance access for all birthing people, and more. “It is once again my pleasure to stand with Borough President Antonio Reynoso as he leads the way in addressing the vast disparities in maternal health and mortality and helps to create more equitable maternal health care services in our borough. Borough President Reynoso’s $18.5 million allocation of capital funding to Coney Island Hospital will certainly help so many soon-to-be mothers of color receive the care they need and deserve. As a mother of four, a registered nurse, and Chair of the Council’s Committee on Hospitals, I commend and thank Borough President Reynoso for his bold leadership and commitment to this issue,” said Councilmember and Chair of the City Council Committee on Hospitals Mercedes Narcisse . “This funding allocation by Borough President Reynoso to NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island will potentially improve the health and well-being of many thousands of women in southern Brooklyn for generations to come,” said Assemblymember Steven Cymbrowitz . “This is welcomed news as we continue working to address alarming disparities in women’s health care/maternal health and to ensure that all women have access to high-quality and accessible medical options.” “As a longtime resident of Coney Island, I am thrilled and grateful for the Brooklyn Borough President’s generous allocation of $18.5 million in capital funding to expand women’s health services at Coney Island Hospital. This investment in our southern Brooklyn community will benefit so many women from all walks of life who depend on the hospital for maternal health care. The significance of this grant in improving the quality of care that women receive cannot be overstated,” said Assemblymember Mathylde Frontus . “I am immensely grateful to Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso for allocating $18.5 million in capital funding to NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island. This crucial funding will help this major Southern Brooklyn hospital to expand access to women’s health services and to improve the quality of medical care for countless patients. Back in February of this year, during our meeting in Borough Hall, I advocated for additional capital funding to Coney Island Hospital maternity ward, given its huge importance for all Southern Brooklyn communities. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso have exceeded our expectations and secured even bigger capital funding that it was anticipated. He recognized the need for these vital services for women and their families. This allocation will save many lives. I am proud to join Borough President Reynoso at this historic announcement,” said Councilmember Ari Kagan . “Thanks, Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso, for this capital funding allocation, and for his commitment to the health of Brooklyn residents, and Coney Island Hospital CEO Svetlana Lipyanskaya for her hard work on this. I look forward to the opening of this Integrated Women’s Health Services on the campus,” said Councilmember Inna Vernikov . Last week, Borough President Reynoso announced a capital allocation of $11M to NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull to improve the hospital’s women’s health services by creating a state-of-the-art birthing center. ### , • OFFICE: Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201 PHONE: (718) 802 – 3700 EMAIL: [email protected] Instagram Instagram X X Bluesky Bluesky Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso © 2025 | Brooklyn Borough President  ABOUT BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility CALENDAR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MATERNAL HEALTH NEWSROOM Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 DEPARTMENTS Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography CONNECT Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr YouTube LinkedIn Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Twitter Twitter Flickr Flickr YouTube YouTube LinkedIn LinkedIn

Borough President Reynoso also previewed four new initiatives his Administration would be pursuing in 2023: funding for nonprofits to purchase permanent space; a solarization project for low-income tenants; a small business incubator for entrepreneurs in Brownsville; and a community board reform effort. “In 2022, Borough Hall made history and set a new standard for big, bold action on behalf of the people of Brooklyn. In my second year, I’m not going to stop until we outdo our first,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso . “I’m not here to do a thousand things halfway, I’m here to do the five or six or seven things that will make a real difference in people’s lives. Brooklyn needs major changes, and I’m going to do right by my people. This role isn’t just ceremonial, we’re going to prove what we can do and show Brooklyn the difference a Borough President can make.” Borough President Antonio Reynoso announced four major steps his administration will take to advance a Brooklyn for all: Permanent Homes for Nonprofits The Borough President will allocate a portion of his capital budget toward assisting Brooklyn nonprofits in purchasing permanent spaces, so that they can spend less time negotiating with landlords and more time serving our neighbors. The initiative will create jobs, boost ownership, and ensure the organizations that are lifeboats for our neighborhoods can focus on service delivery and advancing their missions. Saving Through Solarization Borough President Reynoso undertook a solarization project to alleviate monthly utility costs for low-income tenants and encourage Brooklyn’s transition to renewable energy. According to a 2019 report by the Mayor’s Office, 32 percent of Brooklyn families in 2017 were “utility burdened,” spending more than 6 percent of their income on utilities – and this was before costs went up about 11 to 12 percent per year in the last 3 years. Kickstarting Business in Brownsville The Borough President announced an effort to incubate businesses in Brownsville, create economic opportunity for entrepreneurs, revitalize local retail, and improve the range of amenities in the historic neighborhood. Community Board Reform Borough President Reynoso’s vision of a Brooklyn built for and by the people requires that community boards – the grassroots of our local government – are fully funded, fully resourced, and as diverse as the people of this borough. Changes to the City Charter and decades of under-resourcing, however, have made it impossible for Brooklyn’s 18 community boards to deliver on their charter-mandated responsibilities and advocate for the needs of their community district. As agency head, Borough President Reynoso issued guidance to facilitate community boards’ access to the funding and resources they need to effectively perform their charter-mandated functions. This new guidance will interpret and bring clarity to the 1989 City Charter that failed to properly outline how the responsibility for supporting community boards would be divided between Borough Hall and Mayoral agencies. This effort will formalize channels for community boards to acquire resources, funding, and services, ensuring our City agencies step up for our community boards so they can truly fulfill their role as our most grassroots level of government.

Taskforce fulfills Borough President Reynoso’s commitment to reduce disparities of maternal mortality and morbidity found between birthing people of color and their white counterparts    BROOKLYN, NY (April 11, 2022) Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso today announced the appointment of the initial members to his Maternal Health Taskforce. Co-chaired by NYC Health + Hospitals Chief Women’s Health Service Officer Dr. Wendy Wilcox and NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull Director of Midwifery Services Helena Grant, additional members of the taskforce include former NYC Councilmember Hon. Una S. T. Clarke, Assistant Commissioner of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Dr. Zahirah McNatt, Executive Director at Brooklyn Perinatal Network, Inc. Ngozi Moses, and mental health advocate Christina Sparrock.  In its first phase, Borough President Reynoso’s taskforce will help lay the foundation for strategizing around his maternal health agenda and expanding the taskforce. The Maternal Health Taskforce fulfills Borough President Reynoso’s commitment to reduce disparities of maternal mortality and morbidity found between birthing people of color and their white counterparts. Currently, Black birthing people in New York City are 9.4 times more likely to die due to childbirth complications than their white counterparts.  “The initial members of our Maternal Health Taskforce bring decades of expertise in maternal healthcare, wraparound services, community engagement, advocacy, and other spaces that are needed to holistically approach the crisis of maternal mortality disparities seen in our communities,” said Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso . “I look forward to working with these experts and literally saving lives.”  In his new position, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso intends to allocate a majority of his FY23 Capital Funding to the three Brooklyn public hospitals to upgrade birthing facilities at each, including but not limited to utilizing state-of-the-art technology to improve patient safety, expanding birthing options, providing new opportunities for patient education, improving continuity of care, and prioritizing privacy and infection control. Borough President Reynoso also looks forward to supporting outpatient services, such as social services and community care models, that address underlying issues facing people of color, increasing health insurance access for all birthing people, and more.  “Every maternal death is a tragedy, not only for the grieving family and community left behind,  but for society at large,” said Dr. Wilcox . “Maternal mortality is a key indicator of the health of a society, and is a reflection of the functioning of the overall health system in the United States. I commend Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso for shining a spotlight on this tragic issue and I am honored to be chosen as the co-chair of this taskforce. I look forward to working with the Borough President and other stakeholders in Brooklyn to solve this complex and difficult problem.  “I am humbled to accept the appointment as Co-Chair of Borough President Antonio Reynoso’s maternal mortality and morbidity taskforce. I am excited to work with someone so on fire for the holistic health of families,” said Grant . “I look forward to helping co-create new energy that gets activated around what we can do to empower birthing people, families, and communities to live their best lives through increased education, care, understanding, and resources. The Brooklyn Borough President shares my long-held desire to ensure that birth is safe, satisfying, and sacred. Collaborative midwifery care has the power to reconcile the abysmal statistics in Brooklyn as it has in other industrialized nations because it utilizes a relationship-based, shared-decision-making philosophy that addresses issues of reproductive justice, birth equity, health disparities, maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and primary care.  I have absolutely no doubt that in this season, under his leadership, shifts will happen that change the trajectory of the birthing experiences and outcomes in the borough of Brooklyn, making it the sought-out place to receive care and give birth in our city.”  “I was pleased to serve as the co-chair of the Brooklyn Borough President’s Transition Team and look forward to serving on this taskforce. In my tenure in City Council, I have advocated on many health issues, including maternal health and will continue to advocate for funding and collaboration between providers, hospitals and community-based organizations to improve maternal health outcomes,” said Hon. Clarke .  “I am honored to be serving on the Taskforce at such a key moment in public health history, where we are addressing injustices and inequities, and crafting sustainable solutions that center people who have been pushed to the margins,” said Dr. McNatt .  “I am extremely excited to support our new Brooklyn Borough President in his focus on comprehensive maternal health care; particularly, to tackle the crisis of Black and Brown women experiencing severe morbidity and mortality,” said Moses . “Brooklyn Perinatal Network, Inc. supports a holistic approach to care offered by community-based organizations, such as social health wrap-around service and community care models, that address underlying social determinants of health. I’m sure this taskforce will encourage a holistic care delivery environment that values alignment of outpatient resources, connection to care, and community care models that address underlying determinants that influence individual health outcomes and mitigates risks.”  “I am honored to be appointed by Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso to his maternal health taskforce.  Health care is a human right, and race should never be a factor in how health care is delivered. Especially during the perinatal period, it’s imperative that women of color receive culturally humble, trauma-informed, and person-centered care as this will strengthen and maintain their emotional wellness,” said Sparrock .  Taskforce members were selected due to their involvement in the Borough President’s transition team who have helped outline his maternal health priorities. Others were selected due to their work leading system transformations around care models in maternal health.

Antonio Reynoso is Brooklyn’s 20th Borough President. The son of two Dominican immigrants, Antonio was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, just three blocks down from where he lives today with his wife and two sons. He grew up in Section 8 housing, relying on food stamps for family meals and scholarships for education opportunities. He experienced firsthand how a little help can go a long way for a young family trying their hardest to put down roots and have a fair shot at the life they want. In 2021, Antonio became the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. Since then, he’s launched a history-making maternal health agenda and championed planning for a healthy, housed Brooklyn.

Made possible by a $100,000 grant from the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President to Met Council, America’s largest Jewish charity, a total of 500 post-partum families receiving care at select Brooklyn hospitals and clinics will receive “Born in Brooklyn” baby boxes. The baby boxes will come as diaper bags containing baby-friendly supplies carefully selected by the Borough President’s Maternal Health Taskforce, such as diapers, perineal spray, baby wipes, nursing pads, nipple cream, diaper changing mats, post-partum pads, burping cloths, swaddles, and City’s First Readers books. A resource one-pager will accompany the boxes, with links to helpful guides for first-time parents and city-wide services. New parents receiving care at NYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health, NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull, Caribbean Women’s Health Association, Brooklyn Perinatal Network, and Brownsville Neighborhood Health Action Center will begin to receive the baby boxes this month. This pilot builds on Borough President Reynoso’s commitment to reduce crisis-level maternal morbidity rates found among Black and Brown birthing people. “When I was elected, I made a promise to Brooklyn that I would make this the safest place in the city to have a baby,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso . “The time after having a baby can be both beautiful and intense, with new parents facing post-partum recovery, financial pressures, and new responsibilities. My hope is that these ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes and the items carefully selected by our fantastic maternal health taskforce can help lessen that burden on families so they can focus on caring for their newest family member as well as their own mental and physical wellbeing. A huge thank you to our partner Met Council for producing these wonderful baby boxes, and to NYC Health + Hospitals, Caribbean Women’s Health Association, Brooklyn Perinatal Network, and Brownsville Neighborhood Health Action Center for getting them into the hands of Brooklyn families.” “While welcoming a baby into the world is a wonderful and joyous experience, it can also be a stressful and anxiety-filled time for new parents,” said Met Council CEO David G. Greenfield . “That’s why we’re teaming up with Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso on this important initiative to make things easier during the post-partum period. Babies born in Brooklyn are a boon for our beautiful borough and providing the supplies and support that women need after childbirth will make a difference in their lives.” Black and Brown women in Brooklyn face the highest maternal morbidity rates in the city, with one-third of mothers who died in New York City residing in Brooklyn. The majority of these deaths occur post-partum, within the first year after giving birth. The leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths is mental health. A small but important piece in the preventative care puzzle, the “Born in Brooklyn” baby boxes are designed not only to be a source of financial support, but also a source of mental health support as new parents recover from the physical and financial toll of childbirth, as well as sometimes elongated, uncompensated maternity leave as a result of complications resulting from childbirth. “South Brooklyn Health is thankful for the support of Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso and the Met Council for providing Black and Brown families of South Brooklyn and surrounding communities with baby-friendly supplies that are not always easily accessible, but essential in caring for mom and baby,” said Dr. Maggie Tetrokalashvili, Chair of OB/GYN at NYC Health + Hospitals/ South Brooklyn Health . “Eliminating disparities in maternal morbidity between women of color and their White counterparts is an integral component of the care delivered at South Brooklyn Health, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with the Borough President in achieving health care equity.” “As we know, COVID has and continues to impact many communities, including ours in the Bed-Stuy/Williamsburg/Bushwick areas. At NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull, we are committed to our patients, and we recognize the importance of bringing resources to them. We are excited to be a distribution center for the ‘Born in Brooklyn’ boxes. These boxes will provide our parents-to-be with items needed as they embark the parenthood journey. We are grateful for the support and positive impact that these boxes will bring to postpartum patients and their families. Thank you, Borough President Reynoso and Met Council, in providing these boxes to our community patients,” said Ada Villatoro, Senior Associate Director of Maternal Child Health at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull . “Woodhull is proud to partner with Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Met Council to present our clients with the ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes. We hope that these small tokens celebrate the birth of the mother, newborn, and family and are also usable and helpful in meeting the community at their need,” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull Director of Midwifery Services Helena Grant, MS, CNM, LM, CICP, FACNM . “The ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes are making it even more exciting to be born in Brooklyn! The boxes contain specially chosen items to keep babies safe and provide extra loving comfort those who care for them. Sincere thanks to the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President with Met Council for making the ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes available to NYC Health + Hospital patients,” said Wendy Wilcox, MD, MPH, MBA, FACOG, NYC Health + Hospitals Chief Women’s Health Service Officer and co-chair of Borough President Reynoso’s Maternal Health Taskforce . “‘Born in Brooklyn’ boxes are full of items that serve the needs of parents and babies during the postpartum period. We are delighted to support families in these early days, and to help ease financial and other forms of stress,” said Dr. Zahirah McNatt, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . “We look forward to continuing to identify and respond to the needs of women and birthing persons across the borough of Brooklyn.” “This is an excellent initiative. Borough President Reynoso is making maternal and infant health in Brown and Black communities a well-appreciated priority,” said Director of Nursing-Maternal Child Health Services at NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County Vera Appiah-Agyemang, RN, MSN, CNM . “I am thankful for the distribution of the ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes to new parents. Having readily available resources at one’s disposal can help alleviate stress, and in turn help with emotional wellness,” said Christina Sparrock, Mental Health Advocate . During his campaign, Borough President Reynoso highlighted the gross inequity that Black pregnant people in Brooklyn are 9.4 times more likely to die due to childbirth complications than their white counterparts. As Borough President, he pledged to reduce this disparity in Brooklyn and make the borough the safest place to have a baby in the city by the end of his administration. “I commend Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso for his tremendous efforts to address the inequities in maternal healthcare and to make Brooklyn the safest borough in the city to have a baby. The ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby box program will surely provide relief and education to new parents, by not only providing some much-needed baby supplies, but also through the sharing information and resources to provide access to everything these parents will need to safely take care of their child,” said Chair of NYC Council Committee on Hospitals Mercedes Narcisse . “I recently gave birth at Woodhull Hospital, and while I had a positive, supportive experience, I also know there’s no such thing as too much support. The ‘Born in Brooklyn’ pilot is an important program that recognizes the real needs that moms have to keep themselves and their babies healthy. I’m grateful to Borough President Reynoso for his work in this space and continuing to lift up maternal health as a priority,” said Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez. “I am thrilled to see Borough President Reynoso’s Maternal Health Taskforce in action, and I know these families will be better for it. Both the newborns and their mothers can be most vulnerable immediately after birth, and it is the responsibility of our government to protect both the longtime and absolute-newest members of our communities. Standing up for Black and Brown women, who face the highest rates of maternal morbidity in New York City, is central to our objectives as elected representatives. I applaud Mr. Reynoso and his taskforce for their work with the ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes and look forward to their benefits being felt throughout the lifetimes of these brand-new Brooklynites and their mothers,” said Council Member Chi Ossé . “The importance of maternal and infant health doesn’t end when parents leave the hospital. This program from Borough President Reynoso will help give Brooklyn families the resources they need to feel prepared for this exciting moment in their lives,” said Council Member Lincoln Restler . In April 2022, Borough President Reynoso launched his Maternal Health Taskforce to begin developing and executing his maternal health agenda, and by July 2022, Borough President has allocated his entire $45M FY23 capital budget toward maternal health care improvements at the three Brooklyn public hospitals: NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County : $15.625M to renovate the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) and mother-baby units; NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island : $18.5M to renovate the outpatient care center, labor and delivery rooms, post-partum recovery rooms, and NICU; and NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull : $11M to build a state-of-the-art birthing center. Borough President Reynoso is the first Borough President to allocate an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. ### , • OFFICE: Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201 PHONE: (718) 802 – 3700 EMAIL: [email protected] Instagram Instagram X X Bluesky Bluesky Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso © 2025 | Brooklyn Borough President  ABOUT BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility CALENDAR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MATERNAL HEALTH NEWSROOM Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 DEPARTMENTS Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography CONNECT Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr YouTube LinkedIn Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Twitter Twitter Flickr Flickr YouTube YouTube LinkedIn LinkedIn

All her life, Rev. Kim Council has dedicated her career to the communities and people of Brooklyn, focused on finding ways to better lives and strengthen opportunities for all. As Deputy Borough President, she carries this work out on a borough-wide scale, working with faith-based and community leaders to find solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing our borough from housing to food insecurity and violence. Brooklyn-born and -raised, Kim grew up in HUD-subsidized housing as the oldest of five children. Her family grew up working hard to provide – fighting evictions and food insecurity despite both her parents working full-time jobs. While there wasn’t much spare cash in the home, there was boundless love and support. And in Bed-Stuy, neighbors always had each other’s backs. Fast forward some years, Kim is known as many things – law librarian, assistant pastor, and a former executive no-profit leader. Guided by her faith, her work is extensive and always on the forefront of the issues pressing Brooklyn. As the executive director of the Berean Community and Family Life Center, she provided preventative health care, built affordable housing, and created youth development programs and violence prevention programs. As vice chair of the Local Development Corporation of East New York, Kim was vital in providing resources and support to small businesses. And while president of the East Brooklyn Housing Development Corporation, she spearheaded the construction of over one thousand units of affordable housing. Now, as Brooklyn’s Deputy Borough President, Kim is a fearless community leader who has been continuously devoted to fighting for the best for Brooklyn communities across the borough. Leveraging on her expertise, within her first year at Borough Hall, she launched the administration’s first roundtable on how faith-based organizations can champion affordable housing in Brooklyn, built momentum to end gun violence boroughwide, and brought resources to Business Improvement Districts and merchant associations to help support local businesses. On the day-to-day, she meets Brooklynites and local organizations and businesses across the borough while problem-solving how to bring resources to the table to our communities that have been long underrepresented. Deputy Brooklyn Borough President Rev. Kim Council is Brooklyn’s own powerhouse of advocacy, wit, and hard work moving our borough forward. Today, Deputy Borough President Council calls Cypress Hills home, where she lives with her daughter and son, Nicole and George.

Fulfilling a primary campaign promise, Borough President Reynoso is allocating his entire FY23 capital funds – a total of $45M – across the three public hospitals in Brooklyn to help improve maternal health care services that will in turn reduce disparities in maternal mortality rates found between Black pregnant people and their white counterparts. Mr. Reynoso is the first Borough President to allocate an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. “Every expecting family deserves access to high-quality health care no matter the color of their skin or the language they speak,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams . “The root causes of racial disparities in maternal health are real, and we need all hands on deck to stamp out the inequities that have allowed children and mothers to die at the exact time when we should be welcoming a life. I’m grateful to Borough President Reynoso for this generous investment in our hospitals to save lives and ensure all new moms have access to world-class care.” “Regardless of intention or passion, one person can’t enact long-lasting solutions without the support of a small army that’s just as passionate and has the expertise to see those impactful changes through. I found a true partner in my fight against maternal mortality inequities in our city’s public health system,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso . “I look forward to working with NYC Health + Hospitals leadership, specifically at Woodhull and Brooklyn’s two other public hospitals, to ensure my ambitious capital funding yields results in lives saved. I’m confident that within four years, the conversation around maternal mortality in Brooklyn will be vastly different thanks to this allocation and the tireless work being done by our public health system.” “Brooklyn is the fastest growing borough in New York City and it has the second-highest birth rate. NYC Health + Hospitals applauds Borough President Antonio Reynoso for his vision to make Brooklyn one of the safest places to give birth,” said NYC Health + Hospitals President and CEO Mitchell Katz, MD . “While racial disparities in birth outcomes are evident nationwide, our health care system is committed to reducing and eliminating these inequalities by creating safer birth experiences for New Yorkers. The borough president’s investment in our patients and their families will help us further improve maternal health outcomes. We thank Mr. Reynoso for his tremendous partnership and generosity, and we are most grateful for his gift.” “On behalf of Woodhull Hospital and the community, I extend our thanks and appreciation to Brooklyn Borough President Reynoso for the generous support of $11 million to fund the expansion and improvement of our birthing center. The renovation of our birthing center will allow us to enlarge and modernize the labor and delivery operating rooms to provide a safer and more fulfilling experience for the mother, child, and their families,” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull CEO Gregory Calliste . Capital funding will go towards the new birthing center, renovating six private labor and birthing rooms, enhance the nurse’s station, post anesthesia care unit, and an upgrade of the triage and ante-partum rooms. The new design also includes a state-of-the-art OB stimulation lab and enlarged modernized operating rooms for cesarean births. “We are thrilled and thankful to our Borough President for the opportunity to provide our community with an enhanced, attractive, family-centered space in which high-quality birthing services can be provided,” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull COO Dr. Lisa Scott-McKenzie . “I am grateful to Brooklyn Borough President for this capital gift that will be used to transform the external environment of the labor and birthing suite, create a state-of-the-art birthing center, and enlarge and modernize the operating rooms at Woodhull.  More than this, I am grateful that he has lent his voice to the cause of making Brooklyn the safest and most satisfying Borough to give birth.  He has spoken often of not only how he envisions the facilities looking, but the benefit of the shared decision-making model of integrative midwifery and physician care he hopes will continue to be utilized at Woodhull and in other spaces. We share his vision for the community at Woodhull and we know that this contribution will provide birthing people greater and more positive ownership of their health, their pregnancy, and the outcomes.” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull Director of Midwifery Helena Grant . In addition to the Borough President’s capital allocation of $11M, Councilmembers Chi Ossé and Jennifer Gutiérrez, with the support of Speaker Adrienne Adams, allocated $1,776,00 and $500,000 respectively for additional upgrades to medical equipment at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull. During his campaign, Borough President Reynoso highlighted the gross inequity that Black pregnant people are 9.4 times more likely to die due to childbirth complications than their white counterparts. He pledged to reduce this disparity in Brooklyn, making the borough one of the safest places to have a baby in the country. Borough President Reynoso began working on this priority quickly after transitioning to his new role, launching his administration’s Maternal Health Taskforce in April 2022. The taskforce will help lead the foundation for strategizing around his maternal health agenda and expanding the taskforce. In addition to his capital allocations, Borough President Reynoso also looks forward to supporting outpatient services, such as social services and community care models, that address underlying issues faced by people of color, increasing health insurance access for all birthing people, and more. It is unconscionable that maternal death rates differ so drastically by race. I commend Borough President Antonio Reynoso for taking such aggressive and necessary action to help end the shocking and deplorable racial and socio-economic disparities in maternal health. I look forward to working with the Borough President Reynoso to ensure that no matter their color or economic status each Brooklynite has access to, and receives equitable and high-quality maternal care, and are never pushed to the side,” said Councilmember and Chair of the City Council Committee on Hospitals Mercedes Narcisse . “As we fight for equity across this city, investing in the spaces that keep black and brown women healthy and promote real preventative care has to be at the forefront. A state-of-the-art birthing center at Woodhull will make a profound difference in the lives of our community and will make huge strides in addressing maternal mortality. I recently gave birth at Woodhull, so I know firsthand how much their patients, midwives, nurses, and doctors will benefit from this important investment. They are so deserving of this allocation. I want to thank BP Reynoso for his commitment to funding our public hospitals and congratulate Woodhull for their advocacy in bringing this necessary resource to North Brooklyn,” said Councilmember Jennifer Gutiérrez . Maternal mortality and morbidity is a national issue that hits home in Brooklyn as our rates are the highest in New York City, shining a light on the racial inequity black and brown birthing people face due to lack of equitable medical care. Borough President Reynoso’s leadership on this critical issue is necessary to build our Health + Hospitals reputation as a birthing destination. By investing in birthing centers for Woodhull, Coney Island, and Kings County hospitals we are closing the gap to a historical disparity and creating equitable maternal health outcomes for safer birthing experiences,” said Councilmember Farah Louis. This extraordinary investment from Borough President Antonio Reynoso will get us one step closer to bringing down maternal mortality rates in Brooklyn. This is exactly the kind of ambitious, focused spending we need to keep Black mothers alive and tackle racism and inequity in Brooklyn,” said Councilmember Lincoln Restler . ### , , • OFFICE: Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201 PHONE: (718) 802 – 3700 EMAIL: [email protected] Instagram Instagram X X Bluesky Bluesky Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso © 2025 | Brooklyn Borough President  ABOUT BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility CALENDAR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MATERNAL HEALTH NEWSROOM Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 DEPARTMENTS Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography CONNECT Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr YouTube LinkedIn Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Twitter Twitter Flickr Flickr YouTube YouTube LinkedIn LinkedIn

The primary responsibility of the Brooklyn Topographical Bureau is to maintain the Borough Map and to furnish copies of the Map and related data to City agencies and the general public. What does the Topographical Bureau do ? Reviews ULURP Mappings The Topographical Bureau reviews all City Planning Commission ULURP (Uniformed Land Use Review Procedure) mappings. Whenever an alteration to the city map is made, our office reviews the map change to make sure that the map conforms to the standards set by our office. Provides Surveyors with Benchmarks and Monuments The Topographical Bureau provides surveyors with Benchmarks and Monuments in order to help them accurately survey a person’s property. This information provides both horizontal and vertical control, which allows the surveyor to find the city’s property line in relation to the private owner’s property line. Assigns, Verifies, and Enforces Addresses The Topographical Bureau has jurisdiction of the assignment, verification, and enforcement of all addresses within the borough. Most people who visit the Bureau to verify addresses or apply for new or additional ones are professional engineers or architects who are working on behalf of a property owner. The property owner might be having work done on their property and need to receive a new address or verify the address. Addresses are assigned based on entrance location, then sequentially, odd or even. Addresses assigned should be displayed prominently on the street entrance of the structure. Vanity addresses (addresses that do not conform to the regular addressing system established) may also be assigned as long as they do not conflict with the surrounding area both in location and addressing. Visiting the Brooklyn Topographical Bureau No Appointments are needed for regular business items, such as House number drop offs/pickups, title search work or surveying information. House Number Consultations still require an appointment. Surveyors, Title Searchers, & Researchers : None of the information you need from our office is online. You must come into our office for all maps, street status, and Benchmarks & Monument requests. All maps have a price associated with them (see our current fee schedule online). We do not take cash. Topographical Bureau Open Hours Hours are strictly enforced Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201 Monday: 9:30am – 11:45am 1pm – 2:45pm Tuesday: 9:30am – 11:45am 1pm – 2:45pm Wednesday: 9:30am – 11:45am 1pm – 2:45pm Thursday: CLOSED Friday: CLOSED Important Information & Resources Contact the Brooklyn Topographical Bureau General Contact (718) 802-3919 [email protected] Ms. Kellie O’Brien Deputy Director Phone: (718) 802-3989 Email: [email protected] [email protected] Ms. Jessica Kallo Office Manager Phone: (718) 802-3813 Email: [email protected] [email protected] Explore What’s Next Community boards are the grassroots of our local government.

But there is a major way in which our city gets it wrong: planning. Plain and simple, in New York City, we do not plan for things as simple as making sure every neighborhood has adequate parks, schools, and affordable housing. The city has no 10- or 20-year vision to guide our growth, investments, or how resources are directed. Nearly every other major city in the world has this – they’re called “comprehensive plans.” London has “The London Plan.” Delhi has “The Development Authority Master Plan.” Mexico City has “The General Development Plan.” New York City? New York City has nothing at all – because here, in the greatest city in the world, we do not plan, we only zone. And as a result, inequities run deep. In 2023, Borough President Reynoso took matters into his own hands and released his very own Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn – the largest borough-specific planning effort ever done in our history. The guiding document illustrates a new planning paradigm applied to Brooklyn, asking “what does it look like to plan for the public good?” “What does it look like to return to the heart of why we plan? To provide our residents with everything they need to be healthy, housed, and supported?” The Plan balances communities’ needs for health care, housing, transit, jobs, and more. It clarifies local as well as citywide needs, and it sets expectations so that we can all play a role in meeting the needs of the borough and this city. It’s a proposal for a different way to manage the city, a model for planning citywide, and a chance for New Yorkers to see the planning that’s possible, that we deserve, and that we should fight for citywide.

The son of two Dominican immigrants, Antonio was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, just three blocks down from where he lives today with his wife and two sons. He grew up in Section 8 housing, relying on food stamps for family meals and scholarships for education opportunities. He experienced firsthand how a little help can go a long way for a young family trying their hardest to put down roots and have a fair shot at the life they want. In 2021, Antonio became the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. As Borough President, he made history when he allocated the entirety of his Fiscal Year 2023 capital budget – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals to build new and state-of-the-art maternal health facilities. This marked the first time a Borough President had ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. In Fall 2023, Antonio released The Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the first borough-specific, large-scale planning effort ever in NYC and a model for planning citywide. Antonio previously served as Council Member for the 34th Council District, representing portions of Bushwick and Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens. As a member of the City Council, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management. He led to passage the Commercial Waste Zones and Waste Equity bills, as well as the Right to Know Act. Antonio also championed the Bushwick Community Plan, a community-led rezoning to create affordable housing, preserve manufacturing space, and advance neighborhood needs that the de Blasio administration ultimately blocked from advancing.                        Get to Know Antonio The Kid Antonio Reynoso was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, where he lived with his parents – both immigrants from the Dominican Republic – and two sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. Their home was always full of laughter and family. Every Sunday, first thing in the morning, his aunts and uncles were banging on the door to play dominoes. It was the best part of his week. The Student Antonio’s parents immigrated to the United States in the late ‘70s and began to build a new life in Williamsburg just as the NYC 1980s Crack Epidemic was coming to a fever pitch. His mother along with his aunts came together to discuss how they’d ensure their kids were safe and set on a path to success. The decision was swift and unanimous: they would put everything they had into getting their children the best educations possible. The Organizer After graduating Le Moyne College with his B.A. in political science, Antonio began working for ACORN under the leadership of legendary organizers Jon Kest and Bertha Lewis, helping to unionize childcare workers who had been left out of the salary, pensions, or healthcare opportunities they deserved. The Council Member Antonio represented Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens as District 34’s Council Member from 2014 until 2022. Over his two terms, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management; led to passage landmark bills such as the Waste Equity Law, Commercial Waste Zone Legislation, and the Right to Know Act; and developed the Bushwick Community Plan. The Borough President After completing his two terms as Council Member, Antonio was elected to serve as the 20 th President of the greatest borough in the city: Brooklyn. His borough presidency is historic in more ways than one. He is the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. Explore What’s Next Deputy Borough President, Reverend, and fierce community advocate are all words you can use to describe Kim Council.

The upgrades will convert both units into family-friendly spaces, providing comfort and privacy for parents and newborns, and help to close disparities of maternal mortality rates found among people of color compared to their white counterparts. NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County is the third hospital to receive funding through the Borough President’s FY23 capital budget, with the entire $45M budget being allotted across the three public hospitals in Brooklyn to help improve maternal health care services that will in turn reduce maternal mortality rates of Black pregnant people. Mr. Reynoso is the first Borough President to allocate an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. “When thinking through what could help save a life and make someone’s birthing experience more positive, we often think of the clinicians and equipment, even training. However, environment is critical to ensure a birthing person, their support system, and their care team have not just the necessary space but the proper surroundings to make someone feel at ease, and triage any life-threatening situation,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso . “As I’ve mentioned before, we’re thinking through all the ways pregnant people and their care teams can be empowered through the birthing experience to help save lives.” “Brooklyn is the fastest growing borough in New York City and it has the second-highest birth rate. NYC Health + Hospitals applauds Borough President Antonio Reynoso for his vision to make Brooklyn one of the safest places to give birth,” said NYC Health + Hospitals President and CEO Mitchell Katz, MD . “While racial disparities in birth outcomes are evident nationwide, our health care system is committed to reducing and eliminating these inequalities by creating safer birth experiences for New Yorkers. The borough president’s investment in our patients and their families will help us further improve maternal health outcomes. We thank Mr. Reynoso for his tremendous partnership and generosity, and we are most grateful for his gift.” “We are so grateful to Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso for his gift of more than $15 million dollars to NYC Health+ Hospitals/Kings County. Borough President Reynoso’s commitment to the women of Brooklyn is outstanding and aligns with the work NYC Health + Hospitals has been engaged in since 2018 to improve the health of women and families. The capital funding Borough President Reynoso has dedicated to NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County and the other Brooklyn facilities will change more than infrastructure — it will change the way in which our public health system delivers care to birthing patients. This gift will be transformational. NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County will provide patient-centered, family-centered holistic care. Thank you, Borough President Reynoso, for your foresight and vision to enhance the experience of birthing patients in Brooklyn,” said NYC Health + Hospitals Chief Women’s Health Officer Wendy Wilcox, MD, MPH, MBA, FACOG “I am proud to announce the upcoming renovation of NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County’s NICU and Mother-Baby units,” said NYC Health + Hospitals Chief Executive Officer Sheldon P. Mcleod . “These advancements will work towards combating the health disparities in maternal health. We continue to ensure all mothers who walk through our doors receive the highest quality care in a spacious, welcoming environment.” The $15.6 million capital allocation will help renovate and transform 22,500 square-feet of NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County that houses its NICU and Mother-Baby units. Patient rooms will become single-occupancy family rooms, allowing families comfort and privacy during their birthing experience. These new developments allow NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County to continue providing high-quality patient-centric care by offering the latest advancements to patients in an accommodating environment to encourage positive parent-infant relationships. “We are reminded every day in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County of the critical importance of safe and comprehensive care for pregnant people in our community,” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County Chief of Gynecology & Obstetrics Natalie Ohly, MD . “We are grateful for the support from our Brooklyn Borough President to improve the environment and create an even safer and welcoming birthing experience for our patients and their families.” During his campaign, Borough President Reynoso highlighted the gross inequity that Black pregnant people are 9.4 times more likely to die due to childbirth complications than their white counterparts. He pledged to reduce this disparity in Brooklyn, making the borough one of the safest places to have a baby in the country. Borough President Reynoso began working on this priority quickly after transitioning to his new role, launching his administration’s Maternal Health Taskforce in April 2022. The taskforce will help lay the foundation for strategizing around his maternal health agenda and expanding the taskforce. In addition to his capital allocations, Borough President Reynoso also looks forward to supporting outpatient services, such as social services and community care models, that address underlying issues faced by people of color, increasing health insurance access for all birthing people, and more. “The communities Kings County serves have some of the worst maternal health outcomes in New York State. We wouldn’t accept these disparities in other parts of the city, and we can’t accept them here. I’m grateful to the Borough President for these desperately-needed resources, and will continue the fight in Albany for quality, affordable healthcare for women and children in Central Brooklyn,” said New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie . “Maternal mortality and morbidity is a national issue that hits home in Brooklyn as our rates are the highest in New York City, shining a light on the racial inequity black and brown birthing people face due to lack of equitable medical care. Borough President Reynoso’s leadership on this critical issue is necessary to build our Health + Hospitals reputation as a birthing destination. By investing in birthing centers for Woodhull, Coney Island, and Kings County hospitals we are closing the gap to a historical disparity and creating equitable maternal health outcomes for safer birthing experiences,” said Councilmember Farah Louis . “Too often, our mothers, our women, and their need for quality and comprehensive maternal health support does not get the attention that it deserves. With today’s announcement we are making it clear that Brooklyn will not leave our women, and particularly mothers of color, behind any longer. New York City can and must do better to protect maternal health, and this investment of $15.625 million dollars shows that Brooklyn and our Borough President are serious about addressing and eradicating severe maternal mortality and morbidity. I thank Borough President Reynoso for his bold leadership on this topic,” said Councilmember Rita Joseph . Earlier this month, Borough President Reynoso announced a capital allocation of $11M to NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull to improve the hospital’s women’s health services by creating a state-of-the-art birthing center, and $18M to NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island to expand and centralize maternal health services on its campus. ### , • OFFICE: Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201 PHONE: (718) 802 – 3700 EMAIL: [email protected] Instagram Instagram X X Bluesky Bluesky Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso https://www.youtube.com/c/BPAntonioReynoso © 2025 | Brooklyn Borough President  ABOUT BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility BP Antonio Reynoso DBP Kim Council Team BKBP Accessibility CALENDAR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MATERNAL HEALTH NEWSROOM Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 Press Releases Testimonies Reports YouTube State of the Borough State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 State of The Borough 2025 State of the Borough 2024 State of the Borough 2023 DEPARTMENTS Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography Community Boards Constituent Services Funding Land Use & Planning Topography CONNECT Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr YouTube LinkedIn Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Twitter Twitter Flickr Flickr YouTube YouTube LinkedIn LinkedIn

Deputy Borough President Reverend Kim Council performed the event’s invocation, and Attorney General Letitia James, NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, and NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams provided special remarks before Reynoso took the stage. Reynoso looked back at 2023’s accomplishments – such as the launch of The Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the largest borough-specific planning effort ever in our city’s history – as well as the challenges that lie ahead. Emphasizing strained city services and widespread need, Borough President Reynoso called for Brooklyn to get “back to basics,” with a focus on ensuring residents are housed, healthy, and supported. “We are a city that does not make excuses. No matter the circumstances we are born into, no matter the challenges we face, we show up for this city and we deliver on the dreams of opportunity from which New York was born,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. “We do not fearmonger. We do not pit those with little against those with less. No matter how hard it is, New Yorkers get to work. We figure it out. These difficult times call for us to get back to basics: the basics of good governance and the basics of Brooklyn, which means never giving up, never making excuses, and never abandoning our neighbors.” A year after Borough President Reynoso invited government partners to use Brooklyn Borough Hall to aid in addressing the migrant crisis, Reynoso announced that Borough Hall would open as a satellite Asylum Application Help Center. To begin, between 20 and 25 pro-se applicants for employment authorization documents (EAD) would be supported each day by a team of attorneys and application assistants from the Asylum Application Help Center (AAHC). The center offers assistance by appointment only and initially operated Monday through Thursday from 9 am to 5pm, though later expanding the number of hours and days as the center scaled up to serve up to 45 applicants per day. Additional partners include the NYC Office of Asylum Seeker Operations (OASO), NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM), and the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI). In addition to Borough Hall as a satellite Asylum Application Help Center, Reynoso highlighted additional initiatives that would be ramping up in 2024, such as: A Housing League of pro-housing elected officials formed alongside Council Member Erik Bottcher to encourage city and state collaboration to create more housing supply; A redesign of Columbus Park outside of Borough Hall in partnership with Council Member Lincoln Restler, Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, and WXY Studio; A collaboration with Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) to offer one-on-one business counseling and education opportunities in English, Chinese, and Korean, along with access to affordable small business loans; An initiative to tackle deed theft in Central Brooklyn; and, A hub for inter-agency coordination at Borough Hall to bring waterborne freight back to Brooklyn.

With 18 community districts, Brooklyn has the most community boards of all five boroughs, each one full of people who care about the well-being of their community. Community boards work with city agencies, elected officials, and local leaders to ensure their neighborhood’s perspectives and needs are incorporated into the decisions that will affect them. This includes everything from housing development and public transit to our city’s budget and services like sanitation. What each community board focuses on is largely up to the people who comprise it, which is why it’s so important to get involved. Community Board FAQs How do I find my community board? To identify and learn more about your community district, visit communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov When and where do community boards meet? Community boards meet each month from September through June at an accessible, in-district location. All board members are required to attend the monthly meeting in person, as well as to join a committee and attend their committee’s meeting. The anticipated monthly time commitment is 6 to 8 hours. Does it cost money to serve on a community board? Do members make any money? No and no – it’s completely free to serve on a community board, and because it’s a volunteer position, members do not receive monetary compensation. Can I join a community board? All NYC residents 16 years and older who live, work, or have a significant interest in a community can serve on a community board. What is the application process for new applicants? There are two parts to the application process. First, you must fill out an application with information about you and your interest in joining a Brooklyn community board. Then, you will be scheduled for a brief, virtual conversation with a member of the Brooklyn Borough President’s team. Applicants will later be notified with a decision once board selections have been made. I’m not sure I’m ready to commit to being a full member. Are there other ways I can get involved? Absolutely! Community boards’ monthly meetings are open to the public, so feel free to check out what they’re like and attend regularly to stay up to date on the latest conversations happening in your neighborhood. You can find your local community board by visiting communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov. You can also join a committee as a “public member.” While public members can actively participate in committees’ discussions and make recommendations, they cannot vote are not official members of the community board.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu ABOUT ANTONIO Antonio Reynoso was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg as the son of two Dominican immigrants.  He first entered public office as a City Council Member representing Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens. In 2021, Brooklynites elected him Borough President to bring bold, progressive leadership to Borough Hall. Antonio’s time as Borough President has been impactful. From housing, jobs, environmental justice, immigration services, and more, Antonio has transformed the office into a platform for real policy change and a hub for direct services. His administration has provided asylum work authorization application assistance, fought food insecurity, and delivered capital investments in community spaces, healthcare facilities, and nonprofit organizations that serve Brooklyn’s diverse communities. Antonio’s commitment to justice and equity is deeply personal. Growing up in a community overrun by processing 40% of the City’s trash, he saw firsthand the impact of environmental racism. As a Chair of the Council’s Sanitation Committee, he took on New York’s private sanitation industry, passing landmark legislation to cut pollution and improve labor conditions. As Borough President, he is continuing this fight by championing policies to improve air quality and public health across the borough. Antonio is also a fierce advocate for housing and tenant rights, taking New York’s affordability crisis head-on, pushing for new affordable housing across Brooklyn, opposing down zoning that restrict the creation of new homes, and championing policies like the City of Yes and ADU expansion. His Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn provides a roadmap for equitable development, ensuring every neighborhood contributes to - and benefits from -  solving the city’s housing crisis. As a young father of two children in NYC public schools, including one with autism, Antonio understands the importance of investing in education, childcare, and family support systems. He has fought for increased special education services, expanded early intervention programs, and stronger protections for families navigating the school system. Throughout his career, Antonio has taken on tough battles—from fighting for more affordable housing across the entire borough to standing up against rollbacks on immigrant protections. He has never backed down from the fights that matter most to Brooklynites. Now, as he seeks re-election, Antonio remains committed to using every tool available to protect tenants, support working families, and make Brooklyn a place where everyone—regardless of background—has the opportunity to thrive.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

What Antonio Has Done: Champion policies like City of Yes and ADU expansion to increase housing supply. Oppose downzonings that restrict housing production.

By investing in housing and mental health solutions, Antonio will work to build a Brooklyn where no one is left behind. Food Insecurity: Antonio knows firsthand what it’s like to rely on government assistance to keep food on the table. Too many neighborhoods are food deserts, where fresh, affordable groceries are out of reach—especially for low-income communities and communities of color. Every Brooklynite deserves access to healthy, affordable food. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for systemic solutions to address food insecurity in underserved neighborhoods. Support community-led food initiatives that prioritize affordability and accessibility. Work to increase SNAP enrollment so eligible families receive the support they need.

Only then can Brooklyn be a borough where fresh, affordable food is a right—not a privilege. Climate and Resiliency Environmental justice has always been at the core of Antonio’s policy work because every Brooklynite deserves clean air, safe streets, and a sustainable future. From reducing truck traffic in overburdened neighborhoods to championing renewable energy, Antonio has fought for policies that put communities first. What Antonio Has Done: Champion Waste Equity to reduce the amount of trash processed in overburdened communities, cutting diesel-polluting truck traffic and improving air quality. Create Commercial Waste Zones to cut truck traffic by 50%—about 12 million miles per year. Support the Last Mile Coalition and worked with CM Alexa Avilés to regulate emissions from last-mile warehouses. Pass shore power legislation and a bill requiring DOT to redesign truck routes with input from environmental justice communities.

Education: As a proud parent of two public school students, Antonio knows firsthand the importance of a strong, well-funded public education system. Every child—regardless of zip code—deserves access to high-quality schools, modern resources, and the support they need to succeed. What Antonio Has Done: Direct over $40 million to fund public schools and CUNY during his time in Borough Hall. Oppose the expansion of network charter schools to ensure public dollars stay in the public school system.

Public education is not just a policy priority for me—it’s personal. Antonio will keep fighting to ensure every student in Brooklyn has the opportunities and resources to thrive. Transportation A reliable, efficient, and accessible transportation system is essential to keeping Brooklyn moving. Antonio has worked to improve transit, reduce congestion, and invest in sustainable infrastructure that benefits all New Yorkers.

Supporting Brooklyn Communities: Strong, thriving communities are the foundation of a just and equitable Brooklyn. From investing in nonprofits and public spaces to expanding financial access and immigrant services, Antonio committed to ensuring every neighborhood has the resources it needs to succeed. What Antonio Has Done: Launch the Nonprofit Acquisition Fund to prioritize capital funding for nonprofits seeking to buy permanent space.

Antonio’s commitment is to keep listening, advocating, and delivering for Brooklynites—because when Brooklyn’s communities are supported, the entire city benefits. Workers' Rights & Economic Justice Every worker deserves fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize. From app-based delivery workers to industrial laborers, Antonio has fought to protect and expand economic opportunities for working-class New Yorkers.

A thriving economy starts with protecting workers. Antonio will continue fighting to ensure every New Yorker has the dignity, security, and opportunity they deserve in the workplace. Planning & Land Use Equitable development starts with community-driven planning. Antonio has worked to ensure land use decisions prioritize affordability, accessibility, and environmental justice—putting the needs of Brooklynites first.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council. Launch a $250K public education campaign sharing pregnancy and postpartum health resources via bus ads and digital platforms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, targeting neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes. Invest over $1 million in Brookdale Hospital to renovate their NICU and improve care for vulnerable newborns. Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve.

But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives. ISSUES Housing Supportive Housing & Mental Health Food Insecurity Climate and Resiliency Education Transportation Supporting Brooklyn Communities Workers’ Rights & Economic Justice Planning & Land Use Maternal Health Housing Expanding affordable housing, protecting tenants, and preventing displacement are essential to keeping Brooklyn a place where everyone can thrive. That’s why Antonio developed the Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn —a roadmap for equitable growth with over 200 recommendations to ensure development benefits all Brooklynites, not just the wealthy. What Antonio Has Done: Champion policies like City of Yes and ADU expansion to increase housing supply. Oppose downzonings that restrict housing production.

With a focus on expanding supply, strengthening renter protections, and preserving affordability, Antonio will help build a more affordable and livable Brooklyn for all. Supportive Housing & Mental Health: Antonio believes that everyone deserves a safe, stable place to call home—whether it’s permanent supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness, mental health services for those in crisis, or investments that treat housing as a right, not a privilege.

Food Insecurity: Antonio knows firsthand what it’s like to rely on government assistance to keep food on the table.

Every Brooklynite deserves access to healthy, affordable food. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for systemic solutions to address food insecurity in underserved neighborhoods. Support community-led food initiatives that prioritize affordability and accessibility. Work to increase SNAP enrollment so eligible families receive the support they need.

Only then can Brooklyn be a borough where fresh, affordable food is a right—not a privilege. Climate and Resiliency Environmental justice has always been at the core of Antonio’s policy work because every Brooklynite deserves clean air, safe streets, and a sustainable future. From reducing truck traffic in overburdened neighborhoods to championing renewable energy, Antonio has fought for policies that put communities first. What Antonio Has Done: Champion Waste Equity to reduce the amount of trash processed in overburdened communities, cutting diesel-polluting truck traffic and improving air quality. Create Commercial Waste Zones to cut truck traffic by 50%—about 12 million miles per year. Support the Last Mile Coalition and worked with CM Alexa Avilés to regulate emissions from last-mile warehouses. Pass shore power legislation and a bill requiring DOT to redesign truck routes with input from environmental justice communities.

By prioritizing bold climate action and environmental justice, Brooklyn can have a healthier and more sustainable future that will benefit generations to come.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day.

But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council. Launch a $250K public education campaign sharing pregnancy and postpartum health resources via bus ads and digital platforms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, targeting neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes. Invest over $1 million in Brookdale Hospital to renovate their NICU and improve care for vulnerable newborns. Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve. WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

Planning & Land Use Equitable development starts with community-driven planning. Antonio has worked to ensure land use decisions prioritize affordability, accessibility, and environmental justice—putting the needs of Brooklynites first. What Antonio Has Done: Create the Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, outlining over 200 recommendations to address the intersection of land use, public health, and housing equity. Commit to holding public hearings for every ULURP proposal, ensuring Brooklynites have a say in land use decisions. Introduce Intro 870 with CM Shahana Hanif, requiring NYC Parks to publish annual accessibility assessments and create a public-facing map of accessible facilities. Lead public engagement sessions on the proposed Coney Island Casino, ensuring community voices are heard. Advocate for BQE safety and environmental justice reforms, partnering with the BQE Environmental Justice Coalition. Allocate over $18 million to the Parks Department to maintain and expand green spaces, with nearly $5 million dedicated to the Bed-Stuy Parks Initiative.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council. Launch a $250K public education campaign sharing pregnancy and postpartum health resources via bus ads and digital platforms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, targeting neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes. Invest over $1 million in Brookdale Hospital to renovate their NICU and improve care for vulnerable newborns. Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve. WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

By investing in nonprofit stability, expanding financial access, and ensuring that local organizations have the resources they need, Brooklyn can be a borough where every neighborhood thrives. Antonio’s commitment is to keep listening, advocating, and delivering for Brooklynites—because when Brooklyn’s communities are supported, the entire city benefits. Workers' Rights & Economic Justice Every worker deserves fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize. From app-based delivery workers to industrial laborers, Antonio has fought to protect and expand economic opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for Deliveristas, pushing the city to ensure fair wages and humane working conditions for app-based delivery workers. Support manufacturing retention by testifying in favor of City of Yes for Economic Opportunity. Advocate for maintaining manufacturing districts in South Brooklyn to protect industrial jobs.

Fund renovations at a District 75 school to establish workforce training programs in auto repair, beauty, and culinary arts, creating career pathways for students with disabilities. A thriving economy starts with protecting workers. Antonio will continue fighting to ensure every New Yorker has the dignity, security, and opportunity they deserve in the workplace. Planning & Land Use Equitable development starts with community-driven planning. Antonio has worked to ensure land use decisions prioritize affordability, accessibility, and environmental justice—putting the needs of Brooklynites first. What Antonio Has Done: Create the Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, outlining over 200 recommendations to address the intersection of land use, public health, and housing equity.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council. Launch a $250K public education campaign sharing pregnancy and postpartum health resources via bus ads and digital platforms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, targeting neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes. Invest over $1 million in Brookdale Hospital to renovate their NICU and improve care for vulnerable newborns. Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve. WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

Antonio’s commitment is to keep listening, advocating, and delivering for Brooklynites—because when Brooklyn’s communities are supported, the entire city benefits.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council.

Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve. WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives. ISSUES Housing Supportive Housing & Mental Health Food Insecurity Climate and Resiliency Education Transportation Supporting Brooklyn Communities Workers’ Rights & Economic Justice Planning & Land Use Maternal Health   Housing Expanding affordable housing, protecting tenants, and preventing displacement are essential to keeping Brooklyn a place where everyone can thrive.

By investing in housing and mental health solutions, Antonio will work to build a Brooklyn where no one is left behind.  Food Insecurity: Antonio knows firsthand what it’s like to rely on government assistance to keep food on the table.

From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

That’s why Antonio developed the Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn —a roadmap for equitable growth with over 200 recommendations to ensure development benefits all Brooklynites, not just the wealthy. What Antonio Has Done: Champion policies like City of Yes and ADU expansion to increase housing supply. Oppose downzonings that restrict housing production.

Ensure Brooklyn prioritizes stable housing and accessible mental health services as key to public safety and community well-being. By investing in housing and mental health solutions, Antonio will work to build a Brooklyn where no one is left behind. Food Insecurity: Antonio knows firsthand what it’s like to rely on government assistance to keep food on the table. Too many neighborhoods are food deserts, where fresh, affordable groceries are out of reach—especially for low-income communities and communities of color. Every Brooklynite deserves access to healthy, affordable food. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for systemic solutions to address food insecurity in underserved neighborhoods. Support community-led food initiatives that prioritize affordability and accessibility. Work to increase SNAP enrollment so eligible families receive the support they need.

Invest in sustainable, community-driven solutions to eliminate food deserts across Brooklyn. Food insecurity must be addressed at its root. Only then can Brooklyn be a borough where fresh, affordable food is a right—not a privilege. Climate and Resiliency Environmental justice has always been at the core of Antonio’s policy work because every Brooklynite deserves clean air, safe streets, and a sustainable future. From reducing truck traffic in overburdened neighborhoods to championing renewable energy, Antonio has fought for policies that put communities first. What Antonio Has Done: Champion Waste Equity to reduce the amount of trash processed in overburdened communities, cutting diesel-polluting truck traffic and improving air quality. Create Commercial Waste Zones to cut truck traffic by 50%—about 12 million miles per year. Support the Last Mile Coalition and worked with CM Alexa Avilés to regulate emissions from last-mile warehouses. Pass shore power legislation and a bill requiring DOT to redesign truck routes with input from environmental justice communities.

What Antonio Will Do: Hold Governor Hochul accountable to climate commitments, including supporting the NY HEAT Act and expanding the NY Solar Tax Credit.

By prioritizing bold climate action and environmental justice, Brooklyn can have a healthier and more sustainable future that will benefit generations to come. Education: As a proud parent of two public school students, Antonio knows firsthand the importance of a strong, well-funded public education system. Every child—regardless of zip code—deserves access to high-quality schools, modern resources, and the support they need to succeed. What Antonio Has Done: Direct over $40 million to fund public schools and CUNY during his time in Borough Hall. Oppose the expansion of network charter schools to ensure public dollars stay in the public school system.

Public education is not just a policy priority for me—it’s personal. Antonio will keep fighting to ensure every student in Brooklyn has the opportunities and resources to thrive. Transportation A reliable, efficient, and accessible transportation system is essential to keeping Brooklyn moving. Antonio has worked to improve transit, reduce congestion, and invest in sustainable infrastructure that benefits all New Yorkers.

What Antonio Has Done: Launch the Nonprofit Acquisition Fund to prioritize capital funding for nonprofits seeking to buy permanent space. Allocate $1.25 million to Mixteca in Sunset Park, supporting their purchase of a new, fully accessible headquarters. Allocate $500,000 to the Arab American Association of New York.

Antonio’s commitment is to keep listening, advocating, and delivering for Brooklynites—because when Brooklyn’s communities are supported, the entire city benefits. Workers' Rights & Economic Justice Every worker deserves fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize. From app-based delivery workers to industrial laborers, Antonio has fought to protect and expand economic opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for Deliveristas, pushing the city to ensure fair wages and humane working conditions for app-based delivery workers. Support manufacturing retention by testifying in favor of City of Yes for Economic Opportunity. Advocate for maintaining manufacturing districts in South Brooklyn to protect industrial jobs.

Fund renovations at a District 75 school to establish workforce training programs in auto repair, beauty, and culinary arts, creating career pathways for students with disabilities. A thriving economy starts with protecting workers. Antonio will continue fighting to ensure every New Yorker has the dignity, security, and opportunity they deserve in the workplace. Planning & Land Use Equitable development starts with community-driven planning. Antonio has worked to ensure land use decisions prioritize affordability, accessibility, and environmental justice—putting the needs of Brooklynites first.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause. Form a Maternal Health Task Force of Black and Brown experts in women’s healthcare, pregnancy support, and community-based solutions to improve maternal outcomes. Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council. Launch a $250K public education campaign sharing pregnancy and postpartum health resources via bus ads and digital platforms in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, targeting neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes. Invest over $1 million in Brookdale Hospital to renovate their NICU and improve care for vulnerable newborns. Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve. WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu WHERE ANTONIO STANDS ON THE ISSUES Brooklyn is the Borough of opportunity, built on the strength of its people, its diversity, and its resilience. But today, many communities are facing urgent challenges—an affordability crisis pushing families out of their homes, a fight for community safety that prioritizes criminalization over crime prevention, and an economy that is not working for all of us. Brooklyn needs bold, principled leadership that will take on these fights and deliver real results. As Borough President, Antonio Reynoso is leading the charge on improving the lives of all Brooklynites, with the mission of creating “a Brooklyn for all.” Antonio is running for re-election because he knows that by continuing to fight for bold, people-first policies, Brooklyn can become a more just and equitable place. From delivering truly affordable housing and improving health outcomes—especially for mothers and babies—to advancing environmental justice and expanding alternatives to incarceration, he has remained committed to tackling the challenges that working-class communities and communities of color face every day. At a time when many Brooklynites feel disillusioned with politics, Antonio remains focused on delivering real results and using every tool available to improve people’s lives.

Food Insecurity: Antonio knows firsthand what it’s like to rely on government assistance to keep food on the table. Too many neighborhoods are food deserts, where fresh, affordable groceries are out of reach—especially for low-income communities and communities of color. Every Brooklynite deserves access to healthy, affordable food. What Antonio Has Done: Advocate for systemic solutions to address food insecurity in underserved neighborhoods. Support community-led food initiatives that prioritize affordability and accessibility. Work to increase SNAP enrollment so eligible families receive the support they need.

Climate and Resiliency Environmental justice has always been at the core of Antonio’s policy work because every Brooklynite deserves clean air, safe streets, and a sustainable future.

By prioritizing bold climate action and environmental justice, Brooklyn can have a healthier and more sustainable future that will benefit generations to come. Education: As a proud parent of two public school students, Antonio knows firsthand the importance of a strong, well-funded public education system. Every child—regardless of zip code—deserves access to high-quality schools, modern resources, and the support they need to succeed. What Antonio Has Done: Direct over $40 million to fund public schools and CUNY during his time in Borough Hall. Oppose the expansion of network charter schools to ensure public dollars stay in the public school system.

Antonio’s commitment is to keep listening, advocating, and delivering for Brooklynites—because when Brooklyn’s communities are supported, the entire city benefits. Workers' Rights & Economic Justice Every worker deserves fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize.

Antonio will keep fighting for a more just, sustainable, and community-led approach to land use and development. Maternal Health Antonio’s commitment to maternal health is personal. When Antonio and his wife were expecting their first child, Antonio saw firsthand the racial disparities in prenatal care. In some hospitals, they were rushed through appointments without the chance to ask questions. Learning that his wife was nine times more likely to die in childbirth solely on the basis of her race was a wake-up call. Antonio knew then that if he ever had the power to change this system, he would. What Antonio Has Done: Allocate $45 million (entire FY23 capital funding) for maternal healthcare improvements at Brooklyn public hospitals, including NICU renovations, outpatient care enhancements, and labor-and-delivery room redesigns—marking the first time a Borough President has dedicated an entire year’s capital budget to one cause.

Distribute 500 ‘Born in Brooklyn’ baby boxes with free baby and postpartum supplies through a $100K grant to Met Council.

Pass the Newborn Navigator Act (Local Law 110 of 2024) with CM Jennifer Gutiérrez, requiring the Department of Health to develop and distribute resource materials for new parents and maintain a searchable online directory of maternal health organizations. What Antonio Will Do: Expand investments in maternal health infrastructure to ensure Brooklyn hospitals have state-of-the-art labor and delivery facilities. Support and spread awareness of the work done by the Maternal Health Task Force. Continue growing the Community Baby Shower Fund to reach more families in high-risk neighborhoods with essential supplies and support on top of the initial $50K investment. Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations to provide maternal health education and postpartum support for new parents. Too many Black and Brown families face unnecessary risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to systemic neglect and racial bias in healthcare. Antonio refuses to accept a system that treats these tragedies as inevitable. This fight is personal, and Antonio will keep working to ensure every parent gets the care and dignity they deserve.
