We need more police and we need the city to spend the same amount of money that is spent in other precincts. We need community-policing, better cameras, enhanced security infrastructure and better lighting. Housing The North Shore needs smart, community-driven housing solutions that keep longtime residents in place while making room for growth. I propose converting vacant buildings into affordable housing, and requiring new developments to include affordable units. To prevent displacement, we must strengthen tenant protections, expand homeownership assistance, and provide property tax relief for struggling homeowners. By working with non-profits, local businesses, and faith-based organizations, we can create housing that serves our community - not just developers. Economic Development Every single empty storefront represents potential jobs. We need to do everything we can to get businesses to fill up into those storefronts and hiring people. We must advocate for policies that promote job creation, attract new small businesses to the district, and improve transportation access to support these enterprises. Furthermore, we must address issues that lead to the closure of businesses, such as the recent loss of Vinum, a Michelin-rated restaurant, due to challenges posed by criminal activity, drug abuse, and prostitution. Education We want future generations to have the best possible learning experience. This includes smaller class sizes, reintroducing home economics in high schools to prepare juniors and seniors for real-world challenges, and expanding STEM programs. It’s equally important to provide more after-school options for students. Additionally, the city has fallen short in adequately funding programs for children with special needs. As a mother of a child with an IEP, I strongly advocate for the expansion and enhancement of these programs. We must also bring back vocational training through shop classes to equip students with practical skills for their future. Transportation We must prioritize revitalizing the North Shore Rail Link and improving bus services to ensure efficient transportation. No one should face a 90-minute commute from Arlington to Manhattan. We need better transportation alternatives, including the expansion of fast-ferry services across Staten Island’s North Shore. Faber Park would be an ideal location for a new ferry terminal to enhance accessibility and connectivity.

(Advance/SILive.com) By Kyle Lawson | klawson@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — New York State officials have denied parole for the man convicted in the shooting death of NYPD Officer Gerard Carter, state records show. The parole applicant, now 43-year-old Shatiek Johnson, was sentenced on a top count of murder to 25 years to life in prison in connection with the 1998 slaying. He currently is serving out his sentence at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York. A jury determined Johnson, then 17 years old, shot Carter, 28, who was seated in a marked police van in the courtyard of the West Brighton Houses. The murder came amid an uptick in violence across the city and strained relations between police and some residents in socioeconomically struggling communities. Carter had been working as part of an impact team in the borough’s public housing complexes, and lived nearby with his family. His funeral was attended by scores of fellow officers and top city officials. A community center in Stapleton bears his name. Carter was survived by his former wife, Jozette, and son, Louis. “Louis and I are relieved that the man who stole Gerard from us will stay in prison for now,” said Jozette Carter-Williams on Tuesday, in regard to the board’s decision. Parole board process When considering parole for an inmate, the Board of Parole looks at correspondence from family and friends of both the victim and the person convicted, while assessing the applicant’s current thoughts on the incident itself. They also measure an applicant’s participation in rehabilitative programs, their plans on surviving in a world that in many ways has passed them by, and their disciplinary record while in prison. ‘I love my brother’ Johnson had been described by some police, prosecutors, neighbors and friends as a once “nice kid” who loved to play basketball, before becoming enveloped in a criminal lifestyle. At 15, he was convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of a homeless man over a $10 debt, the New York Daily News reported at the time. His older brother, when contacted about Johnson’s first parole hearing in 2023, said simply, “I love my brother.” He otherwise declined to comment. ’27 parole hearing Johnson is again eligible for parole in 2027, which Carter’s family said is too soon. “It is painful to think that we will have to reopen these wounds and go through this process again in just two years,” Carter-Williams said. NYPD Police Officer Gerard Carter is seen in this archival photo patrolling the borough's North Shore, shot prior to Carter's 1998 death. Staten Island Advance “Louis will never get a second chance to grow up with his father. I will never get another chance to see my best friend. It is fundamentally unfair this killer will keep getting second chances he doesn’t deserve.” The head of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York has echoed those sentiments. “The time between parole hearings should be lengthened to minimize the trauma on suffering family members like Louis and Jozette,” said PBA President Patrick Hendry in a statement leading up to Johnson’s parole hearing. In this Jan. 5, 2024 photo, Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, spoke at a press conference in front of FDNY rescue 5 in Emerson Hill in support of a new funding toward the World Trade Center Health Program budget.

Get Involved Contribute Meet Jozette Carter-Williams Meet Jozette Carter-Williams A Leader with Vision, Heart, and Deter Jozette Carter-Williams is a dynamic individual with a rich personal and professional history that showcases her resilience, creativity, and commitment to making a meaningful difference. Born in Brooklyn, NY and at the age of 3 years, she moved to Staten Island where she has lived for more than 50 yrs. Jozette’s heritage reflects her deep Puerto Rican and Taino roots, which have shaped her strength and perspective. Jozette’s academic journey is marked by ambition and adaptability. She attended Immaculate Conception School, spent three formative years at Staten Island Tech, and graduated from New Dorp High School. She further honed her analytical and technical skills at the College of Staten Island, where she studied Computer Science with a minor in Accounting. Currently, she is pursuing her passion for art and storytelling at the Academy of Art University, working toward a degree in Photography and the Arts. Her professional career spans nearly three decades, beginning in 1995 with a successful tenure in the banking industry that lasted until 2024. However, Jozette’s entrepreneurial spirit led her to found JoJo Cee Photography in 2010. Through this venture, she not only captured meaningful moments but also gave back to the community, contributing her talents to organizations such as the American Cancer Society, Blue Lives Matter, and Autism Warriors. Jozette’s dedication to service extends far beyond her career. She is the visionary founder of two non-profit organizations that honor the legacy of her late ex-husband, Police Officer Gerard Carter, who tragically lost his life in the line of duty. The Police Officer Gerard Carter Athletic Organization (established in 2001) and the PO Gerard Carter Foundation (founded in 2019) provide vital support and opportunities to children in the Stapleton community—an area deeply connected to Officer Carter’s work and sacrifice. These initiatives reflect Jozette’s unwavering commitment to uplifting others and fostering positive change. On a personal level, Jozette’s life is filled with love and purpose. She is married to Grady Williams and is a proud mother of three children—Louis, Selena, and Jason—and two bonus children, Grady IV and Jenese.
