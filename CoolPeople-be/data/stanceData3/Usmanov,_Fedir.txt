Together We Can. "I am running to bring a fresh approach, real accountability, and bold solutions to a system that has failed us for too long. This campaign is about action—not empty promises—ensuring every dollar is spent wisely, and every community member’s voice is heard. TOGETHER, WE CAN make our district the model for change, proving that when people demand better, real progress happens." - Fedir Usmanov, Candidate for New York City Council District 47 Why Am I Running for Office? I am running because our city needs a fresh approach, real accountability, and leaders who put people over politics. Unlike career politicians who promise to fix the same problems their predecessors did, I am focusing on specific deliverables. Supporting education, public safety, transportation, sanitation, and small businesses isn’t up for debate—that’s a must. The real question is how we make sure every dollar spent actually improves people’s lives. At my age, my passion for making a difference far outweighs any ambition for political status. I am running to fix what’s broken and bring meaningful change to our community. I am running because our city needs a fresh approach, real accountability, and leaders who put people over politics.

I am running to fix what’s broken and bring meaningful change to our community. I have worked hard to get where I am. I have a strong academic record, a 3.9 GPA, and an admission to Boston University for a Master of Science. I have received job offers from major firms, but I know that right now, I have the greatest amount of energy, passion, and drive to make an impact. This is the time to fight for real change, and I refuse to sit back and watch as politicians continue to waste opportunities and resources. I have worked hard to get where I am.

People are tired of the same political games—they want leaders who actually listen and deliver results. I am here to prove that we, the people, demand change. My mission is not just about winning an election; it is about making it clear to those in power that we will no longer accept inefficiency, and broken promises.

My mission is not just about winning an election; it is about making it clear to those in power that we will no longer accept inefficiency, and broken promises. I know that some politicians don’t want me to run. They fear someone who isn’t part of the system, someone who will truly fight for the people rather than protect the status quo. I don’t have the vast resources or deep-pocketed donors that career politicians rely on, but what I do have is the support of the people and the determination to fight for what’s right.

As a first-generation immigrant from a working class family, I understand firsthand the challenges many New Yorkers face. Since the age of 16, I have been deeply involved in my family’s nonprofit, which provides opportunities for low-income youth to explore art and cultural diversity. Through this work, I saw how access to the right resources can transform lives and strengthen communities. My journey has been one of perseverance, innovation, and service to the community.

Through this work, I saw how access to the right resources can transform lives and strengthen communities. For the past four years, I have been actively engaged in local politics, elections, and policymaking, gaining firsthand experience in how government operates—and where it fails to deliver for the people. I have also worked to empower the next generation, regularly hosting mentorship meetings with high school and college students, teaching financial literacy, leadership, and problem-solving skills that schools often overlook.

Currently, I am earning my degree in Operations Management and Political Science at CUNY Baruch, where I have developed innovative solutions to complex problems, applying my expertise to budget allocation, efficiency, and governance. My academic excellence, with a 3.9 GPA and admission to Boston University for a Master of Science, reflects my drive to constantly improve and implement real-world solutions. Though I have received job offers from major firms, I know that right now, my energy, passion, and skills are needed most in public service.
