US News Minnesota state employee who allegedly caused over $20K in damages to Teslas is let off by woke DA — as cops slam deal By Patrick Reilly Published April 22, 2025 Updated April 22, 2025, 12:07 p.m. ET A progressive district attorney has declined to charge the state employee in Tim Walz-led Minnesota who was allegedly caught causing $20,000 damage by vandalizing half a dozen Teslas — a decision the local police chief ripped as the latest betrayal of victims. The suspected vandal, 33-year-old Minnesota government employee Dylan Bryan Adams, was allegedly spotted keying the vehicles and stripping their paint off while out walking his dog around the city. Despite what police believe to be evidence of Adams committing felonies, Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty will seek diversion rather than criminal charges. 3 A man caught on camera causing thousands of dollars in damages to at least six Tesla vehicles in Minneapolis. “This is an approach taken in many property crime cases and helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses,” the attorney’s office said in a statement, CBS News reported . Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the time of the incident that the damage in each case was the equivalent of a felony. The chief said in a scathing statement on Monday that Moriarty’s decision not to bring charges is frustrating for his officers and the public. 3 Dylan Adams, who works for the Minnesota Department of Human Services, is accused of causing damage to several Tesla vehicles. Hennepin County Sheriff's Office “The Minneapolis Police Department did its job. It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified, and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney Office for consideration of charges,” he told KARE in a statement . “This case impacted at least six different victims and totaled over $20,000 in damages. Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office. “Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined. In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same,” O’Hara said in a statement.

Tim Walz said watching Tesla’s stock price plummet gave him “a little boost during the day” during a rally in Wisconsin. Adams, who works for Minnesota’s Department of Human Services, is not a political appointee in Walz’s administration, a spokesperson for the governor said last week. He is one of more than 40,000 state employees, the rep added. Moriarty has been Hennepin County’s top prosecutor since January 2023 after handedly winning the nonpartisan DA election, but the former public defender quickly came under fire for her woke policies that allowed accused rapists and killers to stay free. 3 A man who police say is Dylan Adams is caught on vehicle surveillance vandalizing a Tesla. FOX  9 via Minneapolis Police During her very first week in office, she dropped the charges against a 35-year-old man accused of raping a teen girl due to attorney misconduct, CBS News reported at the time. In another high-profile case , Moriarty was taken off the case of murdered 23-year-old Zaria McKeever after the progressive prosecutor offered slaps on the wrist for the teenage defendants; While prosecutors initially wanted to try both boys as adults, they were offered probationary deals in exchange for testimony against McKeever’s ex, who hired them.

But he's clueless.....because he didn't play, coach, scout or do anything related to baseball except write about it.

Ratings and Reviews 4.1      19.8K Ratings   Osogood4 , Closest youâll find to unbiased reporting The fact is, weâre all biased. If you disagree, itâs obvious that youâre incredibly biased. Bias is natural. Unfortunately, CNN, ABC, MSNBC, etc., have taken an âif you canât beat âem, join âemâ response to Fox Newsâ ongoing bias. So we have to take everything with a grain of salt nowadays. NYP is one of the few publications Iâve found that goes after both sides, which is so important in keeping government in check! Like only hearing one personâs side in a divorce, if you only ever get one side of the story, your story isnât accurate. Again, itâs only less biased. I can definitely see a republican spin. But itâs nothing like the stations I mentioned earlier, who do nothing but add their opinions on everything in an attempt to scare people into staying glued to the TV, and eventually voting the way they want them to vote.   Katniss821 , Good not great I generally like the app and would give it more stars but for a few extremely annoying aspects.  First, pop up ads and videos that are impossible to stop and/turn off without clicking on them, which takes you to the advertiser (advertisers - hope you donât pay by the click).  This has gotten increasingly worse. I used to be able to control this but no longer.  Second, is the Top News and Latest Stories tabs, combined with failure to refresh with new articles. Instead, they are usually just shuffled over the course of a day.  Plus there is no real difference between top news and latest stories - it is the same 10 articles, just in a different order.  The other categories rarely change their stories over the course of a day, which defeats the purpose of an app. Need some variance and more updating in all of this. Also need more content checking - misspelled words, missing words at times is understandable with breaking news but not when the article is up for more than a few hours.  Despite the foregoing, I still use this app all the time and like it because, overall, the content is different from what you get elsewhere.  But the increased pop ups and videos may cause me to delete the app.   DanH88 , Great app & news but a REALLY annoying refresh problem This app is constantly now refreshing without the annoying message mentioned below. WHAT GOOD IS A NEWS APP THAT DOESNâT LET YOU READ THE NEWS???The NYPost app is great and has really decent coverage of local to global events. Recently though a really annoying message continually interferes with reading the stories. Often a âShow Latest Updatesâ button is far too aggressive. Sometimes you canât even scroll past the FIRST story before it pops up. Who knows why? The first story hadnât of updated, maybe itâs to force more ads into a readers face? Overall though it is really low class and constantly annoying!!! Hopefully whatever person built this in is replaced with someone far more professional. They have great content, but the reading experience is constantly, now a days, just nightmare. It would be nice if it never appeared again, or maybe it does only if the very end of the feed is reached. But give us a break!!! Popping up within seconds of actually just looking at the feed is pathetic!

The online news version is horrible: long load and reload times for stories, pages jumping due to ads constantly occurring. I wish they had a premier version of this app where I could pay 20 or 30 dollars a year and simply be able toreador the online stories without the delays.   The food critic1234 , App is awful For what is being charged the app should work and it doesnât.â¦. Its takes minutes to load a page on brand new IPad.  Most of the time the page doesnât load at all or when you finish an article and attempt to go back to the main feed, the app just hangs regardless of how many times you push refresh. Something is basic as pages loading should be automatic You pay a hefty subscription fee, and when open an article where the video is the centerpiece of the article they make you sit through a minute or two ads.  Why am i forced to watch an ad if i am paying full price for the subscriptionâ¦.. you need to make the app load correctly everytime and you need to knock off the constant ads for full fee subscribersâ¦ otherwise i am done â¦. Now that X offers all the same material real time with no delay and the ability to fact check on Grokâ¦. i dont need to have this subscription at all and i am sure a lot of other people feel the same way â¦. I have subscribed since the post has been available electronicallyâ¦. So you are about to lose a loyal long time customerâ¦â¦. Do what you want with these commentsâ¦. But new users bewareâ¦.. knowing what i know i would never subscribeâ¦..   Midtown - Jerry , UNABLE TO ACCESS NEWS STORIES I am attempting to access NY POST stories but canât get in because a monetary subscription page keeps popping up which prevents me from navigating the app?  Very annoying and aggravating.  Software is flawed. 2) I previously had to delete the app and then reinstall it because it was not recognizing my Password which was only one (1) day old. When I attempted to Log In with one of the three (3) big tech companies the spinning field was circling round and round and would not stop.  It would have continued eternally.  Therefore I had to delete the NY POST APP and then reinstall it. CONCLUSION I was unable to register to âADD A COMMENTâ on a stinky NY City.  It would not recognize my Password.  This problem is not isolated to the NY POST.  It happens all over the Internet and users expend untold amount of wasted man-hours efforts. PLEASE NOTE: Do a story on the never-ending wasted man-hour efforts on PASSWORDS, USER-IDâs, and EMAILS which are never recognized by all these outrageous worthless softwares which never get things right?

TRY IT NOW RJ Luis Jr.’s name is currently in the transfer portal and the NBA draft , but the former St. John’s star made it clear Thursday that one of those is a clear preference over the other. “I’m fully into the draft right now,” Luis said before accepting the Lt. Frank J. Haggerty Metropolitan Player of the Year Award, as decided by the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association. “The transfer portal’s kind of like a backup plan. Just weighing my options in case I don’t like anything that’s going on as far as the draft. Definitely fully focusing on the draft right now.” Currently, Luis has a “Do Not Contact” attached to his name in the portal. He’s working out in Florida with the full intention of going to the draft combine and keeping his name in the draft, with shooting being a heavy focus. 5 RJ Luis Jr. talks with reporters at the MBWA All-Met Haggerty Awards on April 24. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post 5 RJ Luis Jr. attempts a shot during the St. John’s game against Omaha on March 20. Charles Wenzelberg “Just staying square,” said Luis, who shot 33.6 percent from 3-point range last season. “Lot of balance, lot of repetitions. Trying to get a quicker release, obviously shoot the ball on motion. And obviously, the line is a little further back [in the NBA], so just getting used to that.” Luis had a breakout junior season, leading the Johnnies to the Big East Championship and a No. 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament while averaging 18.2 points and 7.2 rebounds. The 6-foot-7 wing’s season ended in ignominious fashion, however, as he was benched down the stretch of a second-round upset loss to No. 10 seed Arkansas in the NCAA Tournament.

Corey Sipkin for the NY Post He said Thursday that the way the season ended had no bearing on his decision to leave St. John’s. “It was fully determined on entering my name in the draft this year after the incredible season that I had,” Luis said. “That was always the main goal. I feel like the entire coaching staff was also on board with that decision. It was mutual.” Asked whether he’d fully digested that game, Luis described himself as “past that now.” “I feel like everything is in the past,” he said. “I have a great relationship with the coaches still. Just continue to put the work in.” 5 Zuby Ejiofor attempts a shot during the St. John’s game against Arkansas on March 22. Charles Wenzelberg That he flew back up to New York to accept the award, representing St. John’s while doing so, is an obvious sign that Luis still has a strong relationship with the university. Teammate Zuby Ejiofor, who will be back with the Johnnies next season as a senior, was there with Luis. “It’s one of many awards that RJ Luis has gotten this season,” Ejiofor said. “The man, he’s more than deserving of this award, he put in a lot of work. Just to see him overcoming adversity time and time again, to have the season that he did this past season, myself and everybody can say we wouldn’t have had the season we had without RJ Luis. For him to get this award, the amount of time he put in, really supportive of him.” Ejiofor will return to a largely overhauled roster, with a transfer portal class compiled by coach Rick Pitino that includes Bryce Hopkins , Ian Jackson , Joson Sanon , Oziyah Sellers and Dillon Mitchell . The Johnnies even added reigning Big Sky MVP Dylan Darling on Thursday. 5 Zuby Ejiofor is pictured during the MBWA All-Met Haggerty Awards on April 24. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post “Oziyah, he’s probably one of the best 3-point shooters in the country in my opinion,” Ejiofor said. “He just came in, he did the workout, he just blew the numbers. Dillon Mitchell, really athletic guy. Guy that can get into transition. Really special. Special player. Bryce Hopkins, we already know what he brings to the table, being a first-team All-[Big East]. He worked out as well, he was doing fine. Joson, another great shooter. “So we have a lot of great shooters. That was the main focal point for this season.

Today's Birthday Horoscope The friendships you form over the coming year will be friendships that last a lifetime, and one particular friendship could become the love match you have been waiting for. Don’t be afraid to let down your emotional guard. Love is always the highest power. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Aquarius Daily Horoscope January 20 - February 18 You need to get serious about your money situation because if you keep pretending that everything is fine you could find yourself in trouble very soon. Your most important aim must be to stem the outflow of cash. You can’t afford to buy everything! Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Pisces Daily Horoscope February 19 - March 20 Love planet Venus links with Saturn in your sign today, which could make it hard to express your feelings. You must make the effort though, because the number one person in your life needs to know how much you care – and it’s a lot. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Aries Daily Horoscope March 21 - April 19 People you expect to tell you the truth could be a bit evasive in their answers today. Maybe they don’t want to hurt your feelings, or maybe they have something to hide, but either way you will need to question what they tell you. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Taurus Daily Horoscope April 20 - May 20 If you hesitate for even a moment today you could miss out on the kind of opportunity that comes around all too rarely. The moment your instincts tell you that something will be good for you personally is the moment you must act. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Gemini Daily Horoscope May 21 - June 20 The most important thing now is that you act as if you have total confidence in your abilities. That may not be entirely true but people in positions of power don’t want to know you have doubts, they want to know you are up to the job. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Cancer Daily Horoscope June 21 - July 22 You may be of the opinion that you can do as you please but the planets warn you are fooling no one but yourself. A little bit of self-knowledge will go a long way today, so stop pretending you are invincible and keep your eyes open for trouble. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Leo Daily Horoscope July 23 - August 22 A business issue has reached a critical stage, so make sure that everything you say and do is positive. The best way to maintain the trust of the people you are dealing with is to show you believe in what you are doing 100 percent. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Virgo Daily Horoscope August 23 - September 22 It is inevitable that someone will let you down today but if your response to the situation is restrained and understanding it should not turn out to be such a big deal. What you cannot get done today you can still get done over the weekend. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Libra Daily Horoscope September 23 - October 22 If you let your imagination get the better of you over the next 24 hours you could end up disappointed when what you were hoping to occur fails to materialize. On the work front especially you must keep your feet on the ground. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Scorpio Daily Horoscope October 23 - November 21 There are two approaches you can take today if something goes wrong. You can look around for someone to blame or you can look at the situation dispassionately and work out what needs to be done to make sure it goes right next time. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Sagittarius Daily Horoscope November 22 - December 21 A clash of egos is likely today and the only way it will be resolved is by putting some distance between you and whoever it is who has rattled your cage. This is one of those occasions when compromise is neither desirable nor possible. Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Capricorn Daily Horoscope December 22 - January 19 It will become apparent today that someone whose views and opinions are very different to your own is not going to budge from their position. Like you they can be ridiculously stubborn, so don’t waste your time trying to convert them.

South Carolina star MiLaysia Fulwiley surprised the college basketball world when news broke of her entering the transfer portal, according to The Greenville News . The soon-to-be junior has been a staple for the Gamecocks for two seasons, coming off the bench for what has been one of the best teams in women’s college basketball. Fulwiley played an integral role in the team winning the 2024 national championship as well as in their run to a title game appearance this year. The 5-foot-10 standout was a key reserve for Dawn Staley and the Gamecocks, averaging 11.7 points per game each of her first two college seasons.

A native of Columbia, South Carolina, Fulwiley won SEC Tournament MVP as a freshman and earned All-SEC honors and was the Conference’s Sixth Player of the Year this past season. The dynamic guard has never averaged even 20 minutes per game. It appeared that Fulwiley’s playing time would continue to remain at the same level, given that teammate Raven Johnson announced she was returning to the school for the 2025-26 season, as well as the commitment of Ta’Niya Latson , who has transferred to the school from Florida State.

Wilson put together one of the worst performances from a quarterback you will see. He was 9-for-22 for 77 yards in the 10-3 defeat to the Patriots. The Jets had more punts than they did points. More punts than first downs. More punts than Wilson completions. You just cannot win football games with that kind of ineptitude from the most important position. The Patriots finally ran back the first punt for a TD this NFL season, doing it in the final seconds to take down the Jets. From a chance at first place at 7-3 to 6-4, last place in the AFC East and out of a playoff spot. What a sad turn of events.

Wilson put together one of the worst performances from a quarterback you will see. He was 9-for-22 for 77 yards in the 10-3 defeat to the Patriots. The Jets had more punts than they did points. More punts than first downs. More punts than Wilson completions. You just cannot win football games with that kind of ineptitude from the most important position. The Patriots finally ran back the first punt for a TD this NFL season, doing it in the final seconds to take down the Jets. From a chance at first place at 7-3 to 6-4, last place in the AFC East and out of a playoff spot. What a sad turn of events.

Getty Images Rick Pitino had upgraded St. John’s perimeter shooting, and now he has landed a defensive and rebounding weapon to pair with those offensive upgrades.

TRY IT NOW Dillion Mitchell, an elite athlete and former five-star high school prospect, is coming to Queens, the Cincinnati transfer told The Post on Wednesday morning. The 6-foot-8 jumping jack of a forward from Tampa is a significant addition as St. John’s looks to remain stout defensively while improving on the other end of the floor. Mitchell is an offensive rebounding dynamo, lob threat and versatile defender who can guard every position on the floor. “It was specifically about development and getting put into the right system around the right group of people who are going to push me, make me uncomfortable and just help me get to that next level,” Mitchell, who picked St. John’s over Ole Miss, told The Post. “One thing that stood out on my visit, when I sat down with [associate head coach Steve Masiello] and Coach Pitino, they just talked about my weaknesses. That was the biggest thing. I’ve been on visits before, and they just show you your strengths and show you all these highlights plays you make and how you can fit into their system. Them noticing my weaknesses and communicating how they can help me get better with my weaknesses, that was the main thing I was looking at.

Audio volume 11/14/2024 DougFNJ Been listening to Gangâs All Here for a few years, itâs always had good quality until this year. Just listening to todayâs episode, and the volume is all over the place. So as Iâm driving, it sounds like Coz is on a speaker phone sometimes talking across a room, sometimes a tunnel, sometimes like heâs turning his head away from the mic. The other guy 60% sounds fine, then sometimes his voice volume goes low, then BAM, loud and clear. So Iâm moving the volume up and down trying to hear it when itâs low, and almost blowing my speakers when these guys decide to speak into the mic for a minute. Cmon guys, upgrade the microphones, and definitely use headphones. Listen to your own podcast today and see how itâs working for you.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (“Arbitration Agreement”) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT. 19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (“Dispute”) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may arise out of such Dispute (each, an “Action”). The terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms. Each provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Covered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the “Parties”) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000. If a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York. 19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS CLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. Applicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State’s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (“FAA”). Choice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York. Informal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any  Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (“Informal Dispute Resolution Process”), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration. i. If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. ii. Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. iii. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. iv. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. v. If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. vi. Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. 19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS i. Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the “Arbitrator”). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users . Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby ii. Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. iii. Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. iv. Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party’s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. v. Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys’ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). vi. No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section.  Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. vii. Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. viii. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. 20. Miscellaneous.

These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. 21.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (“Arbitration Agreement”) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT. 19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (“Dispute”) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may arise out of such Dispute (each, an “Action”). The terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms. Each provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Covered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the “Parties”) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000. If a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York. 19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS CLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. Applicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State’s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (“FAA”). Choice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York. Informal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any  Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (“Informal Dispute Resolution Process”), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration. i. If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. ii. Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. iii. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. iv. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. v. If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. vi. Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. 19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS i. Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the “Arbitrator”). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users . Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users ii. Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. Arbitrator Selection. iii. Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. Rules Selection. iv. Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party’s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. Conduct of Arbitration. v. Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys’ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). Arbitration Costs. vi. No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section.  Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. No Opt Out Rights. vii. Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. viii. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.

These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. 21.

Bailey, who was named to the Big Ten all-Freshman Team and third-team all-Big Ten, is projected to go as high as third overall in the upcoming draft behind Duke’s Cooper Flagg and Rutgers teammate Dylan Harper , both of whom had already declared their draft intent. Bailey averaged 17.6 points per game, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks for a Scarlett Knights squad that finished 15-17 last season, despite having two of the projected highest picks in the upcoming draft on one team. The 6-foot-10 Bailey, who does not turn 19 until August and is one of the youngest prospects in this draft, has displayed exceptional shotmaking for a big forward.

Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post See Also new york knicks Knicks’ Game 3 report card: Ball movement and stars spark win DETROIT — The people started to file out of the arena, and still the damned Pistons wouldn’t go away. They kept making shots, long past the point where a comeback seemed reasonable. The folks at the scorer’s table even tried a little throwback to Munich 1972, giving the Pistons an extra chance to cash a miracle ticket, finagling the last five-tenths of a second accidentally (we think). “Shout out to the table,” Karl-Anthony Towns said with a laugh. The table wasn’t enough. The Knicks were going to survive three hours’ worth of some of the most intense, intensive playoff basketball we’ve seen around here in a while. The Knicks kept trying to pull away. The Pistons kept coming back. The crowd at Little Caesar’s Arena — all 20,062 of them — kept throwing some Trae Young-style venom at Jalen Brunson.

LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 145: EVALUATING THE 2023 GIANTS DRAFT CLASS FEAT. JOHN MICHAEL SCHMITZ May 1, 2023 The Giants hit a home run in the draft. They got their cornerback. They got their center. They got their wide receiver. Joe Schoen checked off a lot of boxes and Giants fans should be thrilled with the draft haul. Their second-round pick, John Michael Schmitz, is expected to be the starting center. He joined us on our post-draft episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We dissect the Giants’ picks and have a fun convo with Schmitz. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 144: ANALYZING THE GIANTS’ NFL DRAFT PLANS, OFFSEASON April 24, 2023 What will the Giants do with the 25th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft? Should they trade down? What will Joe Schoen do with their other nine picks? This team definitely has some holes to fill and this will be a critical draft coming off a trip to the NFC Divisional Round. Will Saquon Barkley be a part of the 2023 Giants and beyond? Lots of questions and the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London answer them all. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 143: GIANTS RE-SIGN DANIEL JONES TO MONSTER DEAL, TAG SAQUON BARKLEY March 8, 2023 Danny ($160 million) Dollars. Daniel Jones just got paid big time: $40 million a year, $160 million over four years. The Giants franchise QB is here to stay. Giants fans were left on the edge of their seat into the final minutes of the deadline to get it done Tuesday. Jones went out and had a career year and helped lead Big Blue to the playoffs. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 142: GIANTS SEASON IN REVIEW, OFFSEASON PREVIEW January 23, 2023 All good things come to an end. The Giants were not supposed to be in the NFC Divisional Round and coming off a road playoff win. They were supposed to be vacationing and preparing for free agency and the NFL draft. This team overachieved in every sense of the word, considering all the injuries it dealt with. It was a heck of a first season under head coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen. The culture has turned for the best and it seems the future is bright for Big Blue. That being said, this team was embarrassed in Philly . It was never in the game Saturday night. At halftime, the game felt over. The Giants did not look like they belonged on the same field as the Eagles in the playoffs or in the regular season when the starters played. While it was a season for Giants fans to be happy about, they need to go out and get better in the offseason if they want to overcome a much better Eagles team in the NFC East, where the Giants went a lowly 1-4-1 in the division. We have lots to cover on the season finale of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We will be back come free agency in March. Thanks to Andrew Harts for helping me produce the podcast all season. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 141: GIANTS-EAGLES BATTLE FOR NFC CHAMPIONSHIP FEAT. EVAN NEAL, JIHAD WARD January 19, 2023 Will the third time be the charm for the Giants? The Eagles have had Big Blue’s number for years. The Giants badly want to change that Saturday night in Philadelphia when the teams meet for a third time this season. This one feels different, though. The Giants are a much improved and healthier team from the first time they played the Eagles in December. And the last game of the season, they did not play their starters. This team is riding momentum and a QB that is playing at an elite level. This should be a primetime thriller in the City of Brotherly Love. To give an in-depth preview of the Giants-Eagles NFC Divisional Round playoff matchup, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Brandon London, Lawrence Tynes and Paul Schwartz. Brandon also spoke with Giants OL Evan Neal and LB Jihad Ward in the locker room after a practice this week. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 140: DANIEL JONES PROPELS GIANTS TO FIRST PLAYOFF WIN IN 11 YEARS January 16, 2023 Our way. That has been the Giants’ motto this season. They have been winning games their way. They did it again on Sunday in Minnesota. Daniel Jones put together a historic performance to propel Big Blue in his first career playoff game. He looked like a 10-year vet that had been there before, delivering balls to his receivers and using his legs to dominate the run game. He threw for 301 yards with two passing TDs and ran for 78 yards. Franchise QB. It’s on to Philadelphia for Brian Daboll’s bunch as they head to the Divisional Round Saturday for Part III against the Eagles. To react to the 31-24 win over the Vikings in the wild-card round and look ahead, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 139: GIANTS-VIKINGS WILD CARD PREVIEW FEAT. LANDON COLLINS, STERLING SHEPARD January 12, 2023 Many people believe even though the Giants may be underdogs going into Minnesota, they have a great chance of winning this playoff game. Will they pull off the upset in their first playoff appearance in six years? We bring you an in-depth Giants-Vikings Wild Card round preview on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Brandon also chats in the locker room with Landon Collins and Sterling Shepard. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 138: GIANTS’ BACKUPS SHOW FIGHT IN PHILLY, HEAD INTO PLAYOFFS HEALTHY January 9, 2023 None of us thought we would be getting ready for a Giants playoff game this week when the season started. This is Season 4 of the “Blue Rush” podcast and finally it has happened. Big Blue will gear up to play the Vikings in a wild-card playoff matchup in Minnesota at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday. They closed their season with all the backups getting a chance to play, including third-string QB Davis Webb. What an effort they got from Webb and company, fighting the NFC-leading Eagles to the final few minutes, falling 22-16. A bunch of backups showed grit in a game that meant nothing for the Giants and everything for the Eagles. Brian Daboll and the coaching staff have done an unbelievable job with this roster. But the job ain’t done yet. If the Giants lose in Minnesota on Sunday, sure it would still be considered a successful season…but that is definitely not the mentality this team has, nor should it. The Giants have a legit chance to beat the Vikings, who they nearly beat in Minnesota two weeks ago. They are playing with house money and you never know what will happen when the playoffs come around. Lawrence Tynes knows it well, being a part of two Giants Super Bowl championship teams that were heavy underdogs going into the postseason. Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown break down what we saw in Philly Sunday and look ahead to the Giants-Vikings playoff game on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 137: HOW SHOULD GIANTS APPROACH REGULAR SEASON FINALE IN PHILLY? January 5, 2023 To play or to not play? That is the question. The result of Sunday’s game means absolutely nothing on paper for the Giants. They are locked into the 6th seed in the NFC and are set to play whoever ends up being the No. 3 seed. Winning against the Eagles in Philadelphia could knock them out of winning the NFC East and demote them to the first wild-card spot. It could help their confidence heading into the playoffs. But at what risk? Do you risk one of your key players getting hurt and missing a playoff game? On a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London, the guys break down how the Giants should approach their regular season finale against the Eagles Sunday. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 136: JONES, GIANTS DOMINATE COLTS, CLINCH A PLAYOFF SPOT January 2, 2023 A year ago the Giants were kneeling multiple times as actual play calls…and were giving fans at MetLife Stadium a free medium Pepsi for the product they were watching. This time around, the Giants fans got to celebrate the clinching of a playoff spot in the final home game of the season. Giants fans are now all in, and rightfully so, on the Daniel Jones train. He has proven to everyone that he is the franchise QB and should be here for the long haul. Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen changed the culture of Giants football back to where it belongs. Six years later, the Giants are back in the postseason. We talk playoffs for the first time in the history of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 135: PREVIEWING THE GIANTS’ WIN-AND-IN GAME VS. COLTS December 29, 2022 Win and in. It’s that simple for the Giants on Sunday. For the first time since 2016, Big Blue can find themselves in the playoffs. They have the opportunity to do it in front of their home fans, giving them a long-awaited reason to celebrate. They can do it against a 4-10-1 Colts team that looks ready for the season to end and to hit a tropical island. To preview the game on Sunday, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 134: DANIEL JONES, GIANTS SHOW FIGHT IN LOSS TO VIKINGS December 24, 2022 The Giants may have fell short on Saturday in Minnesota, but boy did they put up one hell of a fight. This team was right there with the second best team in the NFC and really should have prevailed with a win. Daniel Jones keeps on proving to the doubters why the Giants should bring him back. He has shown grit and fight with not a ton of big names around him. Thanks to losses from the teams below them, the Giants are now in a win-and-in scenario against the Colts next Sunday at MetLife Stadium on the first day of 2023. To react to the 27-24 loss in the Vikings and where Big Blue stands, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Jake Brown. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 133: CAN REJUVENATED GIANTS TAKE DOWN VIKINGS IN MINNESOTA? December 22, 2022 The Giants are in prime position to make the playoffs. Even if they lose Saturday in Minnesota to the 11-3 Vikings, they are in good shape. But the Vikings have looked shaky and have won mostly one possession games. This is a winnable game, but will be a tough one in rowdy conditions. Can Big Blue win their second straight? To preview the game, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 132: PRIMETIME THIBODEAUX LEADS GIANTS TO HUGE WIN FEAT. TALKIN’ GIANTS December 19, 2022 “Prime time likes me.” Kayvon Thibodeaux was 100 percent right about that. The Giants rookie had the best game of his young career when the team needed it most Sunday night on the road against the Commanders. Twelve tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and recovery for a touchdown was the difference in the game. The Giants are now in a great position to make the playoffs. To react to the 20-12 win over the Commanders, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We had fun doing a crossover episode of the podcast with Justin Penik and Bobby Skinner from the “Talkin’ Giants” podcast. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 131: TOM COUGHLIN TALKS GIANTS MEMORIES, NEW BOOK “A GIANT WIN” December 15, 2022 Sunday’s Giants-Commanders matchup is essentially a playoff game for both teams. The winner has the upper hand on one of the final playoff spots in the NFC. The loser will have work to do and need some help. Can the Giants overcome the tie two weeks ago and prevail on the road? Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London have an in-depth preview of the game and make their predictions on the latest “Blue Rush” podcast. More importantly though, we are joined on the show by the legendary Giants head coach, two-time Super Bowl champion Tom Coughlin. The former Giants coach takes us down memory lane, revisiting the magical 2007 season and the run to a Super Bowl title, which he also details in his new book out now “A Giant Win.” LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 130: GIANTS EMBARRASSED BY EAGLES, BUT STILL CONTROL OWN DESTINY December 12, 2022 The Giants got their butts kicked on Sunday in their own building. The Eagles proved once again why they are the best team in the NFL right now. The Giants showed that they don’t deserve to make the playoffs. But they are still in a playoff spot right now. They can still redeem themselves, despite not winning a game in a month. They will need to right the ship next week against the Commanders. To break down what happened in Sunday’s 48-22 loss, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 129: GIANTS’ TOUGH TEST AHEAD AGAINST EAGLES FEAT. DAVE TOLLEFSON December 8, 2022 Sunday could get ugly for the Giants. They are winless in their last three games and coming off a lackluster tie against the Commanders. This week, it’s the NFL-best Eagles coming to MetLife Stadium to take on a Giants team limping their way into this game. They are battered and bruised and are just trying to scratch out a few wins to sneak into the playoffs. Getting one of those wins is unlikely against the 11-1 Eagles. To preview Giants-Eagles, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Two-time Giants Super Bowl champion Dave Tollefson stops by this week. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 128: GIANTS TIE COMMANDERS, WILL THEY STILL MAKE THE PLAYOFFS? December 5, 2022 Ties suck. The NFL needs to go back to 15-minute overtimes or figure out a way to not have games end in a tie. It’s a disservice to the fans, the players and everyone involved. With that said, the Giants can’t buy a victory right now. They are a downward spiral with still plenty of key injuries. But, they are still in a playoff spot. They still control their own destiny. To react to the strange 20-20 finish against the Commanders , we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 127: GIANTS BADLY NEED A WIN OVER COMMANDERS FEAT. ANDREW THOMAS December 1, 2022 Meaningful December football at MetLife Stadium. It’s been a while. The Giants’ matchup against the Commanders Sunday should be a playoff atmosphere between two division rivals duking it out for one of the final postseason spots in the NFC. The Commanders have won six of seven and Taylor Heinicke has them rolling. But the Giants have key players returning from injuries and that could be the big difference in their home building as they look to end their own losing streak. To preview the 7-4 Giants against the 7-5 Commanders, we bring you a new “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Brandon chats with Giants offensive tackle Andrew Thomas about the game and his stellar season. LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 126: WHERE DO 7-4 GIANTS STAND AFTER LOSS IN DALLAS? November 25, 2022 The Giants didn’t have much to work with in Dallas on Thursday. Essentially half their starters were out. They put up a fight, taking a lead into the third quarter, but the Cowboys had too much firepower on both sides of the ball. They got the help on two huge calls from the officials. All of that led to a 28-20 Giants loss to their NFC East rival , dropping their second straight game and falling to 7-4 on the season. Will the Giants crumble or will they still end up making the playoffs? We answer that and break down the Thanksgiving loss on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Brandon London and Jake Brown.

They got their cornerback. They got their center. They got their wide receiver. Joe Schoen checked off a lot of boxes and Giants fans should be thrilled with the draft haul. Their second-round pick, John Michael Schmitz, is expected to be the starting center. He joined us on our post-draft episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We dissect the Giants’ picks and have a fun convo with Schmitz.

This team definitely has some holes to fill and this will be a critical draft coming off a trip to the NFC Divisional Round. Will Saquon Barkley be a part of the 2023 Giants and beyond? Lots of questions and the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London answer them all.

Giants fans were left on the edge of their seat into the final minutes of the deadline to get it done Tuesday. Jones went out and had a career year and helped lead Big Blue to the playoffs.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 142: GIANTS SEASON IN REVIEW, OFFSEASON PREVIEW January 23, 2023 All good things come to an end. The Giants were not supposed to be in the NFC Divisional Round and coming off a road playoff win. They were supposed to be vacationing and preparing for free agency and the NFL draft. This team overachieved in every sense of the word, considering all the injuries it dealt with. It was a heck of a first season under head coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen. The culture has turned for the best and it seems the future is bright for Big Blue. That being said, this team was embarrassed in Philly . It was never in the game Saturday night. At halftime, the game felt over. The Giants did not look like they belonged on the same field as the Eagles in the playoffs or in the regular season when the starters played. While it was a season for Giants fans to be happy about, they need to go out and get better in the offseason if they want to overcome a much better Eagles team in the NFC East, where the Giants went a lowly 1-4-1 in the division. We have lots to cover on the season finale of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We will be back come free agency in March. Thanks to Andrew Harts for helping me produce the podcast all season.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 141: GIANTS-EAGLES BATTLE FOR NFC CHAMPIONSHIP FEAT. EVAN NEAL, JIHAD WARD January 19, 2023 Will the third time be the charm for the Giants? The Eagles have had Big Blue’s number for years. The Giants badly want to change that Saturday night in Philadelphia when the teams meet for a third time this season. This one feels different, though. The Giants are a much improved and healthier team from the first time they played the Eagles in December. And the last game of the season, they did not play their starters. This team is riding momentum and a QB that is playing at an elite level. This should be a primetime thriller in the City of Brotherly Love. To give an in-depth preview of the Giants-Eagles NFC Divisional Round playoff matchup, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Brandon London, Lawrence Tynes and Paul Schwartz. Brandon also spoke with Giants OL Evan Neal and LB Jihad Ward in the locker room after a practice this week.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 140: DANIEL JONES PROPELS GIANTS TO FIRST PLAYOFF WIN IN 11 YEARS January 16, 2023 Our way. That has been the Giants’ motto this season. They have been winning games their way. They did it again on Sunday in Minnesota. Daniel Jones put together a historic performance to propel Big Blue in his first career playoff game. He looked like a 10-year vet that had been there before, delivering balls to his receivers and using his legs to dominate the run game. He threw for 301 yards with two passing TDs and ran for 78 yards. Franchise QB. It’s on to Philadelphia for Brian Daboll’s bunch as they head to the Divisional Round Saturday for Part III against the Eagles. To react to the 31-24 win over the Vikings in the wild-card round and look ahead, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 139: GIANTS-VIKINGS WILD CARD PREVIEW FEAT. LANDON COLLINS, STERLING SHEPARD January 12, 2023 Many people believe even though the Giants may be underdogs going into Minnesota, they have a great chance of winning this playoff game. Will they pull off the upset in their first playoff appearance in six years? We bring you an in-depth Giants-Vikings Wild Card round preview on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Brandon also chats in the locker room with Landon Collins and Sterling Shepard.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 138: GIANTS’ BACKUPS SHOW FIGHT IN PHILLY, HEAD INTO PLAYOFFS HEALTHY January 9, 2023 None of us thought we would be getting ready for a Giants playoff game this week when the season started. This is Season 4 of the “Blue Rush” podcast and finally it has happened. Big Blue will gear up to play the Vikings in a wild-card playoff matchup in Minnesota at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday. They closed their season with all the backups getting a chance to play, including third-string QB Davis Webb. What an effort they got from Webb and company, fighting the NFC-leading Eagles to the final few minutes, falling 22-16. A bunch of backups showed grit in a game that meant nothing for the Giants and everything for the Eagles. Brian Daboll and the coaching staff have done an unbelievable job with this roster. But the job ain’t done yet. If the Giants lose in Minnesota on Sunday, sure it would still be considered a successful season…but that is definitely not the mentality this team has, nor should it. The Giants have a legit chance to beat the Vikings, who they nearly beat in Minnesota two weeks ago. They are playing with house money and you never know what will happen when the playoffs come around. Lawrence Tynes knows it well, being a part of two Giants Super Bowl championship teams that were heavy underdogs going into the postseason. Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown break down what we saw in Philly Sunday and look ahead to the Giants-Vikings playoff game on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 137: HOW SHOULD GIANTS APPROACH REGULAR SEASON FINALE IN PHILLY? January 5, 2023 To play or to not play? That is the question. The result of Sunday’s game means absolutely nothing on paper for the Giants. They are locked into the 6th seed in the NFC and are set to play whoever ends up being the No. 3 seed. Winning against the Eagles in Philadelphia could knock them out of winning the NFC East and demote them to the first wild-card spot. It could help their confidence heading into the playoffs. But at what risk? Do you risk one of your key players getting hurt and missing a playoff game? On a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London, the guys break down how the Giants should approach their regular season finale against the Eagles Sunday.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 136: JONES, GIANTS DOMINATE COLTS, CLINCH A PLAYOFF SPOT January 2, 2023 A year ago the Giants were kneeling multiple times as actual play calls…and were giving fans at MetLife Stadium a free medium Pepsi for the product they were watching. This time around, the Giants fans got to celebrate the clinching of a playoff spot in the final home game of the season. Giants fans are now all in, and rightfully so, on the Daniel Jones train. He has proven to everyone that he is the franchise QB and should be here for the long haul. Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen changed the culture of Giants football back to where it belongs. Six years later, the Giants are back in the postseason. We talk playoffs for the first time in the history of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz, Brandon London and Jake Brown.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 135: PREVIEWING THE GIANTS’ WIN-AND-IN GAME VS. COLTS December 29, 2022 Win and in. It’s that simple for the Giants on Sunday. For the first time since 2016, Big Blue can find themselves in the playoffs. They have the opportunity to do it in front of their home fans, giving them a long-awaited reason to celebrate. They can do it against a 4-10-1 Colts team that looks ready for the season to end and to hit a tropical island. To preview the game on Sunday, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 134: DANIEL JONES, GIANTS SHOW FIGHT IN LOSS TO VIKINGS December 24, 2022 The Giants may have fell short on Saturday in Minnesota, but boy did they put up one hell of a fight. This team was right there with the second best team in the NFC and really should have prevailed with a win. Daniel Jones keeps on proving to the doubters why the Giants should bring him back. He has shown grit and fight with not a ton of big names around him. Thanks to losses from the teams below them, the Giants are now in a win-and-in scenario against the Colts next Sunday at MetLife Stadium on the first day of 2023. To react to the 27-24 loss in the Vikings and where Big Blue stands, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Jake Brown.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 133: CAN REJUVENATED GIANTS TAKE DOWN VIKINGS IN MINNESOTA? December 22, 2022 The Giants are in prime position to make the playoffs. Even if they lose Saturday in Minnesota to the 11-3 Vikings, they are in good shape. But the Vikings have looked shaky and have won mostly one possession games. This is a winnable game, but will be a tough one in rowdy conditions. Can Big Blue win their second straight? To preview the game, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 132: PRIMETIME THIBODEAUX LEADS GIANTS TO HUGE WIN FEAT. TALKIN’ GIANTS December 19, 2022 “Prime time likes me.” Kayvon Thibodeaux was 100 percent right about that. The Giants rookie had the best game of his young career when the team needed it most Sunday night on the road against the Commanders. Twelve tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and recovery for a touchdown was the difference in the game. The Giants are now in a great position to make the playoffs. To react to the 20-12 win over the Commanders, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Brandon London and Jake Brown. We had fun doing a crossover episode of the podcast with Justin Penik and Bobby Skinner from the “Talkin’ Giants” podcast.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 131: TOM COUGHLIN TALKS GIANTS MEMORIES, NEW BOOK “A GIANT WIN” December 15, 2022 Sunday’s Giants-Commanders matchup is essentially a playoff game for both teams. The winner has the upper hand on one of the final playoff spots in the NFC. The loser will have work to do and need some help. Can the Giants overcome the tie two weeks ago and prevail on the road? Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London have an in-depth preview of the game and make their predictions on the latest “Blue Rush” podcast. More importantly though, we are joined on the show by the legendary Giants head coach, two-time Super Bowl champion Tom Coughlin. The former Giants coach takes us down memory lane, revisiting the magical 2007 season and the run to a Super Bowl title, which he also details in his new book out now “A Giant Win.”  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 130: GIANTS EMBARRASSED BY EAGLES, BUT STILL CONTROL OWN DESTINY December 12, 2022 The Giants got their butts kicked on Sunday in their own building. The Eagles proved once again why they are the best team in the NFL right now. The Giants showed that they don’t deserve to make the playoffs. But they are still in a playoff spot right now. They can still redeem themselves, despite not winning a game in a month. They will need to right the ship next week against the Commanders. To break down what happened in Sunday’s 48-22 loss, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 129: GIANTS’ TOUGH TEST AHEAD AGAINST EAGLES FEAT. DAVE TOLLEFSON December 8, 2022 Sunday could get ugly for the Giants. They are winless in their last three games and coming off a lackluster tie against the Commanders. This week, it’s the NFL-best Eagles coming to MetLife Stadium to take on a Giants team limping their way into this game. They are battered and bruised and are just trying to scratch out a few wins to sneak into the playoffs. Getting one of those wins is unlikely against the 11-1 Eagles. To preview Giants-Eagles, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Two-time Giants Super Bowl champion Dave Tollefson stops by this week.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 128: GIANTS TIE COMMANDERS, WILL THEY STILL MAKE THE PLAYOFFS? December 5, 2022 Ties suck. The NFL needs to go back to 15-minute overtimes or figure out a way to not have games end in a tie. It’s a disservice to the fans, the players and everyone involved. With that said, the Giants can’t buy a victory right now. They are a downward spiral with still plenty of key injuries. But, they are still in a playoff spot. They still control their own destiny. To react to the strange 20-20 finish against the Commanders , we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 127: GIANTS BADLY NEED A WIN OVER COMMANDERS FEAT. ANDREW THOMAS December 1, 2022 Meaningful December football at MetLife Stadium. It’s been a while. The Giants’ matchup against the Commanders Sunday should be a playoff atmosphere between two division rivals duking it out for one of the final postseason spots in the NFC. The Commanders have won six of seven and Taylor Heinicke has them rolling. But the Giants have key players returning from injuries and that could be the big difference in their home building as they look to end their own losing streak. To preview the 7-4 Giants against the 7-5 Commanders, we bring you a new “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Paul Schwartz and Brandon London. Brandon chats with Giants offensive tackle Andrew Thomas about the game and his stellar season.  LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Amazon Music EPISODE 126: WHERE DO 7-4 GIANTS STAND AFTER LOSS IN DALLAS? November 25, 2022 The Giants didn’t have much to work with in Dallas on Thursday. Essentially half their starters were out. They put up a fight, taking a lead into the third quarter, but the Cowboys had too much firepower on both sides of the ball. They got the help on two huge calls from the officials. All of that led to a 28-20 Giants loss to their NFC East rival , dropping their second straight game and falling to 7-4 on the season. Will the Giants crumble or will they still end up making the playoffs? We answer that and break down the Thanksgiving loss on a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes, Brandon London and Jake Brown.

Atlas Itâs amazing this podcast was started as the Knicks began their unexpected turnaround and breakout season culminating in their first playoff appearance in a decade and their first shot at winning a round (or even a game) in even longer. Itâs almost like Sal, Producer Jake, and the inimitable JYD are the reason for the season. A fun listen every week. Insightful reflections and great guests. Serve with steak, but not Sizzler.

Butâ¦ 3d ago Christopher J 007 As I posted last season, I always enjoy this excellent podcast! Larry Brooks is great. However, the episodes tend to be on the shorter side; and I am very disappointed that the episodes do not drop on a predictable schedule. The show does not appear to be a priority of the host and co-hosts. The episodes should drop on the same day most weeks as other NYR podcasts do. Enough with the pauses and delays at the height of the season. Also, the show could have continued during the Four Nations tournament. Like this seasonâs Rangers, itâs time to up the level of commitment level. Now we are the end of the season and a new episode hasnât dropped since April 10. Excellent Podcast!

The couple announced the big news in posts on Cavinder’s social media accounts, with the 24-year-old showing off her new bling in a photo on her Instagram Story where she’s standing on the beach in front of a large floral arrangement.

In order for the Blueshirts to make another deep playoff run — following a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals last season — they need the dominant Shesterkin.

TRY IT NOW St. John’s is losing one of its top returning players with eligibility left. Sophomore guard Simeon Wilcher, a key part of coach Rick Pitino’s first recruiting class, entered the transfer portal Friday, he told The Post.

US News Fury as Minneapolis’ ‘woke’ DA Mary Moriarty allows accused rapists and killers to stay free — too much even for Soros-backed AG By Olivia Land Published Oct. 3, 2023, 10:19 a.m. ET Explore More Yet again, Kathy Hochul is losing big-time on her budget plan and criminal justice ‘fixes’ Progressives’ pro-crime discovery law lets abusers walk scot-free Long Island DA reveals 3 twisted ‘rules’ that made MS-13 a plague in the suburbs — ‘biggest, baddest, most violent gang’ Minneapolis’ progressive district attorney is under fire for her woke policies that allow accused rapists, pedophiles and killers to stay free — with even Minnesota’s George Soros-backed general attorney accusing her of taking it too far. Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty, 59, took office in January promising to “deliver more safety and more justice” to the community. Since then, however, she has horrified local families and officials by pushing for suspects in even the most serious crimes to get probation in an effort to keep them out of prison, according to the Star Tribune . Veteran prosecutor Catherine Markey was only told moments before a plea hearing that the DA was only seeking probation for one of the teens involved in the 2019 carjacking that killed her son, Stephen Markey. “It’s a trend definitely because of Mary Moriarty,” the former prosecutor told the paper of those accused of serious crimes getting slap-on-the-wrist deals. “She’s still playing public defender — the only thing is, that’s not her role anymore,” Markey said of the city’s chief prosecutor. 8 Keith Ellison, attorney general for Minnesota, has criticized Moriarty’s decisions. Getty Images for National Urban League 8 Mary Moriarty took office as district attorney of Hennepin County in January. AP Sherrice Barnett similarly recalled her horror at being told the teen charged with murdering her 27-year-old son, Derrell Freeman, would be spared a prison sentence. “I couldn’t breathe,” she told the paper. “I said, ‘I just got to get up out of here.’ I never would have imagined in a million years that it would have went that way.” Another mom, Nancy Caspersen, recalled her disgust at the repeat offender charged with the third-degree murder of her daughter, Kailey — for selling her the pain pills laced with fentanyl that killed her in 2021 — getting probation and up to 240 days in jail instead of the maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. “It ain’t fair. It’s not right. She’s my only child,” Caspersen tearfully told the Star Tribune. “It makes me feel like she didn’t matter to these people.” 8 Stephen Markey (right) was gunned down during a carjacking in 2019. Courtesy of Markey family Moriarty faced outrage from her very first week in office, when she dropped the charges against a 35-year-old man accused of raping a teen girl due to attorney misconduct, CBS News reported at the time. Moriarty said then that she was “deeply remorseful and apologetic” to the alleged victim, who endured taxing testimony before the charges were dismissed, the outlet noted. However, critics suggest it was the start of a trend that has only escalated since — with some high-profile cases even taken off her hands. In April, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz reassigned the case against the alleged murderers of mother of one Zaria McKeever to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is backed by left-wing billionaire George Soros, the Star Tribune explained. McKeever, 23, was killed in 2022 by two teen brothers hired by her ex-boyfriend, the outlet said. 8 Zaria McKeever, 23, was murdered last year on orders from her ex-boyfriend. Ellison is overseeing the case. Facebook While prosecutors initially wanted to try both boys as adults, they were offered probationary deals in exchange for testimony against McKeever’s ex. The controversial arrangement prompted Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Leah Erickson to remove herself from the case, then leave the office entirely, the Star Tribune reported at the time. Ellison called Moriarty’s approach to the McKeever case “disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime” in a statement shortly after the case was reassigned. “While I share the belief that too many juveniles are involved in the adult criminal justice system, accountability for the seriousness of this crime has been missing in this case,” he wrote. McKeever’s sister, Tiffynie Epps, was more direct, telling the Star Tribune, “[Moriarty] is fumbling another case yet again and again and again.” 8 Husayn Braveheart is receiving probation for gunning down Stephen Markey. Minneapolis Police Department “Something needs to happen. … It’s not about it going our way. It’s about going the right way.” Similarly, the case of a 15-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by a relative for three years prompted prosecutor Raina Urton to remove herself from the case after the new administration pushed her to seek probation instead of prison for the defendant, the outlet said. “She walked away because she knows what happened was wrong,” the teen’s mother said of Urton. “She was fighting for us. She was fighting for our daughter.” Stephen Markey’s parents — who were flabbergasted when Husayn Braveheart, one of the teens accused of gunning down the 39-year-old paralegal four years ago, was offered probation after the first got 22 years behind bars — asked Ellison to take over their son’s case. Ellison, however, announced last week that he would not intervene. 8 Jesse Russell Lietzau got probation for selling Nancy Caspersen’s daughter deadly fentanyl-laced pills. Ramsey County Sheriff's Office Catherine Markey subsequently filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Crime Victim Justice Unit, the Star Tribune said. Moriarty says she plans to stick with her plan to bring reform to the DA’s office — dismissing the anger as the expected cost of change. “I think it takes a lot of courage actually to act upon what you say you’re going to do,” she told the Star Tribune. “I knew we would get a lot of pushback. “But if you’re truly going to make change, if you truly are about your values, and you want to have integrity, and you believe in research and look at the data, these are the right decisions and I stand by them.” Moriarty campaigned on the premise of increasing rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration for young offenders, she explained. 8 Moriarty insists that she is sticking by her principles. Mary Moriarty/Facebook In the case of Derrell Freeman’s killing, she continued, the two perpetrators are being treated differently based on their records: One, Joran McFarland, will likely see adult prison time, while Monte Wise could receive up to two years of treatment and be on probation until he is 21. “All of us have been conditioned to believe that the value that we place on a loved one’s life is the length of the prison sentence that they get,” Moriarty noted of the families’ reactions to her sentencing requests. The former chief public defender is illustrative of the new brand of progressive prosecutor intent on dismantling the various injustices within mass incarceration and criminal justice, City University of New York School of Law professor Steve Zeidman told the Star Tribune. “You’re seen as being overly lenient as opposed to trying to correct past wrongs,” he said of Moriarty and her peers. 8 Caspersen’s daughter, Kailey, died from a fentanyl overdose in May 2021. Digital Memorial He noted that several of the cases that elicited complaints from families started under former County Attorney Mike Freeman, whose office reassured loved ones that they were seeking prison time. While there perhaps should be better communication between the DA and families, Zeidman mused, Moriarty does not need to feel bound by the statements of a previous administration. “That’s a sea change in the office,” Moriarty acknowledged. “And I understand why families are upset. I understand why some in the community are upset because we have not done a good job of having this conversation.” “We’re working towards building that out because families do deserve more. They deserve more even if a person goes to prison.” Filed under district attorneys minneapolis minnesota prosecutors woke culture 10/3/23 Read Next Trending Now in US News This story has been shared 58,683 times. 58,683 LI hospital chair fired hours after revealing thieves stole FBI probe docs from his home in growing scandal: 'Hochul wanted my head' This story has been shared 44,661 times. 44,661 PhD student goes viral for turning down 'dream' NASA internship for this woke reason This story has been shared 32,421 times. 32,421 See Karen Read’s sweeping text fight with boyfriend hours before his death read to stunned jury This story has been shared 24,857 times. 24,857 Good Samaritans save Florida mother, two small children from attempted kidnapper in dramatic video Most Commented Join the conversation This story has 3K comments. 3K Fed-up Trump blasts Putin after Russia's deadliest attack on Ukraine in nearly a year, hampering peace talks: 'Vladimir, STOP!'

Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty, 59, took office in January promising to “deliver more safety and more justice” to the community. Since then, however, she has horrified local families and officials by pushing for suspects in even the most serious crimes to get probation in an effort to keep them out of prison, according to the Star Tribune . Veteran prosecutor Catherine Markey was only told moments before a plea hearing that the DA was only seeking probation for one of the teens involved in the 2019 carjacking that killed her son, Stephen Markey. “It’s a trend definitely because of Mary Moriarty,” the former prosecutor told the paper of those accused of serious crimes getting slap-on-the-wrist deals. “She’s still playing public defender — the only thing is, that’s not her role anymore,” Markey said of the city’s chief prosecutor. 8 8 8 Getty Images for National Urban League 8 8 8 AP Sherrice Barnett similarly recalled her horror at being told the teen charged with murdering her 27-year-old son, Derrell Freeman, would be spared a prison sentence. “I couldn’t breathe,” she told the paper. “I said, ‘I just got to get up out of here.’ I never would have imagined in a million years that it would have went that way.” Another mom, Nancy Caspersen, recalled her disgust at the repeat offender charged with the third-degree murder of her daughter, Kailey — for selling her the pain pills laced with fentanyl that killed her in 2021 — getting probation and up to 240 days in jail instead of the maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. “It ain’t fair. It’s not right. She’s my only child,” Caspersen tearfully told the Star Tribune. “It makes me feel like she didn’t matter to these people.” 8 8 8 Courtesy of Markey family Moriarty faced outrage from her very first week in office, when she dropped the charges against a 35-year-old man accused of raping a teen girl due to attorney misconduct, CBS News reported at the time. Moriarty said then that she was “deeply remorseful and apologetic” to the alleged victim, who endured taxing testimony before the charges were dismissed, the outlet noted. However, critics suggest it was the start of a trend that has only escalated since — with some high-profile cases even taken off her hands. In April, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz reassigned the case against the alleged murderers of mother of one Zaria McKeever to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is backed by left-wing billionaire George Soros, the Star Tribune explained. McKeever, 23, was killed in 2022 by two teen brothers hired by her ex-boyfriend, the outlet said. 8 8 8 Facebook While prosecutors initially wanted to try both boys as adults, they were offered probationary deals in exchange for testimony against McKeever’s ex. The controversial arrangement prompted Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Leah Erickson to remove herself from the case, then leave the office entirely, the Star Tribune reported at the time. Ellison called Moriarty’s approach to the McKeever case “disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime” in a statement shortly after the case was reassigned. “While I share the belief that too many juveniles are involved in the adult criminal justice system, accountability for the seriousness of this crime has been missing in this case,” he wrote. McKeever’s sister, Tiffynie Epps, was more direct, telling the Star Tribune, “[Moriarty] is fumbling another case yet again and again and again.” 8 8 8 Minneapolis Police Department “Something needs to happen. … It’s not about it going our way. It’s about going the right way.” Similarly, the case of a 15-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by a relative for three years prompted prosecutor Raina Urton to remove herself from the case after the new administration pushed her to seek probation instead of prison for the defendant, the outlet said. “She walked away because she knows what happened was wrong,” the teen’s mother said of Urton. “She was fighting for us.

The 38-year-old victim — a “transit recidivist” criminal with more than 60 prior arrests — was riding a Brooklyn-bound No. 5 train when another commuter stepped on his feet around 8:40 a.m., according to authorities and sources. The victim then flew into a rage, calling the shoe-stepper a gay slur, sources said. That’s when the other man turned violent and stabbed him, according to the sources. 4 A person was stabbed at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station on April 25, 2025. Michael Nagle When the feuding pair got off the train at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station downtown, the wounded man chased after the alleged stabber — who then knifed him again, the sources said.

George Santos sobs as he learns his fate at sentencing in corruption case LI hospital chair fired hours after revealing thieves stole FBI probe docs from his home in growing scandal: 'Hochul wanted my head' Cops found the victim — later identified as Fort Greene, Brooklyn, resident Sheldon John — unconscious and unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to the torso, police said. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he later succumbed to his grave injuries, cops said. His name has not been officially released by the NYPD pending family notification. The attacker, also believed to be in his 30s, ran off and was still on the loose later Friday. Sources say he initially got on the train at Grand Central-42nd Street, and was last seen wearing all black. A 27-year-old city worker who comes into the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station on her daily morning commute to work said she saw two people fighting — and then saw the victim fall “head first on the ground.” 4 An NYPD officer at the scene of the stabbing. Michael Nagle “When I got to him, I immediately called 911, because he looked unconscious and he was bleeding,” said the witness, who did not want to be identified. “But he definitely hit his head, head-first on the ground, and his eyes were rolling around. It seemed like he had a concussion or [something].” She said it was “sad” to see no one else stepping in to help him – as other morning commuters simply stood around and took their phones out. “You don’t know whose son is that. You want to make sure you get help as soon as possible,” she said “The subway is not safe, I’ve always seen some crazy stuff, but that was a lot — seeing someone bleeding and unconscious,” the woman said. “But seeing that early in the morning, at 8 a.m., that was a lot to see.” Trains were not stopping on the downtown side of the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station for hours after the deadly attack. By the late morning, detectives and police officers were milling around as a heap of bloody tissues, blood stains, and a black piece of clothing lay on the downtown platform. 4 The attacker is believed to be in his 30s and was last seen wearing all black. NYPD “We need to be careful on the subway these days,” said Youness Aehet, 25, a technician who lives in Brooklyn and was inside the station in the aftermath of the attack. “They need to put something on the trains [metal detectors]. Maybe more cameras. We don’t feel safe on the subway any more.” The latest NYPD data, updated Sunday, show felony crime overall in the subway system was down about 11%  – with 589 incidents reported compared to 661 during the same period last year. While murders, robberies, burglaries and grand larcenies are all down so far this year, felony assaults saw about a 9% spike – with 183 such crimes reported compared to 168 in 2024. Rapes were also up, with four reported in the system so far in 2025 compared to two at this time last year, the statistics show. According to the data, Friday’s deadly stabbing was the first homicide in the subway system of 2025. 4 Paramedics respond to a subway stabbing in NYC. The victim in the shocking slay was last arrested on Feb. 6 at One Penn Plaza for allegedly chasing down and trying to punch a person who refused to buy MetroCard swipes from him, sources said. The victim was last arrested on Feb. 6 of this year at 1 Penn Plaza for allegedly chasing down and trying to punch a person who refused to buy MetroCard swipes from him, sources said. While in police custody, he allegedly kicked a cop in the knee, according to the sources. The disposition of that case was not immediately known. In an afternoon press conference outside the station, Jack Nierenberg, vice president of the transportation advocacy group Passengers United, said the victim’s rap sheet points to “another failure with the system.” “There needs to be serious reforms to the bail laws, giving the judges the proper jurisdiction that they need to actually handle these violent crimes that come into their courtrooms,” Nierenberg said. As for the suspect, he added that there was “no excuse” for someone to carry a knife in the subway system. “The MTA and our city and state elected officials really need to start taking the responsibility and hold themselves accountable and actually take proactive action that they should have been taking for so long now,” he added. “Subway riders don’t feel safe because they aren’t safe right now.” Charlton D’souza, president of Passengers United, said that violence has “become the normal” in the city. “Everyone has become relaxed to this, and this is not what should happen,” he added. “And this crime happened right under City Hall. “We‘be given up on the elected officials in New York City. They’re useless,” D’souza said. “They’re not doing anything, and every time a crime happens, they’ll tell us, oh, the crime stats are down. All they’re doing is comparing the statistics from last year to this year.

The 38-year-old victim — a “transit recidivist” criminal with more than 60 prior arrests — was riding a Brooklyn-bound No. 5 train when another commuter stepped on his feet around 8:40 a.m., according to authorities and sources. The victim then flew into a rage, calling the shoe-stepper a gay slur, sources said. That’s when the other man turned violent and stabbed him, according to the sources. 4 4 4 Michael Nagle When the feuding pair got off the train at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station downtown, the wounded man chased after the alleged stabber — who then knifed him again, the sources said.

George Santos sobs as he learns his fate at sentencing in corruption case LI hospital chair fired hours after revealing thieves stole FBI probe docs from his home in growing scandal: 'Hochul wanted my head' Cops found the victim — later identified as Fort Greene, Brooklyn, resident Sheldon John — unconscious and unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to the torso, police said. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he later succumbed to his grave injuries, cops said. His name has not been officially released by the NYPD pending family notification. The attacker, also believed to be in his 30s, ran off and was still on the loose later Friday. Sources say he initially got on the train at Grand Central-42nd Street, and was last seen wearing all black. A 27-year-old city worker who comes into the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station on her daily morning commute to work said she saw two people fighting — and then saw the victim fall “head first on the ground.” 4 4 4 Michael Nagle “When I got to him, I immediately called 911, because he looked unconscious and he was bleeding,” said the witness, who did not want to be identified. “But he definitely hit his head, head-first on the ground, and his eyes were rolling around. It seemed like he had a concussion or [something].” She said it was “sad” to see no one else stepping in to help him – as other morning commuters simply stood around and took their phones out. “You don’t know whose son is that. You want to make sure you get help as soon as possible,” she said “The subway is not safe, I’ve always seen some crazy stuff, but that was a lot — seeing someone bleeding and unconscious,” the woman said. “But seeing that early in the morning, at 8 a.m., that was a lot to see.” Trains were not stopping on the downtown side of the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station for hours after the deadly attack. By the late morning, detectives and police officers were milling around as a heap of bloody tissues, blood stains, and a black piece of clothing lay on the downtown platform. 4 4 4 NYPD “We need to be careful on the subway these days,” said Youness Aehet, 25, a technician who lives in Brooklyn and was inside the station in the aftermath of the attack. “They need to put something on the trains [metal detectors]. Maybe more cameras. We don’t feel safe on the subway any more.” The latest NYPD data, updated Sunday, show felony crime overall in the subway system was down about 11%  – with 589 incidents reported compared to 661 during the same period last year. While murders, robberies, burglaries and grand larcenies are all down so far this year, felony assaults saw about a 9% spike – with 183 such crimes reported compared to 168 in 2024. Rapes were also up, with four reported in the system so far in 2025 compared to two at this time last year, the statistics show. According to the data, Friday’s deadly stabbing was the first homicide in the subway system of 2025. 4 4 4 The victim in the shocking slay was last arrested on Feb. 6 at One Penn Plaza for allegedly chasing down and trying to punch a person who refused to buy MetroCard swipes from him, sources said. The victim was last arrested on Feb. 6 of this year at 1 Penn Plaza for allegedly chasing down and trying to punch a person who refused to buy MetroCard swipes from him, sources said.

Kennedy Jr ., abruptly announced his exit from the online outlet — wildly trashing its weak coverage while asking for money for his new venture. In his first post for his new “Telos News” Substack, Lizza said he had “recently left” the publication because he believed “their style of political coverage is not meeting the unprecedented moment of democratic peril we are facing.” “This publication is my earnest attempt to cover the crisis in Washington with a clear-eyed understanding of what is actually happening,” wrote Lizza, who had been Politico’s chief Washington correspondent since 2019. 4 Politico’s former top reporter Ryan Lizza, whose ex-fiancé Olivia Nuzzi was embroiled in a sexting scandal with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said he was leaving the outlet. Instagram/@olivianuzzix He noted the new venture would be funded solely by readers — as he called on them to pay for subscriptions to help boost it up. “I have never written a fundraising appeal, and just typing this paragraph is deeply cringe-inducing for me.

Getty Images “I saw up close how easy it was for a media conglomerate to grovel before the Trump administration when the wrong people are in charge,” he wrote. Lizza ripped the outlet for opting to send one of its reporters to be an onstage guest at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) after Trump “attacked Politico for selling subscriptions to the federal government.” He described the conference as a “sewer of media bashing and cheerleading for the degradation of our democracy where some activists were publicly organizing an unconstitutional third term for Trump — in other words, a coup.” “A friend of mine who served in Iraq once tried to explain to me how psychologically disorienting warfare can be for soldiers the first time they’re in full-scale combat. It’s so horrific, so unlike any human experience, that the initial instinct is to deny that what’s happening is actually happening,” Lizza said. 4 Lizza’s ex-fiancée was embroiled in a sexting scandal with now-HHS Secretary RFK Jr. ZUMAPRESS.com “That’s the psychology that has seized many newsrooms, law firms, and other elite institutions in Washington for months.

Daniela Lucas, a 26-year-old bioengineering student at UC San Diego, recently uploaded a TikTok video showing her dramatically selecting “Decline Offer” for an internship in NASA’s Human Health and Performance program. “No one tells you how hard it is to reject an offer from your dream internship at NASA because of the current administration,” Lucas, 26, wrote over the video. 3 Daniela Lucas said she spent “years” pursuing a NASA internship, only to turn it down. Daniela Lucas/LinkedIn “I worked years to receive this letter, just to have to decline,” she added, including a crying face and devil emoji. Weepy piano music played over the video, as Lucas clutched at her face and then shook her head, looking incredulous.

US News Karen Read’s sweeping text fight with boyfriend hours before his death read to stunned jury: ‘You’ve really hurt me this time’ By Daryl Khan Published April 24, 2025 Updated April 24, 2025, 6:46 p.m. ET Karen Read and boyfriend John O’Keefe had a bitter fight over text just hours before the Boston cop’s lifeless body was pulled out of the snow — and a stunned jury heard the entire exchange Thursday as Read sat stone-faced. The acrimonious exchange was recited in a matter-of-fact monotone by a Massachusetts state trooper during an action-packed day, the third in a sensational murder trial playing out in a Massachusetts criminal court. The texts, between 2:30 p.m. and 8:35 p.m. Jan. 28 2022, were introduced in the last trial — which ended in a mistrial — but this is the first time a jury heard them play out in one continuous exchange. 6 Exclusive: Karen Read seen in Dedham, Mass., after court on April 24, 2025.

Read and the jury watched the screen as State Trooper Nicholas Guarino re-enacted the text fight from the stand. 6 The text messages between Read and O’Keefe were introduced at her previous trial, but this time the jury heard them read in court. Courtesy of David Yannetti 6 Read listening to testimony during her trial on April 24, 2025. AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool “I’m sorry,” O’Keefe writes back, according to Boston 25 News. “This has been an issue w me for 8 years. It physically hurts me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I’m forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy.” Read wonders about their future, and accuses O’Keefe of having a wandering eye and having interest in another woman. “Tell me if you are interested in someone else. Can’t think of any other reason you’ve been like this,” she writes to her beau. He responds, “Nope” and then “Things haven’t been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that? Kids are here. Not in the mood to talk.” Want to learn more about Karen Read’s murder trial?

O’Keefe responds that he is sick of fighting “weekly for several months now.” “So yeh I’m not as quick to jump into being lovie dovie as you apparently,” he adds. He then texts Read, “Omg!! Stop calling.” 6 State Trooper Nicholas Guarino testifying in the Read trial on April 24, 2025. AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool Read’s blank, expressionless face was lit by the glow from the screen as Guarino continued to recite the tense exchange. The rapt jurors followed along as well. After a few phone calls between the two, one of which O’Keefe declines to answer, the text fight continues. “I’m going to grab a drink in a bit. Can you pls answer??” Read sends. O’Keefe writes back, “No Karen. Not sure why you need to announce that you’re grabbing a drink but have fun.” What to know about the Karen Read murder case Karen Read, 44, was charged with second-degree murder for allegedly mowing down her boyfriend , Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, as she was dropping him off to meet friends in Canton, Mass., on Jan. 29, 2022. The night of O’Keefe’s death, the couple had been out on a bar crawl, with Read allegedly consuming seven drinks in just 90 minutes, according to reports. Prosecutors claim that after Read drunkenly ran over her boyfriend, she drove off and left O’Keefe to die outside as a snowstorm was set to sweep in. Read’s lawyers argued she was framed in a sweeping law enforcement cover-up and that O’Keefe actually died after getting into an altercation with his officer friends. On July 1, 2024, Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial in the case since the jury was not able to reach a unanimous verdict after five days of deliberations. On April 22, 2025, Read will stand trial for the second time , facing the same charges despite her lawyers’ failed plea attempt to the top Mass. court to drop the murder and hit-and-run charges. Read faced up to life in prison if she had been convicted on the top count of murder. Read explained that she was in the throes of a “personal crisis” and that she needed to lean on O’Keefe for emotional support. Another time she texts about how O’Keefe’s adopted children are “slowly killing our relationship.” “I know your heart isn’t in this anymore. I’ve felt it for awhile and esp lately,” Read texts. 6 A man holds a sign outside Norfolk County Superior Court on April 24, 2025. David McGlynn After some back-and-forth about meeting up, O’Keefe, apparently growing frustrated at the indecision, writes: “I already told you what you should do. Not going to keep doing this.” The couple, however, met up hours later at a bar in Canton — with video surveillance showing them embracing, hours before O’Keefe was found dead in the snow.

The acrimonious exchange was recited in a matter-of-fact monotone by a Massachusetts state trooper during an action-packed day, the third in a sensational murder trial playing out in a Massachusetts criminal court. The texts, between 2:30 p.m. and 8:35 p.m. Jan. 28 2022, were introduced in the last trial — which ended in a mistrial — but this is the first time a jury heard them play out in one continuous exchange. 6 6 6 David McGlynn 6 6 6 AP Previous 1 14 Next Advertisement FOX FOX Advertisement FOX FOX FOX Advertisement FOX FOX FOX Advertisement FOX FOX Advertisement Explore More Explosive texts unveiled at Read trial | Reporter Replay Karen Read witness admits on stand that a key part of her testimony to grand jury wasn’t true Karen Read faces 2nd murder trial | Reporter Replay The beleaguered couple argued over a wide range of touchy issues familiar to anyone in a strained relationship, everything from child care and Facebook statuses to hot water heaters and desperate questions about their future as lovers. “You’ve really hurt me this time,” read one of Read’s texts to O’Keefe flashed on the courtroom screen. Read and the jury watched the screen as State Trooper Nicholas Guarino re-enacted the text fight from the stand. 6 6 6 Courtesy of David Yannetti 6 6 6 AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool “I’m sorry,” O’Keefe writes back, according to Boston 25 News. “This has been an issue w me for 8 years. It physically hurts me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I’m forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy.” Read wonders about their future, and accuses O’Keefe of having a wandering eye and having interest in another woman. “Tell me if you are interested in someone else. Can’t think of any other reason you’ve been like this,” she writes to her beau. He responds, “Nope” and then “Things haven’t been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that? Kids are here. Not in the mood to talk.” Want to learn more about Karen Read’s murder trial?

O’Keefe responds that he is sick of fighting “weekly for several months now.” “So yeh I’m not as quick to jump into being lovie dovie as you apparently,” he adds. He then texts Read, “Omg!! Stop calling.” 6 6 6 AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool Read’s blank, expressionless face was lit by the glow from the screen as Guarino continued to recite the tense exchange. The rapt jurors followed along as well. After a few phone calls between the two, one of which O’Keefe declines to answer, the text fight continues. “I’m going to grab a drink in a bit. Can you pls answer??” Read sends. O’Keefe writes back, “No Karen. Not sure why you need to announce that you’re grabbing a drink but have fun.” What to know about the Karen Read murder case Karen Read, 44, was charged with second-degree murder for allegedly mowing down her boyfriend , Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, as she was dropping him off to meet friends in Canton, Mass., on Jan. 29, 2022. The night of O’Keefe’s death, the couple had been out on a bar crawl, with Read allegedly consuming seven drinks in just 90 minutes, according to reports. Prosecutors claim that after Read drunkenly ran over her boyfriend, she drove off and left O’Keefe to die outside as a snowstorm was set to sweep in. Read’s lawyers argued she was framed in a sweeping law enforcement cover-up and that O’Keefe actually died after getting into an altercation with his officer friends. On July 1, 2024, Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial in the case since the jury was not able to reach a unanimous verdict after five days of deliberations. On April 22, 2025, Read will stand trial for the second time , facing the same charges despite her lawyers’ failed plea attempt to the top Mass. court to drop the murder and hit-and-run charges. Read faced up to life in prison if she had been convicted on the top count of murder. Read explained that she was in the throes of a “personal crisis” and that she needed to lean on O’Keefe for emotional support. Another time she texts about how O’Keefe’s adopted children are “slowly killing our relationship.” “I know your heart isn’t in this anymore. I’ve felt it for awhile and esp lately,” Read texts. 6 6 6 David McGlynn After some back-and-forth about meeting up, O’Keefe, apparently growing frustrated at the indecision, writes: “I already told you what you should do. Not going to keep doing this.” The couple, however, met up hours later at a bar in Canton — with video surveillance showing them embracing, hours before O’Keefe was found dead in the snow. They hit another bar afterward. Read allegedly downed seven drinks in just 90 minutes, according to reports. Read is accused of drunkenly backing into O’Keefe with her SUV in January 2022 after she dropped him off at a house party. Her lawyers have insisted that he was fatally attacked by a cop at that party — and that she’s being framed as part of a conspiracy. She faces up to life in prison.

Attorney's Office drops sexual assault case after attorney lies to judge By WCCO  Staff January 11, 2023 / 9:52 AM CST / CBS Minnesota WCCO digital headlines: Morning of Jan. 11, 2023 WCCO digital headlines: Morning of Jan. 11, 2023 01:16 MINNEAPOLIS -- The Hennepin County Attorney's Office says a criminal sexual conduct case has been dropped due to attorney misconduct. County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced the dropped case on Monday. Moriarty says the prosecutor admitted to lying to the judge last Friday, which was four days into the trial. From the attorney's office: During a recess, while the 17-year-old alleged victim testified with their parent in the courtroom, a victim advocate from our office passed a note to the prosecutor. The note was a reminder to the prosecutor to establish the venue of the offense.  This simply means that it happened in Hennepin County. After seeing the note passed and being concerned it could be a violation of the sequestration order, Judge Cahill called the prosecutor to the bench and questioned the prosecutor about the content of the note. While the note was not a violation of the sequestration order and was not inappropriate in any way, the prosecutor lied to Judge Cahill about its content. Due to the complex evidence and facts, the attorney's office said it was "impossible" to substitute a new attorney, and dropped the case. "We determined that the office would be unable to proceed with prosecution, that we were no longer able to secure a conviction, and that we would be forced to dismiss the charges," a release from the attorney's office said. The attorney was removed from the case and there's now a pending investigation. Moriarty says she's "deeply remorseful and apologetic" to the victim in the case.

Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman — who once appeared to be aligned with Bruderman’s claims that the hospital was robbed of more than $1 billion by state and prior county leaders since 2006 — pulled the plug on his three-year tenure late Thursday. 4 Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman met with FBI Director Kash Patel at the Islanders game at UBS Arena in Elmont Sunday, April 6, 2025. That week, the federal probe was opened. Obtained by the NY Post The county exec, who helped launch the federal investigation by meeting with FBI Director Kash Patel on Long Island in early April, declined to say what caused Bruderman’s firing, only offering him well wishes in his future endeavors. “We thank Matt Bruderman for his service as Chairman of the Board of Nassau University Medical Center. Under his leadership, NUMC was able to reduce its deficits by significant margins and improve its ratings,” Blakeman told The Post.

The binder was later recovered by Center Island police, who confirmed an active investigation is underway, but refused to release further information or say whether anyone was arrested. Despite it all, Bruderman said he was proud of the work he accomplished while at the helm of the hospital and said he remains committed to its mission. 4 Matthew Bruderman, the chairman of NUMC, confirmed his house was broken into and “sensitive” documents were stolen pertaining to a federal investigation into his claims of fraud by previous hospital leaders.

US News Why University of Idaho murders survivor waited hours to call cops after finding roommate dead By Priscilla DeGregory Published April 25, 2025 Updated April 25, 2025, 12:44 p.m. ET One of the surviving roommates of the four University of Idaho students allegedly killed by Bryan Kohberger didn’t immediately call police because she thought her friend was passed out drunk – not realizing she was likely already dead, a new court ruling reveals. After a night out partying, Dylan Mortensen “heard strange noises and crying” before opening her bedroom door and seeing “a man dressed in black with a ski mask on walking by her bedroom door,” around 4:00 a.m., according to a new decision by Boise District Court Judge Steven Hippler. Mortensen then got on the phone with the other surviving roommate, Bethany Funke, and texted furiously. “I’m freaking out rn,” she wrote, adding “I’m not kidding o [sic] am so freaked out.” 7 Dylan Mortensen (left), one of the surviving roommates of the four University of Idaho students allegedly killed by Bryan Kohberger, didn’t immediately call police because she thought her friend was passed out drunk “So am I,” Funke texted her back before encouraging Mortensen to come to her room. The roommate “began running toward” Funke’s room, and “on her way, she noticed Xana [Kernodle] lying on the floor of her bedroom,” but Mortensen “thought Xana was drunk,” the judge’s order explains, citing the surviving roommates’ communications.

But the duo sent many messages and attempted to call the other roommates before eventually emerging from Funke’s room and trying to piece together what had happened. 7 After hearing strange noises and seeing a man dressed in black, Mortensen (left) then got on the phone with the other surviving roommate, Bethany Funke (center), and texted: “I’m freaking out rn,” adding, “I’m not kidding o [sic] am so freaked out.” Maddie Mogen/Instagram Mortensen texted Goncalves at 4:32 a.m., “Pls answer,” and texted Mogen at 10:23 a.m. “R u up?” and then around 11:20 a.m. she texted Goncalves again saying, “R u up??” Mortensen’s friend and the friend’s boyfriend came over at her request to check the 1122 King Road house because she was scared, Hippler’s decision says. Mortensen, Funke, and the two other friends all went up to the second floor of the house, where Kernodle was still lying on the floor. 7 Newly unsealed court evidence shows text messages between the two surviving roommates from the night of the November 2022 attack.

Something’s happened in our house and we don’t know what,” the court papers reveal. 7 Kohberger is accused of fatally stabbing Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, and Ethan Chapin, 20. 7 The alleged murderer has pleaded not guilty in the quadruple homicide case and could face the death penalty if convicted. via REUTERS The operator spoke to Funke, Mortensen, the pal’s boyfriend, and another woman during the chaotic call.

James Keivom The contents of text messages and a 911 call, which lay out Mortensen and Funke’s actions following the killings, were revealed in Hippler’s order about what evidence could be presented to the jury at the upcoming August trial and what evidence would be blocked as hearsay. Hippler found that much of the communications would be allowed into trial as long as prosecutors do their part to properly set the evidence up to be presented in witness testimony. The judge ruled last week that Mortensen is allowed to testify about seeing an intruder with “bushy eyebrows” and a black ski mask walk past her room. 7 The judge ruled last week that Mortensen (left) is allowed to testify about seeing an intruder with “bushy eyebrows” and a black ski mask walk past her room.

When discussing the polarizing prospect on Thursday night during ESPN’s 2025 NFL Draft coverage, Orlovsky called attention to critical sacks Sanders took during games, expressing how plays such as those could contribute to a first-round slide . “If Shedeur doesn’t go early tonight — plays like these, I believe, will be a reason why and what he will have to work on in,” Orlovsky posted to X , which garnered the attention of both a fan and the elder Sanders. 4 Dan Orlovsky’s recent take on Shedeur Sanders stirred buzz on social media.

Judge Hannah Dugan, who has been on the Milwaukee County bench for nearly a decade, is accused of obstruction of justice and concealing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz from arrest following a pre-trial hearing last week. Dugan appeared briefly in Milwaukee federal court Friday morning before being released after prosecutors said they would not ask for her detention before trial. Her arraignment has been set for May 15. She faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted on both counts. It was not immediately clear whether Dugan would be placed on leave during her case. 6 Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for allegedly helping an illegal immigrant evade ICE.

Milwaukee PD Explore More Why University of Idaho murders survivor waited hours to call cops after finding roommate dead Lyin' ex-Rep. George Santos sobs as he learns his fate at sentencing in corruption case LI hospital chair fired hours after revealing thieves stole FBI probe docs from his home in growing scandal: 'Hochul wanted my head' 6 FBI Director Kash Patel announced the judge’s arrest in an X post but soon took it down for unknown reasons. Getty Images “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,” her attorney, Craig Mastantuono, said during the proceeding. According to a criminal complaint obtained by The Post, an ICE officer and a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official showed up outside Dugan’s courtroom April 18 with a warrant for Flores-Ruiz’s arrest for illegally entering the US, but were told by a security guard and a sheriff’s sergeant to wait outside until after the hearing. The complaint noted that Flores-Ruiz, 30, had been deported from the US once before in 2013. It was not immediately clear when he crossed the border again, and there is no evidence he did so legally. Flores-Ruiz was appearing before Dugan April 18 for a pre-trial conference on three misdemeanor battery charges stemming from a fight the previous month in which he was accused of punching another person 30 times after being accused of playing music too loudly, according to a police report obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . The complaint states that while the team assigned to arrest Flores-Ruiz, which included FBI and DEA agents, waited for the hearing to conclude, they were photographed by a public defender, who informed Dugan’s clerk that “there appeared to be ICE agents in the hallway.” After speaking with the clerk, Dugan “became visibly angry” and left the bench to confront the federal agents, according to an affidavit by a FBI special agent. 6 Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested, the director of the FBI announced. Facebook / Hannah Dugan for Judge “Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,” the statement read. After initially demanding that the officers leave the building if they were not there for a court appearance, Dugan allegedly directed the federal agents away from her courtroom to Chief Judge Carl Ashley’s office after being shown the immigration warrant for Flores-Ruiz. After Dugan had gone back inside, the complaint states, a deputy assigned to her courtroom told a member of the federal team that he had not alerted Dugan to their presence and added that the judge was “‘pushing’ Flores-Ruiz’s case through.” View this document on Scribd After Flores-Ruiz’s appearance was completed with him watching from the jury box, the affidavit states, the deputy heard Dugan “say something like, ‘Wait, come with me'” before escorting Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of the courtroom’s “jury door” to a non-public area of the courthouse, where the chief judge had advised the feds that they could not arrest Flores-Ruiz. “These events were also unusual for two reasons,” the complaint states. “First, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge Dugan direct people not to sit in the jury box because it was exclusively for the jury’s use. Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.” Later, a prosecuting attorney asked about the status of Flores-Ruiz’s battery case and was told it had been quietly “adjourned.” “This happened without [the prosecutor’s] knowledge or participation, even though [they were] present in court to handle Flores-Ruiz’s case on behalf of the state, and even though victims were present in the courtroom,” the complaint read. Flores-Ruiz and his attorney made it out of the courthouse before the suspect was arrested by a FBI and DEA agent following a brief foot chase. “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in an X post Friday morning. 6 Kash Patel’s tweet on Hannah Dugan’s arrest. “Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he’s been in custody since, but the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.” Patel later deleted the X post announcing Dugan’s arrest, for reasons that were not immediately clear. Attorney General Pam Bondi later reconfirmed Dugan’s arrest on social media, declaring: “No one is above the law.” Flores Ruiz had been arrested after police were called to a Milwaukee home for a reported fight March 12. In addition to repeatedly punching a person, the police report says he struck a woman who tried to break up the altercation. 6 Judge Hannah Dugan, has been on the Milwaukee County bench for nearly a decade. Facebook / Hannah Dugan for Judge One of the reported victims initially told police that Flores Ruiz was “just a friend that was staying the night.” However, when investigators returned to the home the following day, the victims said he had actually been living there for the past year. Flores Ruiz is now being held in ICE custody at the Dodge Detention Facility in Juneau, about 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee, records show. Dugan’s arrest comes amid a growing feud between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary over the president’s tough immigration stance . In an interview with the Milwaukee Independent in 2016, Dugan had stressed the need for the judiciary system to be free from political pressure. “ The judges in Milwaukee County – the 47 branches of the circuit court and the 19 municipal courts – in my experience act as independent public officials, deciding cases according to the legal process. Sometimes those cases get politicized because of the subject matter,” she said at the time. “It is the role of the judge to be particularly cautious that such cases are handled according to the legal process and not be overwhelmed by political pressure.” While Milwaukee hasn’t officially designated itself a “sanctuary city,” Democratic Mayor Cavalier Johnson has indicated the city would welcome migrants with open arms, telling WUWM earlier this year that he didn’t want to make such a declaration amid fears the city would be targeted by Trump. On Friday, Johnson accused the feds of “showboating” in Dugan’s arrest. “They’re just trying to have this show of force and in the process of doing this, in a courthouse where people need to go for court proceedings, they’re scaring people away from participating in the process,” he told reporters. “If a judge is being arrested in a courthouse, just imagine the chilling effect that it sends to other folks who would otherwise participate in judicial proceedings.” Johnson later released a statement saying that “I am awaiting more detail on the facts of the case, so I am not commenting on what the Judge did — or didn’t do. I will say, I wish the Trump administration would focus less on settling scores with their perceived political enemies and focus their attention on fixing the economy that they’ve broken or remedying the mistakes they have made as they’ve slashed through important federal programs.” Dugan’s arrest comes one day after a recently retired New Mexico judge and his wife were hauled away in cuffs for allegedly sheltering a suspected Tren de Aragua gangbanger at their home. Ex-Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Jose “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were accused of harboring Cristhian Ortega-Lopez in their guesthouse after initially hiring him as a handyman. Dugan graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1986 and was elected in 2016 to the county court Branch 31. She also has served in the court’s probate and civil divisions, according to her judicial candidate biography. Before being elected to public office, Dugan practiced at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid Society.

Judge Hannah Dugan, who has been on the Milwaukee County bench for nearly a decade, is accused of obstruction of justice and concealing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz from arrest following a pre-trial hearing last week. Dugan appeared briefly in Milwaukee federal court Friday morning before being released after prosecutors said they would not ask for her detention before trial. Her arraignment has been set for May 15. She faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted on both counts. It was not immediately clear whether Dugan would be placed on leave during her case. 6 6 6 Mike De Sisti / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images 6 6 6 Milwaukee PD Explore More Why University of Idaho murders survivor waited hours to call cops after finding roommate dead Lyin' ex-Rep. George Santos sobs as he learns his fate at sentencing in corruption case LI hospital chair fired hours after revealing thieves stole FBI probe docs from his home in growing scandal: 'Hochul wanted my head' 6 6 6 Getty Images “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,” her attorney, Craig Mastantuono, said during the proceeding. According to a criminal complaint obtained by The Post, an ICE officer and a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official showed up outside Dugan’s courtroom April 18 with a warrant for Flores-Ruiz’s arrest for illegally entering the US, but were told by a security guard and a sheriff’s sergeant to wait outside until after the hearing. The complaint noted that Flores-Ruiz, 30, had been deported from the US once before in 2013. It was not immediately clear when he crossed the border again, and there is no evidence he did so legally. Flores-Ruiz was appearing before Dugan April 18 for a pre-trial conference on three misdemeanor battery charges stemming from a fight the previous month in which he was accused of punching another person 30 times after being accused of playing music too loudly, according to a police report obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . The complaint states that while the team assigned to arrest Flores-Ruiz, which included FBI and DEA agents, waited for the hearing to conclude, they were photographed by a public defender, who informed Dugan’s clerk that “there appeared to be ICE agents in the hallway.” After speaking with the clerk, Dugan “became visibly angry” and left the bench to confront the federal agents, according to an affidavit by a FBI special agent. 6 6 6 Facebook / Hannah Dugan for Judge “Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,” the statement read. After initially demanding that the officers leave the building if they were not there for a court appearance, Dugan allegedly directed the federal agents away from her courtroom to Chief Judge Carl Ashley’s office after being shown the immigration warrant for Flores-Ruiz. After Dugan had gone back inside, the complaint states, a deputy assigned to her courtroom told a member of the federal team that he had not alerted Dugan to their presence and added that the judge was “‘pushing’ Flores-Ruiz’s case through.” After Flores-Ruiz’s appearance was completed with him watching from the jury box, the affidavit states, the deputy heard Dugan “say something like, ‘Wait, come with me'” before escorting Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of the courtroom’s “jury door” to a non-public area of the courthouse, where the chief judge had advised the feds that they could not arrest Flores-Ruiz. “These events were also unusual for two reasons,” the complaint states. “First, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge Dugan direct people not to sit in the jury box because it was exclusively for the jury’s use. Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.” Later, a prosecuting attorney asked about the status of Flores-Ruiz’s battery case and was told it had been quietly “adjourned.” “This happened without [the prosecutor’s] knowledge or participation, even though [they were] present in court to handle Flores-Ruiz’s case on behalf of the state, and even though victims were present in the courtroom,” the complaint read.

The suspect is accused by Minneapolis Police of causing tens of thousands of dollars to the vehicles. Officers tracked him down using video recorded by the Teslas. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's office said in a statement that her priority is to secure restitution for the victims. “As a result, we will file for pre-charge diversion to best facilitate both of those goals. This is an approach taken in many property crime cases and helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses," a statement from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office said. "Criminal prosecution remains a possibility should unlawful behavior continue.” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara called the decision not to charge the man frustrating for his investigators. “The Minneapolis Police Department did its job. It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified, and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney Office for consideration of charges. This case impacted at least six different victims and totaled over $20,000 in damages. Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office. Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined. In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same," O'Hara said in a statement. The news triggered a flood of posts on social media, most taking issue with the decision not to charge and tying the suspect - who is an employee of the state of Minnesota - to Governor Tim Walz and his alleged soft stance on crime. One poster noted that the vandalism took place weeks after Walz publicly mocked the decline of Tesla stock during a public appearance. Anoka County Attorney Brad Johnson posted: "Just so that no one gets any silly ideas in the north metro from this story, offenders who commit a crime spree causing tens of thousands in damages to multiple victims, will not be approved for pre-charge diversion in Anoka County, " Johnson added, "It makes it worse that the offender is a state employee in a position of public trust.  He would likely become a felon in Anoka County." There has been a nationwide surge in vandalism incidents involving Tesla's since company CEO Elon Musk was recruited by President Donald Trump to steer his new Department of Government Efficiency and began making deep cuts in federal government offices, programs and staffing. Trump posted on his social media channels that anyone who vandalizes a Tesla should be sentenced to 20 years in prison, and suggested that those sentences could perhaps be sent to El Salvador to serve their time.

The Hennepin County Attorney's Office said the man, who works for the Minnesota Department of Human Services, still needs to pay up for his actions. The Minneapolis Police Department and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office have been at odds on many issues and this is another one to add to the list, with the police chief saying he is frustrated. Last week, Minneapolis police arrested a man caught on surveillance video in downtown Minneapolis vandalizing at least six Teslas, causing about $20,000 in damage. Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the damage caused in each case was equivalent to a felony. He said at the time of the arrest this case was a no-brainer. "Frankly, this is pretty stupid. There's high-quality video in all of these cars. It's committing a crime with a spotlight on you," O'Hara said. A spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says it is seeking diversion instead of criminal charges. "This is an approach taken in many property crime cases and helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses," the attorney's office said in a statement. O'Hara responded with his own statement. "Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined," he said. "In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same." David McCormick, a defense attorney not associated with the case, says this feels like a reasonable outcome to him. "It is a win-win if he does what he's supposed to do," McCormick said. "Probation would be the same thing, but [it would] stick him with the stigma of having this criminal conviction. That's the whole point of diversion, to make you not be a problem in the future." The county says offering diversion isn't unusual for property damage cases with no criminal history. Records show since the start of 2023, hundreds of property damage cases have been diverted without charges, about one in five. It's not clear how many of those were felony-level. If the man doesn't comply with the diversion program, including not paying restitution, he'll be criminally charged.

A spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says it is seeking diversion instead of criminal charges. "This is an approach taken in many property crime cases and helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses," the attorney's office said in a statement. O'Hara responded with his own statement. "Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined," he said. "In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same." David McCormick, a defense attorney not associated with the case, says this feels like a reasonable outcome to him. "It is a win-win if he does what he's supposed to do," McCormick said. "Probation would be the same thing, but [it would] stick him with the stigma of having this criminal conviction. That's the whole point of diversion, to make you not be a problem in the future." The county says offering diversion isn't unusual for property damage cases with no criminal history. Records show since the start of 2023, hundreds of property damage cases have been diverted without charges, about one in five. It's not clear how many of those were felony-level. If the man doesn't comply with the diversion program, including not paying restitution, he'll be criminally charged.

US News Video shows moment feds arrest ex-Judge Joel Cano and wife for allegedly sheltering illegal Tren de Aragua gang member By Emily Crane Published April 25, 2025, 8:22 a.m. ET New video captured the moment a recently retired New Mexico judge and his wife were hauled away in cuffs by the feds for allegedly sheltering a suspected Tren de Aragua gangbanger at their home. The footage, shot by KFOX14 News , showed ex-Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Jose “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, being taken into custody following the federal raid at their Las Cruces home on Thursday. At one point, the seemingly calm Democratic judge could be seen with his hands clasped behind his back as he spoke to a heavily armed FBI agent on the sidewalk. 3 Former Dona Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano is arrested.

The raid came soon after it was revealed that Cano had quietly tendered his resignation last month after the couple were accused of harboring Cristhian Ortega-Lopez — an accused illegal migrant who the feds say is a member of the violent Venezuelan gang. Immigration authorities had nabbed the 23-year-old alleged gang member at the couple’s home on Feb. 28. In a separate raid at the home of the couple’s daughter, ICE recovered four firearms — some of which allegedly belong to Ortega-Lopez, investigators said. Cano, who had served as a judge since 2011, made no mention of the migrant’s arrest in his resignation letter. Ortega-Lopez had allegedly been living in the couple’s guesthouse after he was initially hired by Nancy to work as a handyman, according to court documents. 3 A Christmas photo from 2024 of Cristhian Ortega-Lopez in the Cano family home, court documents state.

Wilson urges people to call, threaten lawmakers over uptick in illegal immigration detentions Spring break crime plummeted in Florida hot spot after warning goes viral A group of courageous good Samaritans are being hailed as heroes after stepping in to save a woman and two small children from what could have been a devastating situation outside a Jacksonville, Florida, Department of Motor Vehicles office. The incident took place March 12 in the parking lot of the DMV on North Main Street. According to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, witnesses saw a man attempting to drive away in an SUV while a woman desperately tried to remove her two young children, just 2 years old and 6 months old, from the back seat. Investigators say the man, later identified as 26-year-old Yanni Human, was driving off “against the woman’s will, dragging her and one of the children through the parking lot.” What happened next was nothing short of remarkable. “More than a dozen Jacksonville Good Samaritans stepped in during a dangerous situation, potentially saving a mother and two children from serious injury or worse,” the sheriff’s office wrote in a Facebook post describing the incident. 5 Bystanders look on as a man attempts to steal an SUV with small children inside on March 12, 2025.

But some are wondering if his knack for idiotic, foot-in-mouth comments is also a violation of Minnesota state law, On The Money has learned. At issue: Whether the former loose cannon Dem VP candidate and current Minnesota governor really stepped in it when he began attacking Elon Musk and Musk’s EV company Tesla . Walz reveled in the fact that shares of the EV maker have been declining amid the controversy over DOGE, Tesla-related vandalism and investor concern Musk is spending too much time in Trump’s White House. But the Minnesota pension fund owns shares of Tesla, and maybe more perilous for Walz, he’s an officer of the state pension system, a so-called “fiduciary.” 3 The Minnesota pension fund owns shares of Tesla, and maybe more perilous for Tim Walz, he’s an officer of the state pension system, a so-called “fiduciary.” Jack Forbes / NY Post Design Walz, of course, is known for his goofy antics, and in keeping with form, he headlined a weird rally last week in Wisconsin presumably to energize the Democratic Party base. But instead of attacking Donald Trump, Walz awkwardly pranced around the stage, hollering epithets at Musk. Yes, Musk is the bane of the loony left these days for being a progressive apostate, culling stuff like taxpayer funded transgender dance festivals in Bangladesh from the federal budget. For those mortal sins, not only did Walz call Musk a “dips-it” (and some other choice words), but he also took some inappropriate shots at his EV company.

On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day — $225 and dropping,” Walz bellowed. “And if you own one, we’re not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off,” he added, gesturing something weird with his hands. Very inappropriate since Musk and Tesla do employ American workers, and his pensioners own the stock. The Minnesota state’s pension fund owns, according to its last report, 1.6 million shares of the EV company in its retirement portfolio and a little more than 200,000 shares in another investment vehicle. The pension fund says its records are dated as of December 2024, though it’s a good chance the stock is still being held given Tesla’s presence within the S&P 500. 3 Minnesota state’s pension fund owns1.6 million shares of the EV company in its retirement portfolio and a little more than 220,000 shares in another investment vehicle.  Protesters in St. Paul, Minn., earlier this month. ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA But here’s where those remarks could be legally dicey. Walz as governor is chairman of the pension system, which according to its website has the “primary responsibility…to monitor and evaluate the investment programs as a fiduciary with the goal of making sound investment decisions.” The word fiduciary is key, corporate lawyers and investors told On The Money. A “fiduciary” is a guardian of the pension money for state workers. Attempting to drive down the share price of a holding is a definite no-no, a big one at that. If the pension fund does indeed still own Tesla stock, and if Walz’s name were say Trump, that might lead to an investigation by any number of ambitious, albeit politically motivated opposition state and local prosecutors for an alleged “breach” of his fiduciary duties. 3 If Walz’s name were say Trump, that might lead to an investigation by any number of ambitious albeit politically motivated opposition state and local prosecutors for an alleged “breach” of his fiduciary duties. Holden Smith/ZUMA Press / SplashNews.com Neither Walz nor the pension fund returned calls for comment. Investopedia defines the situation as follows: “Case law indicates that breaches of fiduciary duty most often occur when a binding fiduciary relationship is in effect and actions are taken which violate or are counterproductive to the interests of a specific beneficiary. The inappropriate actions are typically alleged to have benefitted the fiduciary’s interests or the interests of a third party rather than a principal’s or beneficiary’s interests.” Charlie Gasparino has his finger on the pulse of where business, politics and finance meet Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Penn State star pass rusher and noted Eagles fan Abdul Carter said he has the best feeling about the Giants entering Thursday’s 2025 NFL Draft. The Giants are widely projected to pick Carter at No. 3 overall, including in The Post Steve Serby’s final mock draft . “Definitely New York right now, but we’ll see what happens (Thursday),” Carter said Wednesday in Green Bay of which team he has the best feeling about. “I think (the meetings) went well. Definitely got a good feeling with them, we’ll see what happens tomorrow.” The top three picks are coming into focus with the draft a little more than 24 hours away. Cam Ward is slated to go to the Titans with the first pick, two-way phenom Travis Hunter seems headed to the Browns at No. 2 and the Giants are projected by many to forego their glaring long-term quarterback need and add to their stout pass rush by drafting Carter.

Penn State star pass rusher and noted Eagles fan Abdul Carter said he has the best feeling about the Giants entering Thursday’s 2025 NFL Draft. The Giants are widely projected to pick Carter at No. 3 overall, including in The Post Steve Serby’s final mock draft . “Definitely New York right now, but we’ll see what happens (Thursday),” Carter said Wednesday in Green Bay of which team he has the best feeling about. “I think (the meetings) went well. Definitely got a good feeling with them, we’ll see what happens tomorrow.” The top three picks are coming into focus with the draft a little more than 24 hours away. Cam Ward is slated to go to the Titans with the first pick, two-way phenom Travis Hunter seems headed to the Browns at No. 2 and the Giants are projected by many to forego their glaring long-term quarterback need and add to their stout pass rush by drafting Carter.

Carter would provide the Giants another potentially fearsome pass rusher to add to Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Kayvon Thibodeaux.

The former Ole Miss quarterback — who gained momentum as a potential first-round pick and a potential option for the Giants in Thursday’s 2025 NFL Draft — said he “always expected” to be in this position. “Quite honestly, this has just been something that I’ve just expected since I was younger,” Dart, 21, told The Post on Tuesday while discussing his partnership with Head & Shoulders . “I never saw my future or anything else playing out any differently than what it has. So, I’m excited to embark on this next journey and this next phase of life. I have a great corner around me, family keeps me super grounded and we’re just super down to earth people.” 7 Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart looks to pass a ball during an offensive passing drill at the school’s NFL football pro day, Friday, March 28, 2025, in Oxford, Miss.

AP Dart emphasized that he was grateful to develop under Mississippi head coach Lane Kiffin for three seasons as a starter from 2022-24 — where he led the Rebels to three bowl games and had the team in  contention for the College Football Playoff in his final season. “Being able to develop in college was huge for me because I felt like I was at the best place that I could have been to help me go to this next step,” he said. 7 Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart and Mississippi head coach Lane Kiffin.

I think for me, I’ve been able to make a special relationship with him, and it’s going to go far beyond just the time that I played for him there,” Dart said. “It’s honestly just really turned into a really good friendship. Even (sometimes) throughout this process, I’ve taken the trip back to Oxford just to hang out and go play pickleball or just be around the facilities and just talk about random stuff with him. “My experience with coach Kiff has kind of been like a rollercoaster, I would say, from the first time that I got there to how I left it with them. But I’ve been super grateful and fortunate to play for him and just grateful for the special connection that we built.” 7 Mississippi head coach Lane Kiffin looks to the scoreboard after a Vanderbilt score during the second quarter of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022, in Nashville, Tenn.

On Wednesday night, Giants general manager Joe Schoen’s son posted a highlight reel of Dart on Instagram and then set his account to private, according to multiple reports . Many fans took it as a potential hint that the Giants could draft Dart, potentially with the No. 3 pick or by trading back into the first round. The Giants held a private workout with Dart before his Ole miss Pro Day. The Giants are in need of a quarterback of the future after signing short-term deals with veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, but it’s a matter of when they’ll address that. They could consider bolstering other positions with their No. 3 pick or take another quarterback, such as Sanders, arguably the most polarizing prospect in the draft. 7 Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart looks to pass a ball during an offensive passing drill at the school’s NFL football pro day, Friday, March 28, 2025, in Oxford, Miss. AP Giants fans are excited about a potential future with Dart and he already has some New York ties due to his Yankees fandom. “I can show you pictures when I was just a little kid,” Dart said of his trips to The Bronx to see his favorite baseball team. “My dog’s name is also Bronx,” he added with a smile. 7 Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders talks to Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 1, 2025. AP The Post spoke with Dart on behalf of Head & Shoulders, which is his go-to for haircare. “I really care about my hair and it’s something that I’ve used for a while now, so I think I’m just fortunate to have the opportunity to work with them,” Dart said. The quarterback was in Green Bay, Wis. when he spoke to the Post earlier this week, heading to the site of the draft “to kind of see if I wanted to make any last-minute decisions.” Dart opted to celebrate with his family at home in Utah instead of being at the draft site. 7 Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart (QB03) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium on March 1, 2025. Kirby Lee-Imagn Images “I’ll be going back home and being able to be with my family is a huge part for me,” he said. “You’re only allowed to get a limited amount of tickets for the green room and I feel like there have been so many people in my corner who have helped me through this process since I’m a little kid. “I didn’t really see it as if it was all about me. I just wanted to celebrate this moment and be with my loved ones and as many of those people that have been in my corner along the way.” Dart added that some of his former Ole Miss teammates and coaches will be there to celebrate with him — but only after he fits a pilates class in his busy schedule. “I got a few teammates that are going to come to town for it, which is gonna be fun to celebrate with them and all my family is coming through and my friends and coaches who I have had the pleasure of playing for,” Dart said. “That day is kinda of filled up. My mom made sure to make us have a pilates class in the morning and then I’m going to go play golf a little bit and enjoy the day.” The 2025 NFL Draft begins Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET, followed by the second and third rounds Friday and the fourth through seventh rounds Saturday.

The former Ole Miss quarterback — who gained momentum as a potential first-round pick and a potential option for the Giants in Thursday’s 2025 NFL Draft — said he “always expected” to be in this position. “Quite honestly, this has just been something that I’ve just expected since I was younger,” Dart, 21, told The Post on Tuesday while discussing his partnership with Head & Shoulders . “I never saw my future or anything else playing out any differently than what it has. So, I’m excited to embark on this next journey and this next phase of life. I have a great corner around me, family keeps me super grounded and we’re just super down to earth people.” 7 7 7 AP That next chapter could be with the Giants, who hold the No. 3 pick in the draft and are in need of a young quarterback.

Some evaluations have him going off the draft board before Colorado product Shedeur Sanders , who was once viewed as a potential top-three pick. 7 7 7 AP Dart emphasized that he was grateful to develop under Mississippi head coach Lane Kiffin for three seasons as a starter from 2022-24 — where he led the Rebels to three bowl games and had the team in  contention for the College Football Playoff in his final season. “Being able to develop in college was huge for me because I felt like I was at the best place that I could have been to help me go to this next step,” he said. 7 7 7 Instagram/Jaxson Dart Dart couldn’t help but smile when he was asked about his relationship with Kiffin, which he described as a “really good friendship.” “It’s unique. I think for me, I’ve been able to make a special relationship with him, and it’s going to go far beyond just the time that I played for him there,” Dart said. “It’s honestly just really turned into a really good friendship. Even (sometimes) throughout this process, I’ve taken the trip back to Oxford just to hang out and go play pickleball or just be around the facilities and just talk about random stuff with him. “My experience with coach Kiff has kind of been like a rollercoaster, I would say, from the first time that I got there to how I left it with them. But I’ve been super grateful and fortunate to play for him and just grateful for the special connection that we built.” 7 7 7 AP A post shared by CBS Sports College Football (@cbssportscfb) Now, Dart is ready for the opportunity to take his talents to the NFL while embracing adversity. “There’s going to be a lot that I got to learn and embrace adversity and whatnot, but I’m really excited to just learn all the little details within the game and and really be the best leader competitor and player that I can be every time I step out on field,” he said. See Also Bet365 bonus code NYPBET: Jaxson Dart 2025 NFL Draft odds, bets As Dart has risen in draft evaluations, he has been linked to the Giants amid rumors and speculation. On Wednesday night, Giants general manager Joe Schoen’s son posted a highlight reel of Dart on Instagram and then set his account to private, according to multiple reports . Many fans took it as a potential hint that the Giants could draft Dart, potentially with the No. 3 pick or by trading back into the first round. The Giants held a private workout with Dart before his Ole miss Pro Day. The Giants are in need of a quarterback of the future after signing short-term deals with veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, but it’s a matter of when they’ll address that. They could consider bolstering other positions with their No. 3 pick or take another quarterback, such as Sanders, arguably the most polarizing prospect in the draft. 7 7 7 AP Giants fans are excited about a potential future with Dart and he already has some New York ties due to his Yankees fandom. “I can show you pictures when I was just a little kid,” Dart said of his trips to The Bronx to see his favorite baseball team. “My dog’s name is also Bronx,” he added with a smile. 7 7 7 AP The Post spoke with Dart on behalf of Head & Shoulders, which is his go-to for haircare. “I really care about my hair and it’s something that I’ve used for a while now, so I think I’m just fortunate to have the opportunity to work with them,” Dart said. The quarterback was in Green Bay, Wis. when he spoke to the Post earlier this week, heading to the site of the draft “to kind of see if I wanted to make any last-minute decisions.” Dart opted to celebrate with his family at home in Utah instead of being at the draft site. 7 7 7 Kirby Lee-Imagn Images “I’ll be going back home and being able to be with my family is a huge part for me,” he said. “You’re only allowed to get a limited amount of tickets for the green room and I feel like there have been so many people in my corner who have helped me through this process since I’m a little kid. “I didn’t really see it as if it was all about me. I just wanted to celebrate this moment and be with my loved ones and as many of those people that have been in my corner along the way.” Dart added that some of his former Ole Miss teammates and coaches will be there to celebrate with him — but only after he fits a pilates class in his busy schedule. “I got a few teammates that are going to come to town for it, which is gonna be fun to celebrate with them and all my family is coming through and my friends and coaches who I have had the pleasure of playing for,” Dart said. “That day is kinda of filled up. My mom made sure to make us have a pilates class in the morning and then I’m going to go play golf a little bit and enjoy the day.” The 2025 NFL Draft begins Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET, followed by the second and third rounds Friday and the fourth through seventh rounds Saturday. The extravaganza will air on ABC, ESPN and NFL Network.

The Pro Football Hall of Famer addressed the elephant in the room during a news conference ahead of the Buffaloes’ spring game this weekend and told reporters that he believed that part of the negative response had to do with the fact that Shedeur is his son. “We talking about Shedeur, we ain’t talking about nobody else,” Deion said, per The Athletic . “The only reason we are having this discussion is because his last name is Sanders. That’s it. It’s been so many things accomplished at this university expeditiously. It’s been unbelievable. And I think we should be appreciative. It’s a new day, we’re doing things a little different.” 4 Deion Sanders defended his son in getting his Colorado number retired. IMAGN IMAGES via Reuters Connect The school announced Monday that Shedeur Sanders and Hunter would have their respective numbers retired on Saturday during a ceremony at Folsom Field during the spring game. The decision drew swift reactions from the football program’s alumni, who have expressed disappointment and concern that Colorado was leapfrogging other players who had also deserved the honor in order to retire Shedeur’s No. 2 and Hunter’s No. 12.

Bill Belichick is apparently no Rodney Dangerfield when it comes to going back to school, with the gruff coach failing, as of a month or two ago, to endear himself to those in the program, according to Tom Curran, a longtime Boston reporter who covered Belichick. Curran’s report comes alongside a recent article from The Athletic highlighting several notable concerns about Belichick’s short tenure. “From rumblings I heard, and this is not recent, and this a month or two ago, they’re not loving the Bill Belichick experience if you’re an everyday employee down there, which is probably what a lot of the people here in 2000 felt when Bill came aboard and said, ‘I don’t know if I like this.’ It’s uncomfortable,” Curran said Thursday on Boston’s “WEEI Afternoons.” 3 Bill Belichick during the “Practice like a pro” event.

The now-former Volunteers quarterback had over $2 million coming his way from Tennessee this season before electing to enter the spring transfer portal in hopes of a bigger deal elsewhere. Iamaleava’s now looking at UCLA as his next destination, but for far less cash — and even that is far from a done deal. 3 Nico Iamaleava is expected to transfer to UCLA but it has not been made official. AP Iamaleava’s transfer to UCLA has not yet been made official after FS1’s Colin Cowherd was the first to report that the Long Beach native was heading home to Southern California to become a Bruin.

AP Iamaleava’s father, Nic Iamaleava, has been reported as a significant factor behind his son’s decisions. If Iamaleava does officially wind up at UCLA, the price tag might not please the family. “Iamaleava wanted at least $4 million from Tennessee,” Low reported. “What UCLA was prepared to offer him wasn’t remotely close to that figure.” With ESPN’s cautious approach to the reports and what seems like a disconnect regarding the quarterback’s value, it seems Cowherd could have jumped the gun with his breaking news. 3 Colin Cowherd was the first to break the news that Nico Iamaleava is expected to transfer to UCLA.

If Iamaleava does officially wind up at UCLA, the price tag might not please the family. “Iamaleava wanted at least $4 million from Tennessee,” Low reported. “What UCLA was prepared to offer him wasn’t remotely close to that figure.” With ESPN’s cautious approach to the reports and what seems like a disconnect regarding the quarterback’s value, it seems Cowherd could have jumped the gun with his breaking news. 3 3 3 The Herd with Colin Cowherd And it wouldn’t be the first time a Iamaleava-to-UCLA commitment fell through, as Nico’s younger brother, Madden, was committed to the Bruins in high school before flipping to Arkansas very late into the recruiting process. Until any official reports are released, it’s safe to say that Iamaleava’s saga is anything but over.

Lacy’s agent, Rocky Arceneaux of Alliance Sports, released a statement Friday morning ripping the NFL for robbing Lacy of the opportunity because of his presumed guilt in the eyes of the league regarding his alleged involvement in a fatal car crash in December . “To the NFL, shame on you for revoking Kyren’s Combine invitation without acknowledgement or consideration of the facts,” Arceneaux said. “I urge you to re-evaluate your processes and provide athletes with the necessary due process before alienating them from their peers and dreams they’ve worked so hard for.

In the case of ex-Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava leaving the Volunteers amid an NIL discrepancy, the former NFL MVP worries the young prospect is suffering due to the latter. Iamaleava sat out Tennessee’s spring practice in hopes of landing an NIL deal that would bump him from roughly $2.4 million to $4 million, per ESPN , leading to a messy divorce.

There are certain things in people’s careers that it just sticks. … With Nico, he will have this stain on his career and it’s sad because, to Dan Orlovsky’s point, he is still a kid that’s being guided by other people, whether it’s his father, whether it’s his agent, if it’s his family members. It doesn’t matter.” 4 Former Tennessee QB Nico Iamaleava. Getty Images The standoff may cost Iamaleava millions if he has to settle for a lower NIL deal, according to ESPN , with UCLA emerging as his next potential home.

It’s just to make your college experience comfortable. This is not forever money,” Newton said. “You have to understand that. Even though you’re talking about millions and millions and millions of money, you’re at 19-years-old, that money ain’t gonna last past 24. You dig what I’m saying. At 35, everybody love to say, ‘I got old money, I got old hundreds.’ Listen, at 35, I probably got money at 30 still saved. But at 22, 23? Money been spent.” Newton knows Iamaleava after spending time with him at his QB Skills Challenge event and praised him for being a “good kid” and having an unbelievable “family.” 4 Cam Newton speaking on the situation on his show. @4thand1show/X He even noted that the time to leave would have been after Tennessee’s College Football Playoff loss to Ohio State in December. Instead, this situation festered around Tennessee’s spring game as the sides reportedly discussed a new deal and the quarterback no-showed. Iamaleava reportedly wanted to be paid around $4 million per season, upping a deal that could have landed him around $10 million if he finished his career with the Volunteers, per ESPN. A friend, however, told Front Office Sports the dispute was not about money . Newton speculated that someone close to the quarterback pointed out how other transferring signal-callers received large paydays this season. “I did not see this coming. But what I do see about kids and college athletes is, they’re getting it from so many places, ‘Bro, if I was you, you heard how much he signed for?'” Newton speculated. “Just imagine, real example. And I can guarantee you what happened. When Carson Beck left Georgia to go to Miami and he realized Carson Beck made $10 million? I’m better than Carson Beck, I know I can slap ’em for $12, but I’m just making $1.7, $2 million, $3. Bad advice can kill you.” 4 Nico Imaleava could be headed to UCLA. Getty Images Newton said that Iamaleava needs to filter advice through the lens of whether or not people around him have been in his situation, since that adds legitimacy. The former Panthers star said his father is the most influential person in his life, but there are certain topics in which his pops can’t offer much. He believes there’s a chance for Iamaleava to ultimately change the narrative surrounding him. 4 Newton chided those giving the QB what he labeled bad advice. @4thand1show/X “Just stay who you are, bro,” Newton said. “Stay the course. It’s unfortunate to have somebody this young, this talented, have this narrative be with him going forward. “Can you come back from this? Absolutely. But you must understand. Learn from this and I hope you will, and just make better decisions. … The main thing is becoming the best football player that you can possibly be.

It doesn’t matter.” 4 4 4 Getty Images The standoff may cost Iamaleava millions if he has to settle for a lower NIL deal, according to ESPN , with UCLA emerging as his next potential home.

It’s just to make your college experience comfortable. This is not forever money,” Newton said. “You have to understand that. Even though you’re talking about millions and millions and millions of money, you’re at 19-years-old, that money ain’t gonna last past 24. You dig what I’m saying. At 35, everybody love to say, ‘I got old money, I got old hundreds.’ Listen, at 35, I probably got money at 30 still saved. But at 22, 23? Money been spent.” Newton knows Iamaleava after spending time with him at his QB Skills Challenge event and praised him for being a “good kid” and having an unbelievable “family.” 4 4 4 @4thand1show/X He even noted that the time to leave would have been after Tennessee’s College Football Playoff loss to Ohio State in December. Instead, this situation festered around Tennessee’s spring game as the sides reportedly discussed a new deal and the quarterback no-showed. Iamaleava reportedly wanted to be paid around $4 million per season, upping a deal that could have landed him around $10 million if he finished his career with the Volunteers, per ESPN. A friend, however, told Front Office Sports the dispute was not about money . Newton speculated that someone close to the quarterback pointed out how other transferring signal-callers received large paydays this season. “I did not see this coming. But what I do see about kids and college athletes is, they’re getting it from so many places, ‘Bro, if I was you, you heard how much he signed for?'” Newton speculated. “Just imagine, real example. And I can guarantee you what happened. When Carson Beck left Georgia to go to Miami and he realized Carson Beck made $10 million? I’m better than Carson Beck, I know I can slap ’em for $12, but I’m just making $1.7, $2 million, $3. Bad advice can kill you.” 4 4 4 Getty Images Newton said that Iamaleava needs to filter advice through the lens of whether or not people around him have been in his situation, since that adds legitimacy. The former Panthers star said his father is the most influential person in his life, but there are certain topics in which his pops can’t offer much. He believes there’s a chance for Iamaleava to ultimately change the narrative surrounding him. 4 4 4 @4thand1show/X “Just stay who you are, bro,” Newton said. “Stay the course. It’s unfortunate to have somebody this young, this talented, have this narrative be with him going forward. “Can you come back from this? Absolutely. But you must understand. Learn from this and I hope you will, and just make better decisions. … The main thing is becoming the best football player that you can possibly be. The money will come.”  Filed under cam newton nico iamaleava sports media tennessee volunteers 4/17/25 Read Next Unlock full access to Post sports columnists and newsletters  Mike Vaccaro Knicks star sure didn't look soft as Game 3 spark — and it rescued his dizzying series Knicks star sure didn't look soft as Game 3 spark — and it rescued his dizzying series Steve Serby Joe Schoen hits bull's-eye by snaring Jaxson Dart in Giant draft-day double Joe Schoen hits bull's-eye by snaring Jaxson Dart in Giant draft-day double Mark Cannizzaro Jets made a safe pick in Round 1 — and it could come with buyer's remorse Jets made a safe pick in Round 1 — and it could come with buyer's remorse  Log in.

New York State Senator Kevin S. Parker Chairman of Committee on Energy and Telecommunications ( D, WF ) 21st
                  Senate District ( D, WF )    About Our District Newsroom Legislation Events Contact Search Search icon Search login Search Search icon Search Senator Parker Introduces Legislative Package to Modernize Utility Processes and Safeguard Ratepayers Jacinta Osborne February 4, 2025 BROOKLYN, NY – Senator Kevin Parker, Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, led the passage of critical legislation to further protect ratepayers across New York State. This landmark legislative package directly responds to New York's affordability crisis and continues the Senate Democratic Majority's work to prioritize consumers' interests while holding utility companies accountable. Senator Parker's leadership has brought the legislation to the Senate floor, highlighting his ongoing commitment to putting New York's working families first. He is now fighting to ensure the package moves swiftly through the Assembly and reaches the Governor's desk. This package represents Senator Parker's comprehensive approach to addressing the failures of utilities and power producers, ensuring fair and affordable access to utilities for all New Yorkers. "The affordability of utilities is not a luxury; it's a basic right that we must protect for every New Yorker," said Senator Kevin Parker. "I am proud to have led the effort to get this legislation to the Senate floor and to continue the fight for our most vulnerable communities. As utility costs rise, this package ensures no New Yorker is left behind and holds utility companies accountable for their failures. We will continue working to get this legislation to the Governor's desk and make a tangible difference in the lives of all New Yorkers." The package of bills includes: · Utility Hikes Economic Impact (S.1847): Sponsored by Senator Leroy Comrie, this bill would require the Public Service Commission (PSC) to evaluate the economic impact of proposed utility rate hikes, ensuring that any potential increases are balanced with the economic realities faced by consumers. · The Consumer Utility Protections During Investigations (CUPDI) Act (S.904): Sponsored by Senator Kristen Gonzalez, this bill protects utility customers from service terminations and late fees while the PSC investigates a utility company's practices. It also requires customers to be notified of any ongoing investigations. · Limiting Estimated Billing (S.2182): Sponsored by Senator Michelle Hinchey, this bill mandates utility companies to perform actual meter readings, preventing consumers from being charged based on estimated bills and ensuring they only pay for what they owe. · Strengthening Utility Storm Response and Compliance (S.1701): Sponsored by Senator Shelley Mayer, this bill would incentivize better regulatory compliance by utility companies in their storm response efforts and increase penalties for utilities that fail to meet compliance standards. · Utilities to Adopt the Common Equity Ratio (S.1896): Sponsored by Senator Shelley Mayer, this bill would require electric, gas, steam, and water corporations to apply standardized return on equity calculations set by the PSC to ensure fairness in rate setting. · Limits Fixed Charges (S.1329): Sponsored by Senator Kevin Parker, this bill directs the Department of Public Service to adjust utility corporations' fixed residential charges to cover only the direct costs related to metering, billing, service connections, and customer service operations. · Establishing Affordable Payment Plans for Eligible Utility Customers (S.1330): Sponsored by Senator Kevin Parker, this bill establishes a statewide program that mandates utility companies offer affordable payment plans for individuals enrolled in social service programs, ensuring that low-income New Yorkers can maintain access to essential utilities. · Establishing Minimum Standards for Payment Plans for Eligible Utility Customers (S.1327): Sponsored by Senator Kevin Parker, this bill requires the PSC to set clear standards and eligibility requirements for affordable payment plans, ensuring consistency across the state. · Home Energy Assistance Re-enrollment (S.1966): Sponsored by Senator Chris Ryan, this bill ensures that low-income households automatically re-enroll in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) if they remain eligible, reducing barriers to continued support. Through this package of legislation, Senator Kevin Parker is pushing for a comprehensive overhaul of utility regulations that will protect consumers, increase transparency, and ensure affordable access to utilities for all New Yorkers. With the Senate's approval, Senator Parker now turns his attention to securing swift passage in the Assembly and ensuring that the Governor signs these crucial pieces of legislation into law.

This landmark legislative package directly responds to New York's affordability crisis and continues the Senate Democratic Majority's work to prioritize consumers' interests while holding utility companies accountable. Senator Parker's leadership has brought the legislation to the Senate floor, highlighting his ongoing commitment to putting New York's working families first. He is now fighting to ensure the package moves swiftly through the Assembly and reaches the Governor's desk. This package represents Senator Parker's comprehensive approach to addressing the failures of utilities and power producers, ensuring fair and affordable access to utilities for all New Yorkers. "The affordability of utilities is not a luxury; it's a basic right that we must protect for every New Yorker," said Senator Kevin Parker. "I am proud to have led the effort to get this legislation to the Senate floor and to continue the fight for our most vulnerable communities. As utility costs rise, this package ensures no New Yorker is left behind and holds utility companies accountable for their failures.
