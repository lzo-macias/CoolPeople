Examples of this information include the name of the Campaign receiving the contribution, a contributor’s address, employer, or occupation, and the amount of the contributor’s contribution.

Contribute Contribute Contribute Contribute Privacy Policy Contribute (“Contribute”) is an online credit and debit card contributions
platform located at contribute.nycvotes.org (“the Website”) that is created and maintained
by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”) as part of its Contribute initiative. Collection of Information by Contribute In order to improve the content and usability of the Website, the CFB automatically
collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the
following: The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service
Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address
assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of a user’s Internet
Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain
name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge,
Internet Explorer, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer. The date and time a user visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to
Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service

Contribute (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to Contribute,
or use it as a homepage or "Portal." The CFB uses this information to identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility
with the technology used by Contribute's visitors, and to generally add and improve services
offered by Contribute. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time the CFB may
conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects. Any information collected, retained,
or disclosed by the CFB is treated in accordance with the City of New York’s Identifying
Information Law, as well as other relevant federal, state, and local laws. The CFB does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, 3 and the CFB does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by Contribute for commercial or
marketing purposes. Information Submitted to Contribute During a session on Contribute, a user may affirmatively submit information to
the CFB by, among other means, electronic mail ("email"), filling in and
submitting an online form, or by electing to personalize Contribute and use
it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored
in a secure environment, and will be used by the CFB
as part of its routine business as an agency of the City of New York,
in furtherance of its mission and
duties and/or obligations to citizens of the City of New York
(i.e., "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes of affirmatively submitted information may include,
but are not limited to, the following: Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from
Contribute. Investigating a problem reported to the CFB via Contribute. 5 Keeping lists of those who are interested in some particular issue or facet of the
CFB’s work or who request to receive information about the CFB's work or voter
information. Sending informational updates about CFB’s work and conducting outreach on topics
such as, but not limited to, voter education and civic engagement. Assisting users in registering to vote, checking their voter registration, correcting
their voter registration, finding their political representatives, finding out about
candidates running for office in their district, and obtaining a copy of their election ballot. Assisting the CFB with its voter education and campaign finance mandates by tracking
the numbers of users of the services and the services used on Contribute. Disclosure of such information required to be disclosed by the CFB under the provisions
of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 Helping the CFB respond to a request for information not readily available from

of the New York City Charter and New York City Campaign Finance Act, or pursuant to a
request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") or court order, if such
information is not protected by federal, state, or local law. 6 The CFB does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such
as name, birth date, address, phone number, email, etc., or other information that
identifies or could lead to the identification of a user as a particular person), nor
would the CFB exchange or trade such information with third parties without a user's
explicit permission. The CFB does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable
information other than as necessary to complete a voter registration inquiry or credit
card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user.
All such use by the CFB of financial information shall be subject to the section of this
policy on financial issues, set forth below. If a Contribute user has elected not to receive further information from the CFB, the CFB
will not send such information. If the CFB sends email to a user, such email is not
confidential, 7 and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news
media. Security and Monitoring In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to
access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password
to anyone, and the CFB will never ask a user for a password in an email, telephone call,
fax, or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an
application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the
relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a
publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if
applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password
might be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The CFB has integrated industry standard or stricter security measures and systems into
the design, implementation, and day to day operation of Contribute and its underlying
servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the CFB maintains ongoing efforts to identify
and/or block unauthorized intrusions into, attempts to upload to or change information
on, or activities that otherwise cause damage to Contribute or the information resident
hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The act of using Contribute constitutes the user’s express consent to the CFB’s
monitoring of all uses of the system.  If such monitoring reveals possible evidence
of criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration personnel
may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials, as authorized or
required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between
visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.
The CFB uses "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of Contribute, and such temporary cookies
expire upon the end of the browsing session. The Website, and Contribute generally, do not
use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use Contribute as a customized
portal, the CFB uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The CFB may
also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and patterns of unique and
repeat visitors and to enhance the accessibility of the site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web
browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by
user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however,
may lead to loss of functionality on those Contribute pages requiring cookies to function
fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of Contribute, the CFB
will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any
custom content modules requested and, if a user elected the "remember me" option for
signing in to Contribute, the cookie will contain a user's password. Deletion of such a
cookie could result in the loss of one's customized Contribute portal settings. Web Bugs (Web Beacons) Contribute does not use web bugs 12 on its web pages or in any html email generated by
use of the portal, or otherwise sent from Contribute, for any purpose other than to
identify site performance needs, to ensure compatibility with the technology used by
Contribute's visitors, and generally to add and improve services offered on Contribute. Children Contribute may not be used by persons under the age of 18. No applications on nycvotes.org
specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a
minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being
from minors, users of Contribute should be aware that personally identifiable information
submitted to Contribute by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as
information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City of New York strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor
in Internet use by minors. Therefore, Contribute asks parents to guide their minor children
when children are asked to provide any personal information online. Contribute further
asks that children ask for and receive parental consent before providing any information
online. Third Party Links Contribute provides links to, and may be linked from, federal, state, or local government
agencies, and from, or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links
neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)
or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility
or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Any link between
Contribute and a third-party website also does not imply sponsorship of such website,
or the creator of such website. Some content on portions of Contribute resides on servers run by third parties and are
bound by Contribute’s privacy policy. 13 Intellectual Property The content of Contribute's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party
images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are therefore notified to
presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or
otherwise using images/graphics from the Website. Contribute may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and reserves the right
to do so without notice. Copyright 2025 The New York City Campaign Finance Board Privacy Policy Footnotes An IP address is a numeric value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer

Jump to topic General Ranked Choice Voting Vote by Mail Early Voting Election Day Registering to Vote Voting Rights Accessibility Contribute - For Contributors Contribute - For Campaigns General Back to Top What is a Primary Election? It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election? General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election? Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot? Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting? In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work? You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate? Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates? No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once? No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice? No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting? To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Does ranking 5 candidates mean I have 5 votes? No. Your vote only counts for the highest active candidate on your ballot. Your vote will only count for your 2nd choice if your 1st choice is eliminated, and so on. Learn how votes are counted with Ranked Choice Voting Will the voting machine tell me if I make a mistake on my ballot? If you vote in person, the voting machine will let you know if you give multiple candidates the same ranking. If you make a mistake, you can ask a poll worker for a new ballot.

Best practice: Have the candidate or treasurer make a small test contribution (which may be matchable) and upload it to C-SMART. How long does it take for contributions to be deposited in my committee bank account? Transfers will occur daily and consist of contributions received two business days prior. Your first transfer may take up to one week to process. You will receive a monthly Stripe account statement from Contribute, which shows the contributions received for the month as well as the month’s total of Stripe processing fees deducted from your contributions.

In C-SMART, you can review the backup documentation for each contribution uploaded by Contribute. For more information on viewing this documentation, in Monetary Contribution Documentation in C-SMART Help . 2.    Merge duplicate name records Uploads from Contribute to C-SMART might create duplicate name records for your contributors in your C-SMART database. This will occur when a name record already exists in C-SMART for someone who donates through Contribute. To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions. The easiest way to do this is to generate the Contributions Over the Limit report in C-SMART, which will list all contributions for a contributor whose total contributions have exceeded the contribution limit for the office sought. 4.    Claim eligible contributions for matching funds Contributions from Contribute are not automatically claimed for match. After each upload, you must enter a matching amount for eligible contributions received through Contribute.

How are Stripe fees uploaded to C-SMART? In addition to contributions, you can upload monthly Stripe processing fees directly to C-SMART from your Contribute account page.

When you log into your Contribute account, you will be automatically directed to the Data section of your account page. To upload Stripe fees, enter your C-SMART encryption key in the Encryption Key field and click Upload.

In C-SMART, you can search for “Stripe – NYC Votes Contribute” to review your newly-uploaded Stripe fees. The amount of fees deducted for the month will be reported as bill and bill payment transactions in C-SMART. How do I create a fundraising event page?

This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials. If you are fundraising for multiple election cycles, note that the list of candidates on contribute.nycvotes.org only includes candidates running in active election cycles. Contribute for post-election fundraising, your name will not appear on this list but the direct link to your contribution page will be accessible from the Tools tab of your committee’s Contribute account.

Can I accept contributions from supporters living outside the United States? Yes, you may accept contributions from U.S. citizens or permanent residents, even if they live outside of the United States. Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?

It’s the election before the election. In primary elections, you decide which candidate will be your party’s nominee for the general election. You must be a member of a political party to vote in a primary. Learn more about types of elections What is a General Election?  General elections are the championship match, where candidates from different parties compete to win elected office. Winners of primary elections represent their party in the general election. General elections sometimes include ballot proposals, where voters choose whether to adopt new laws or policies. Learn more about types of elections What is a Special Election?  Special elections are held when an elected official leaves office before the end of their term. The winner serves in office until the end of that term. Learn more about types of elections Where can I find information about the candidates who will be on the ballot?  Right here! To learn more about the candidates on your ballot, just click on “Meet the Candidates” in the navigation up top. You can enter in your address to find which offices will be on your ballot, and a list of candidates running for each office. You can also find profiles submitted by candidates, including videos and more. Meet the candidates Ranked Choice Voting Back to Top What is Ranked Choice Voting?  In primary and special elections for local offices, you can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting How does Ranked Choice Voting work?  You can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. If a candidate receives more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, they are the winner. If no candidate earns more than 50% of 1st-choice votes, then counting will continue in rounds. At the end of each round, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated. If you ranked that candidate 1st, your vote will go to the next highest ranked candidate on your ballot. This process will continue until there are two candidates left. The candidate with the most votes wins. Learn more about Ranked Choice Voting Can I still vote for just one candidate?  Yes! You can still vote for just your 1st- choice candidate. However, ranking other candidates does not harm your 1st choice. If your 1st and only choice is eliminated, your vote will have no influence on the outcome of the election. (You may hear folks call this an “exhausted ballot.”) Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Do I have to rank a total of 5 candidates?  No. You can rank up to five candidates, but you do not need to rank a total of 5. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank my favorite candidate more than once?  No. If you rank your preferred candidate more than once (for example as your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th choice), then only your first ranking will count. There is no strategic benefit to giving the same candidate multiple rankings. It doesn’t help them, and it takes away your chance to have a say about who you’d choose next out of the remaining candidates (This is another way your ballot can get “exhausted”). Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot Can I rank multiple candidates as my first choice?  No. You can only choose one candidate for each ranking. If you choose more than one candidate as your 1st choice, your ballot will not be valid. Learn how to fill out your Ranked Choice ballot How do I vote for a write-in candidate with Ranked Choice Voting?  To vote for a candidate whose name is not on the ballot, write their name on the “Write-in” line and fill in an oval to rank your write-in choice.

To ensure accurate disclosure and prevent over-the-limit contributions, you must merge any duplicate name records after each upload. For instructions, see Merge Duplicate Names in C-SMART Help . 3.    Check for over-the-limit-contributions Review your contributions for any over-the-limit contributions.

This means that a candidate can fundraise for post-election expenses for one committee, while also fundraising for their next election after registering a new committee. Candidates and treasurers working on more than one campaign can access all committees’ Contribute accounts from a single dashboard using one set of log in credentials.

Only contributions from individual New York City residents are eligible to be matched with public funds. Will Contribute help me with the CFB’s public disclosure requirements?

Diaz for New York City Council Who is Rosa G. Diaz? Who is Rosa G. Diaz?  A Mother. A Community Leader. An Advocate for the Underserved. Hi I'm Rosa Diaz! A proud member of the District 8 community. My mission is to keep supporting and advocating for families and the disadvantaged communities. I'm here to tell you that Rosa cares about YOU! Hi I'm Rosa Diaz! A proud member of the District 8 community. My mission is to keep supporting and advocating for families and the disadvantaged communities. I'm here to tell you that Rosa cares about YOU!   In my early years, while I was still in my country Peru living with my Grandparents, all I did was go to school, help around the house, go to the corral and run errands. Never thought I was going to be able to make a difference with my experience, knowledge and skills. Since I came to the USA, in early 2000, I cannot say that my life was easier at all. Everything has been a challenge, from learning a new language, adjusting my whole life, losing contact with my family, advocating for myself and translating for my mom in the complicated and challenging New York City Public Educational System. But the need for knowledge, my eagerness to keep learning and advocating has brought me to a higher demand in my passion for helping others in need. As people say, knowledge is power.

But the need for knowledge, my eagerness to keep learning and advocating has brought me to a higher demand in my passion for helping others in need. As people say, knowledge is power.   For most of my life, I have been serving, advocating and protecting families’ rights, especially many immigrant families in my neighborhood who do not know their rights in this country, USA. My work began when I started volunteering at East Harlem Community Partnership, a division of the Administration for Children Services. I empathize with all the current services and resources people need, from serving food, food pantry, clothing drive, Christmas events, learning a new language support etc. I saw my work making a difference in people’s lives and soon became my passion. Then, partnering with other non-profits doing the work, I began to welcome new migrants, educate them about the Department of Education's complicated system and how to enroll their child in school and all the wonderful opportunities and resources there are for families. I can truly say that I am proud of supporting and being able to provide safe, and accountable support to those in great need. This is why I started to support non-profit organizations that fully concentrate on helping the immigrant population and their direct needs.
