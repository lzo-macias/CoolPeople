Her name for this potential future piece of legislation? The Withholding Eligibility In NYC Elections for Restricted Individuals Act – the WEINER Act. That’s a reference to the  controversial candidate also running in the Democratic primary for the Council District 2 seat: Anthony Weiner. The former Congress member filed paperwork to run in December, looking to launch a potential comeback over a decade after leaving office amid a sexting scandal. In 2017, Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison for having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl. And as he neared the end of his prison sentence in 2019, a judge ordered him to register as a level-one sex offender. “We have 4.5 million people in New York City who are women and when we see men like this running for office, it really sends the message that our safety is expendable, our pursuit of justice is futile, and our pain is invisible,” said Batchu, a nonprofit leader and the former vice chair of Community Board 3. Related articles New York City Council 2025 primary races to watch If elected to the City Council, she would look to immediately introduce the legislation upon taking office in 2026. While Batchu has so far led the field in fundraising, it’s a competitive race. In addition to her and Weiner, Assembly Member Harvey Epstein and Community Board 3 Chair Andrea Gordillo also have strong campaigns. For now, Batchu is hoping to start a conversation at a time where multiple former elected officials accused of sexual misdeeds – not just Weiner – are seeking political comebacks. Many people believe the victory of President Donald Trump – who was found liable in a civil trial of sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carrol – has emboldened others to try and resuscitate their political careers. Reached for comment, Weiner texted, “No shit that my opponents don’t want me in the race when so many voters are looking for something other than more of the same.” Batchu’s proposed law would not affect politicians like Andrew Cuomo, mayoral candidate Scott Stringer or Mayor Eric Adams, who have all been accused of sexual misconduct. All three men deny wrongdoing. None have been convicted of, or even charged with a crime. The WEINER Act would not even theoretically apply to Hiram Monserrate, a City Council candidate running for a seat in Queens , was booted from the state Senate in 2010 after he was charged with assaulting his then-girlfriend. He was later convicted of misdemeanor reckless assault, not a sex crime. The state does not currently have a sweeping ban on individuals with criminal convictions running for public office, although some convictions – specifically those related to public corruption – can lead a candidate to being disqualified. In 2021, the New York City Council passed a law to prohibit candidates running for office if they’ve been previously convicted of certain corruption charges. Batchu’s proposal would expand those restrictions to include the conviction of sexual offenses. Enforcement would be carried out by a review commission, which would evaluate candidates' backgrounds while working with law enforcement and judicial systems to access conviction records, according to Batchu. Voicing support for Batchu’s proposal, Queens City Council Member Julie Won said she thinks expanding the existing law to also ban sex offenders of varying degrees is the right thing to do. “If you have such a great redemption story, good for you, let's make a movie out of it,” Won said. “But do you really need to be in a position of power where you are going to have a higher platform where you are going to have even more opportunities to do harm in a way you’ve done before?” As for whether the proposal would find wider support in the City Council, Won pointed to the body’s current women-majority. “I don’t know anyone that’s looking forward to (potentially) having sex offenders in the chambers with us for votes,” she said. Correction: Due to an editing error, this story previously mischaracterized the misdemeanor assault conviction of Hiram Monserrate. Monserrate was convicted of assault in the third degree, meaning he recklessly caused injury to another person, after surveillance video showed him dragging his visibly distressed girlfriend through the lobby of his apartment building in 2008. She was treated for a cut on her face that required stitches.

	                Supporters of Survivors From:
	                  [Your Name] As community members committed to the betterment of District 2 and all of New York City, I urge you to sign the petition to uphold the integrity of our public offices and protect the safety and trust of our communities. The candidacy of individuals with histories of sexual misconduct convictions, such as former Rep. Anthony Weiner—who was convicted in 2017 for illicit online communication with a minor and is a registered level-one sex offender—demonstrates the urgent need for legislative reform. Sarah Batchu is a dedicated community leader, New York City Council candidate for District 2, and sexual assault survivor who is pledging to introduce the Withholding Eligibility In NYC Elections for Restricted Individuals Act (WEINER Act) once elected. This proposed legislation would prohibit registered sex offenders and individuals convicted of sexual harassment, abuse, or rape from holding public office in our city. By supporting the WEINER Act, you can take a stand for the well-being of all residents and reinforce the ethical standards essential to effective governance. Please sign this petition today and share it with your networks to show solidarity with sexual assault survivors and safeguard the future of our city. Thank you for your time and commitment to a safer, more just New York City— for all.

What’s the newest in street design? What will make our streets safer? When I first heard the term “daylighting” (essentially eliminating car parking at the corners of intersections so that drivers, pedestrians & bicyclists can see each other better) it made complete sense. I had lived in New York City among the chaos of its streets for 15 years at that point, and I certainly experienced and witnessed on a daily basis near misses by vehicles. So I integrated daylighting into my work whenever possible, and became an early advocate and chronicler of the practice. Today I have at least 20 Streetfilms from over the years where daylighting is the starring or supporting character. The City just announced it plans to daylight 1,000 intersections annually , so this seems like the right time to look back at the history of daylighting in New York. I won’t include all my videos here, but I selected some favorites to give you a sense of the evolution, incarnations, and styles. Scroll to watch some great before and after footage of Third Avenue, peak-pandemic Open Restaurants, and more! The above video with Carl Mahaney from Open Plans’ StreetopiaUWS is an excerpt from my newest Streetfilm on the recent transformation of Third Avenue. But below I have a 2008 film that, although a bit dated, is still a perfect explainer of daylighting and showcases my fondness for it. And I am even in it! Concurrently, I was obsessing during every winter about how after heavy snowfalls you could observe tire tracks in snow demonstrating how vehicles don’t use the full capacity of overbuilt intersections. We coined that visual phenomena of nature’s tracing paper showing where you could extend sidewalks or make daylighting - “sneckdowns” (snow + neckdowns). And there were 100s joining in the fun posting their sneckdown photos from around the globe! I promised the above would be the final entry in a trio of sneckdown Streetfilms, but later that Spring in 2017, the NYC DOT started doing more with implementing some intersections and so I went out on the streets and made some observations. Here’s how during the pandemic, outdoor dining in many ways helped improve intersection visibility by naturally having tables and chairs at corners instead of car parking. Or here is a phenomenal group bike tour of Hoboken & Jersey City during 2022’s Vision Zero Cities Conference where daylighting is plentiful. Note: it has now been six years since the City of Hoboken has had a single traffic death, due in part to their aggressive daylighting program! And finally just two months ago, NYC DOT completed a retro-fit of the Berry Open Street in Williamsburg to make it permanent and introduce new elements to calm traffic and thwart thru traffic. A good portion of this film shows off the daylighting at the intersections which includes effective things to keep corners car-free using things like: bike parking, slabs of rock, planters, Citibike parking and more. I hope you enjoyed my journey. It’s been a long one, but the last few months I’ve had a big smile on my face as communities ask for more daylighting on their streets. My city is starting to change and maybe all this work is finally paying off dividends. If we eventually get to universal daylighting there’s no doubt we will save lives. daylighting livable streets community street design Streetfilms Guest User Streetfilms: video proof of daylighting’s long history making NYC streets more livable Dec 18 Written By Guest User Since 2005 when I started making the videos which would eventually become Streetfilms, I have been on a constant look out for opportunities to enlighten the public to the next cool thing.

The above video with Carl Mahaney from Open Plans’ StreetopiaUWS is an excerpt from my newest Streetfilm on the recent transformation of Third Avenue. But below I have a 2008 film that, although a bit dated, is still a perfect explainer of daylighting and showcases my fondness for it. And I am even in it! Concurrently, I was obsessing during every winter about how after heavy snowfalls you could observe tire tracks in snow demonstrating how vehicles don’t use the full capacity of overbuilt intersections. We coined that visual phenomena of nature’s tracing paper showing where you could extend sidewalks or make daylighting - “sneckdowns” (snow + neckdowns). And there were 100s joining in the fun posting their sneckdown photos from around the globe! I promised the above would be the final entry in a trio of sneckdown Streetfilms, but later that Spring in 2017, the NYC DOT started doing more with implementing some intersections and so I went out on the streets and made some observations. Here’s how during the pandemic, outdoor dining in many ways helped improve intersection visibility by naturally having tables and chairs at corners instead of car parking. Or here is a phenomenal group bike tour of Hoboken & Jersey City during 2022’s Vision Zero Cities Conference where daylighting is plentiful. Note: it has now been six years since the City of Hoboken has had a single traffic death, due in part to their aggressive daylighting program! And finally just two months ago, NYC DOT completed a retro-fit of the Berry Open Street in Williamsburg to make it permanent and introduce new elements to calm traffic and thwart thru traffic. A good portion of this film shows off the daylighting at the intersections which includes effective things to keep corners car-free using things like: bike parking, slabs of rock, planters, Citibike parking and more. I hope you enjoyed my journey. It’s been a long one, but the last few months I’ve had a big smile on my face as communities ask for more daylighting on their streets. My city is starting to change and maybe all this work is finally paying off dividends. If we eventually get to universal daylighting there’s no doubt we will save lives. daylighting livable streets community street design Streetfilms  Guest User Previous Previous You are helping to build a new era You are helping to build a new era Newsletter: Your package is delayed because NYC needs curb reform NAVIGATE NAVIGATE About Our Campaigns Press Room Blog Events Support About  Our Campaigns  Press Room  Blog  Events  Support SISTER ORGANIZATIONS SISTER ORGANIZATIONS Streetfilms Streetsblog NYC StreetsblogUSA Streetfilms  Streetsblog NYC  StreetsblogUSA 377 Broadway, 11th Floor New York, NY 10013 377 Broadway, 11th Floor New York, NY 10013 Get in touch hello@openplans.org Get in touch hello@openplans.org OpenPlans® is a registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation. © 2024 Open Plans | All rights reserved.

Sarah nació en una familia con una dedicación de toda la vida al mejoramiento y bienestar de su comunidad. Hija de dos médicos, fue criada para comprender la importancia y el poderoso impacto de cuidar a los demás. Desde temprana edad, creyó que el servicio no era solo un valor, sino una forma de vida. Como estudiante en Barnard College, el compromiso de Sarah con el servicio se profundizó aún más a medida que respondía al movimiento en torno a la agresión sexual en el campus. Como sobreviviente, Sarah comprendió íntimamente el costo que la falta de seguridad podría
tener en la mente y el cuerpo. Con la guía de otros sobrevivientes y activistas comunitarios de toda la ciudad, transformó su propio dolor en un compromiso continuo para construir una ciudad más segura para todos, y desde entonces ha tenido una carrera orientada a los resultados en el servicio público. Desde los primeros días de su carrera en el gobierno de la ciudad de Nueva York en el Ayuntamiento, Sarah comenzó a abordar los grandes problemas de frente, como abordar el desmoronamiento de la infraestructura de vivienda pública de la ciudad y planificar una respuesta efectiva a la pandemia de COVID-19. En solo unos pocos años, la dedicación y tenacidad de Sarah produjeron resultados notables y comprobados para miles de neoyorquinos:  Sarah recaudó millones para crear programas públicos
innovadores que atienden a los neoyorquinos de todos los
ámbitos de la vida, incluidas las mujeres , los inmigrantes y las personas con discapacidades. . Sarah abogó con éxito por reformas para aumentar el acceso a viviendas seguras y asequibles para los neoyorquinos anteriormente involucrados en la justicia. Sarah diseñó, lanzó y administró Get Help NYC, una innovadora plataforma en línea que se convirtió en el principal centro de recursos de la ciudad durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Sarah trabajó directamente con los residentes de viviendas

Create a Director of the Public Realm Commitments from Elected Officials THE FIVE POINT PLAN FOR PARK EQUITY THE FIVE POINT PLAN FOR PARK EQUITY New York City’s parks and open spaces are critical infrastructure. In the densest city in the United States, our parks and open spaces have always been our backyards. Parks are places for joy but also essential resources for physical, mental, social, and ecological health. They are critical tools in our fight against climate change and they are drivers of economic development. For NYC to recover and thrive, parks and open spaces must be catalysts for equity and environmental justice. We need a new era for parks. #NewEra4Parks    Most major U.S. cities spend between 1-2% of their city budgets on parks. NYC Parks has received about 0.5% of the city budget for parks maintenance and operations, even less than it received during the ‘70s financial crisis. Conditions in NYC parks vary widely, with parks in low income areas often receiving less maintenance and investment. Parks conditions fall short of the City’s own standards. NYC must commit to a higher standard of maintenance across the five boroughs and designate NYC Parks as an essential city service. Committing 1% of the city budget for maintenance and operations would fund a year-round well-trained team of parks professionals rather than relying on seasonal staff that turns over each year, and ensure more robust green job opportunities. Invest in maintenance to ensure parks are safe, clean, and accessible NYC must invest in positions and programs that enhance safety, routine maintenance, and access to better serve surrounding neighborhoods. Urban Park Rangers and Parks Enforcement Patrol officers, now woefully underrepresented in numbers, help park users feel more safe and comfortable. Right now, 47 Urban Park Rangers and fewer than 300 Parks Enforcement Patrol officers monitor over 30,000 acres of parks and open spaces in NYC. More full-time maintenance staff presence helps build community relationships, volunteer participation in parks, and overall better conditions.

For decades, this has worsened chronic issues. NYC Parks needs more resilient and reliable funding to protect our parks, specifically those in underserved communities, from economic downturns. One model implemented in many major U.S. cities is to have dedicated tax streams that fund their parks budgets. Another source of revenue includes funds generated from concessions in NYC parks - currently, those funds go to the NYC general fund. NYC should change this model and keep concessions revenue within the parks system. Resources: NY4P and New York Building Congress “Building the Future of New York: Parks and Open Space” NYC Green Fund "Literature Review"    New Yorkers do not have enough equitable access to parks and open space. Period. Focus on parks and playgrounds in under-resourced communities and neighborhoods that don’t have adequate access to parks The COVID crisis has laid bare what has been known for decades – NYC does not provide equitable access to parks. New Yorkers in large swaths of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx do not have access to a park within a 10-minute walk, a minimum standard measure for cities across the country. Parks in low-income communities are two times smaller than parks in more affluent areas of NYC, and parks in majority Black communities are nearly four times smaller than in majority white communities. Additionally, there are far too many neighborhoods impacted by environmental injustices like major roadways and heavy industries, where residents do not have access to large, safe, and healthy parks. Resources: NY4P Open Space Profiles El Puente "¡Nuestro Aire! / Our Air!" Trust for Public Land "Park Equity Plan for New York City"   Invest in comprehensive access and maintenance of natural areas and waterfronts NYC has 20,000 acres of natural areas, an urban forest of over 7 million trees, and 520 miles of waterfront, 161 miles of which are managed by NYC Parks. These spaces are not equitably accessible or maintained, and many frontline communities are vulnerable to rising sea levels. As climate change continues to threaten our waterfront city, NYC must invest in comprehensive environmental plans that protect natural areas, ecology, and waterfront to make our city more climate resilient. Resources: Natural Areas Conservancy “Forest Management Framework” Waterfront Alliance “Four-Point Plan for the Waterfront” NYC Nature Goals “Goals & Targets 2050” Harbor Estuary Program “Action Agenda” Natural Areas Conservancy "Wetlands Management Framework for NYC" Natural Areas Conservancy "NYC Strategic Trails Plan” The Nature Conservancy in NY “NYC Urban Forest Agenda”    Parks projects in NYC take longer to complete and cost more than they should. And our neighborhoods suffer because of it. We partnered with the Center for an Urban Future to launch Build Back Faster NYC, a campaign on citywide capital reform. Reform the citywide procurement process so we can build faster and cheaper As part of our recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, NYC must reform its capital process to save valuable public dollars, especially during the fiscal crisis. Public capital projects in New York City, including parks projects, take much longer and cost more than they do in other cities. Estimates indicate that nearly $1B could be saved over five years by reforming the city’s capital process. Parks infrastructure is no different. Park bathrooms/comfort stations cost $4 million to build and street trees cost $3,400 per installation. With $6B in deferred maintenance projects, the majority of which are in areas long neglected, these delays and costs are robbing our residents of better parks. Resources: Center for an Urban Future "Stretching New York City's Capital Dollars" NY4P and Public Works Partners “A Survey of Capital Projects Management Among New York City Government Agencies” New York Building Congress “Building The Future of New York”   Give NYC Parks a flexible capital budget Unlike other agencies that do capital construction, NYC Parks does not have a meaningful discretionary budget nor does it have a comprehensive capital needs assessment, making it impossible to plan and budget for capital projects long-term citywide. Further, the agency is reliant on discretionary allocations from City Council Members and Borough Presidents whose priorities may not align with those of the Department. This creates an inequitable, inefficient, and potentially politicized process for funding capital projects. This system compounds the effects of chronic neglect in under-resourced communities, who often have less opportunity and political capital to advocate for vital improvements. Resources: Center for an Urban Future “A New Leaf: Revitalizing New York City’s Aging Park Infrastructure” NY4P and New York Building Congress “Building the Future of New York: Parks and Open Space”        From volunteers and community gardens to “friends of” groups to conservancies, NYC has a deep history of civic engagement and not-for-profit stewardship. Yet the city makes it difficult for these groups to do their work. Champion and indemnify our not-for-profit partners and volunteer groups NYC has a deep history of not-for-profit parks advocates and stewards. Many of these groups gained traction when disinvestment in our communities led to disastrous park conditions and blighted vacant lots. The not-for-profit and volunteer model is now an essential part of the NYC parks system. These stewards range from large conservancies to “friends of” groups to community gardeners to small volunteer networks. The city must embrace and support these groups to allow them to improve the park and garden spaces their communities rely on. By streamlining the process for license agreements and indemnifying these small not-for-profits and volunteer groups, NYC will ensure that these vital partners continue to care for parks and gardens across the five boroughs. Additionally, NYC Parks must continue to prioritize the voices of the communities that are most impacted by park improvements and developments. Resources: City Limits “Nonprofits Say They’ve Felt a Legal Squeeze from the De Blasio Administration”   Facilitate partnerships and programs that enhance access to resources in parks and open spaces Parks and community gardens are the centers of their communities and their stewards address many of NYC’s most pressing social needs. During the COVID crisis, many community gardens helped address food insecurity, volunteer groups collected compost when programs were cut, and “friends of” groups volunteered in record numbers to pick up trash. NYC should promote these activities and make it easier for groups to facilitate programs that serve social and community needs. Resources: NY1 “Volunteer Organizations Clean Parks Across the City Amid Maintenance Budget Cuts” NYC Council “Growing Food Equity in New York City”     NYC needs a cross-agency open space vision that focuses on parks, equitable access, climate resiliency, public health, and equitable economic development. We need a 21st Century Parks System. Prioritize equitable access to parks and open space Access to open space varies widely across boroughs, neighborhoods, and districts. The size and quality of parks follow in step with patterns of historic neglect, disinvestment, and environmental injustice, which disproportionately impact communities of color and those with lower incomes. As NYC continues to recover and develop, equitable access to parks and open spaces must be a singular priority and one integrated into the priorities of other sectors including affordable housing, transportation, and infrastructure. Resources: Trust for Public Land "2020 ParkScore" Regional Plan Association “New City Parks” campaign  Act as a liaison to ensure cross agency collaboration on citywide public space projects NYC needs a comprehensive vision for its parks and public spaces. A new Director of the Public Realm position, as outlined by NY4P and the Municipal Art Society, would set the agenda for the future and ensure that plans and agencies are collaborating to advance an open space vision across NYC. Resources: NY4P and the Municipal Art Society “A Public Champion for the Public Realm”  Commit to creative proposals including greenways and Open Streets While it is not possible to build large parks in some parts of the city, NYC must provide easier and safer access to existing parks and embrace creative strategies to develop public spaces. NYC should expand the greenway network and invest in the existing network of community gardens to enhance access for New Yorkers in communities that lack parks and open spaces. Further, the next administration must expand the Open Streets plan to create additional public spaces in areas that lack access to parks and playgrounds.

See their responses at Candidates on Parks . Mayor Eric Adams Mayor Eric Adams  Eric Adams  Would you as mayor commit to allocating 1% of the city budget to Parks? Yes, in fact I called for this back in 2018 when I released “The Pulse of Our Parks” report from Borough Hall. We need to support our city parks that provide so many vital services to this city. In the moments of this pandemic our green spaces provided a place for us to gather, express ourselves, and too simply catch a breath of fresh air. We need to do everything we can to preserve the future generations of New Yorkers the right to these essential parks. Would you support the creation of a Director of the Public Realm to oversee the holistic planning of parks, streets, sidewalks, plaza, waterfronts, natural areas? Yes, I would support the creation of such a position to oversee the holistic planning of our parks, streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts, and natural areas. Would you commit to a policy of developing parks and playgrounds so that all New Yorkers have access to parks and open space within a 10 minute walk? Yes, in my “A Greener City, A Brighter Future” plan for New York, I specifically note my plan to allow all New Yorkers regardless of the neighborhood they live in to have access to open, green space. This includes opening dozens of new public spaces, closing the park equity gap in high-need, underserved neighborhoods, and transforming 100 asphalt schoolyards into green community playgrounds. I am also calling to create a “Safe Routes to Parks” program which will build out protected bike and pedestrian infrastructure to safely connect neighborhoods far from large open spaces to destination parks. How would you create a more equitable parks system for NYC? As I mentioned above, an equitable parks system starts with funding for the agency and accessibility for New Yorkers. I will commit to spending one percent of the budget on parks services. I am calling to create a “Safe Routes to Parks'' program which will build out protected bike and pedestrian infrastructure to safely connect neighborhoods far from large open spaces to destination parks. In addition, every New Yorker knows we can’t grow more land so I will begin a program that will recapture land lost to Robert Moses-era highway projects. That means jump-starting projects like the BQGreen and PX Forward, as well as mapping and analyzing additional opportunities across the five boroughs to recapture lost land and reconnect our communities. Creating a more equitable parks system has been a priority for me as borough president, evidenced by my investments in perimeter access projects to underserved communities on the edges of both Prospect and Fort Greene parks. How would you reform the capital process so we can more effectively address the growing backlog in deferred parks maintenance projects across the city? I am running for Mayor to eliminate all the government inefficiencies that have restricted services and opportunities to so many New Yorkers. For example, we can directly address the capital process and we can do so by expanding the role of franchises to handle capital projects in our parks. We will partner with conservancies who can execute work faster and cheaper than the City. This will allow us to open up opportunities, complete important projects, and provide essential park services.   City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams  Council Speaker Adrienne Adams committed to funding NYC Parks at 1%, reforming the city's capital process, and creating a Director of the Public Realm. Here are her answers to our Speaker Candidates Forum: A New Vision for Open Space , which we hosted in partnership with New York League of Conservation Voters, Regional Plan Association, and Center for an Urban Future. Also present were Council Speaker Candidates Diana Ayala, Justin Brannan, Gale Brewer, Francisco Moya, Keith Powers, and Carlina Rivera who all endorsed the same ideas.  Adrienne Adams  New York City’s Parks have been underfunded and under-resourced for decades, with funding frequently being cut. Most cities commit between 1-4 percent of their city budget to parks. Do you support 1% for NYC Parks as Mayor Elect Adams has? And how will you ensure that parks funding isn’t cut in the future as we saw with devastating results during the pandemic? Yes, absolutely, I support a 1% commitment in the budget for NYC Parks. During the FY21 budget, which was passed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our City saw an $84 million cut to the Parks Department budget. That represented 14% of their operating budget, which absolutely devastated our parks. It led to 1,700 fewer maintenance and seasonal staff to help maintain our parks and playgrounds, and we saw the decline in the conditions of our green and open spaces. The budget cut also deeply impacted Parks Enforcement Patrol officers, Urban Park Rangers, the GreenThumb program, and more. That’s why in the FY22 budget, we restored the funding for the Parks Department to pre-pandemic levels, and brought back the crucial park workers who keep our parks safe, clean, and maintained.  As recent reports from the Center for an Urban Future have shown, the city's process for designing and building capital projects is badly broken. A new park bathroom can easily cost $3 million and recent library construction projects have cost more than $1,500 per square foot -- roughly triple the cost of building a Class A office building. As a result, NYC's limited capital dollars don't go nearly far enough to help meet the full range of infrastructure needs. As Speaker, what would you do to help reform this process, bring down costs, speed up timelines, and help deliver more vital social infrastructure projects for New Yorkers? Reforming our design and construction process is key to ensuring that infrastructure projects are completed not just in a timely fashion, but also on budget. We saw that with the use of design-build, we were able to speed up the vendor selection process without sacrificing the end product. We must build off of this new way of doing business, but also open up new doors of opportunity for Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (MWBE) firms that are qualified and can get the job done efficiently and effectively. Secondly, the City Council must exercise its oversight role to ensure that city agencies are operating at their maximum capacity and ability. We often hear from residents and organizations that they are frustrated by the red-tape and delays in crucial infrastructure projects that have tremendous benefit for the entire community. In my opinion, it’s key that we dig deeper into why these delays exist, and hold accountable those who are responsible for moving these projects along. Parks are often cut when the city is struggling financially, as we saw during the height of the pandemic in 2020, we lost critical parks funding when New Yorkers needed open spaces the most. What can the Council do to ensure parks will be funded through hard times and that they can receive consistent funding for staff and programs? We have to protect the Parks budget from being slashed, even during hard fiscal times like we saw during the height of the pandemic. Parks are essential to every New Yorker, and that was reinforced even more during the pandemic. In future budgets, we must baseline funding for our parks and park workers moving forward. I am committed to championing our green spaces to ensure we don’t see a situation like we saw in past years. NYC’s public realm (parks, plazas, waterfronts, streets, sidewalks) are all managed by different agencies often with different rules and priorities, rather than working as a connected network. Would you support the creation of a Director of the Public Realm? Yes, we should create a centralized place in City government that can oversee and manage all of our City’s different public spaces. The pandemic has truly underscored the importance of our public parks, plazas, waterfronts, and streets. The responsibility to maintain these public spaces is far too dispersed, and it creates a system of confusion and lack of accountability. Consolidating this into one office or Director position is definitely a positive step forward to ensuring that we have all of our public spaces managed and maintained to the best of our ability.  During the pandemic, programs like Open Streets and Open Restaurants were innovations by necessity that extended a lifeline to communities across the city and literally thousands of small businesses. What is your vision for a successful, equitable and permanent iteration of these programs to support our city and recovery? Open Streets and Open Restaurants saved so many of our small businesses at a time when the industry was really falling apart due to the pandemic. It also gave our residents a chance to enjoy their favorite open spaces safely. We should continue this program and tweak it to address outstanding concerns from neighbors and other stakeholders. This initiative has been a great boon for our City, and it came at the right time. But we should also tailor the program to meet the needs of every neighborhood, whether it’s in Queens, Brooklyn, or Staten Island. We shouldn’t have a one-size-fits-all Open Streets program because every neighborhood is different. I believe a successful and equitable Open Streets and Open Restaurants program will thrive moving forward in our City. Transportation Alternatives’ 25x25 plan seeks to reclaim 25% of our street space for pedestrians by 2025. Do you support this proposal, and how can the council lead work to prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, buses, and pedestrian plazas over cars? Transportation Alternatives’ 25x25 plan is certainly worth strong consideration and we will work to ensure that our City creates more space for pedestrians. Especially in the densest parts of our City, we need more space for pedestrians to get where they need to go, and to do so safely. I believe that with the proper community and stakeholder engagement, and taking into consideration neighborhood concerns, we can transform our streetscape to be safer and more equitable. As we saw this summer during Hurricane Ida, our city remains vulnerable to flooding and the impacts of climate change. How would you make our streets more resilient, and put in place policies that help prevent flooding across the sewer system and into places with damaging consequences like our subway stations and basement homes? We must invest in more green infrastructure as a method of making our City more resilient. Our parks and playgrounds can play a critical role in relieving some of the flooding that takes place now on our streets, and seep into basement homes and subway stations. Infrastructure like rain gardens are also essential to transform our streetscape, and it’s something we can invest in right now. Southeast Queens in particular has some of the oldest sewer infrastructure that needs to be upgraded, and it’s in places like these that we must see the most investment. Parks are critical green infrastructure that helps to keep our city resilient in the face of extreme storms, heat, and other climate-induced disasters. As Speaker, how will you invest in parks and green space to help improve our city's resilience? We have to continue to reimagine our parks and playgrounds into spaces that can contribute to resiliency. For example, earlier this month at PS 223Q in my district, we cut the ribbon on a new playground that was designed by the students and incorporated many green features with the help of the Department of Environmental Protection. That project, which was led by the Trust for Public Land and funded by New York Road Runners, required collaboration from all parties, but it was ultimately a great project for everyone involved. We need more partnerships like these to ensure that our parks and playgrounds, both big and small, became the public spaces that we need to not only provide fresh air and ample space, but also help fight back climate change. That starts with partnerships and investments, which I am committed to doing in the next City Council. Parks and green spaces are often sparse in Environmental Justice neighborhoods, where rates of air pollution and extreme heat are already high. How can the NYC council work to prioritize equity in their work to support parks and green spaces? What are some initiatives you would like to champion? Equity must be at the center of this work when it comes to combating environmental racism and injustice. For example, we see that fossil fuel infrastructure is often planned and placed within communities of color, leading to higher-than-average asthma rates and other adverse health impacts that have long-lasting impacts on the children of our community. And we know that climate change will – and has already – impacted coastal communities, which are often home to marginalized communities of color. To address this inequity, we have to invest deeply in parks and green spaces where these inequities exist. Programs like the Community Parks Initiative have proven successful, and we should work to ensure that we build on those successes. Secondly, we have to prioritize the voices of the marginalized who are living in Environmental Justice neighborhoods. In the next City Council, we will center their voices and concerns, and tackle the health and environmental issues that have affected them for far too long.

NYC Resources 311 Office of the Mayor         About NYC DOT NYC Streets Plan Overview Resources Contact Us Update 2025 NYC DOT announced historic street safety and accessibility improvements under the Adams administration, including record measures to protect cyclists, safeguard pedestrians, enhance intersections, make it easier for people with low-vision to use our streets, improve bus service, and more. Press Release: NYC DOT Highlights Historic Street Safety and Accessibility Improvements Under Adams Administration Press Release: NYC DOT Highlights Historic Street Safety and Accessibility Improvements Under Adams Administration Overview The future of New York City is one where everyone has access to reliable and environmentally-friendly transportation options, as well as safe and welcoming streets and public spaces. NYC DOT developed the NYC Streets Plan , a five-year transportation plan to improve the safety, accessibility, and quality of the City’s streets for all New Yorkers. The plan involves an in-depth analysis of the current state of New York City’s streets and responds equitably to the uniqueness of the City’s many neighborhoods and local needs. In December 2019, Local Law 195 directed NYC DOT to issue and implement a transportation master plan every five  years. The law requires NYC DOT to publish an annual update on the plan. The  updates highlight new initiatives, report progress, and update maps with  finished and potential projects.

Updated on April 2, 2025 by MHNA No Comments on Sarah Batchu (District 2 City Council candidate) – Meet the Candidates 2025! The Murray Hill Neighborhood Association reached out to all the candidates running for office in 2025 that intersect our neighborhood (Mayor, Manhattan Borough President, City Council District 2, and City Council District 4, etc.) with questions sourced directly from our members via our Ask the Candidates questionnaire . See the candidate’s answers below. How you would improve our streets and quality of life? Improving our streets and quality of life requires a thoughtful and balanced approach, one that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions. Our neighborhoods face real challenges—individuals who need support to stabilize their lives, alongside residents who are understandably concerned about safety due to issues like public drug use, harassment, and violent crime. As a public servant, I understand that with the resources we already have, we can make our neighborhoods safer and cleaner. Every city agency must work together to address these concerns. When necessary, law enforcement can play a role, especially in high-need areas, to ensure public safety laws are enforced. However, law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. I’ve seen firsthand how effective collaboration can bring about meaningful change. While working in City Hall, I witnessed how a coordinated task force—bringing together agencies like the Department of Sanitation and the Department of Health—helped tackle quality of life challenges on 125th Street. This type of coordinated effort is what our neighborhoods need, and as your Council Member, I will bring all relevant agencies to the table to ensure we’re making real progress. At the same time, we must address the root causes of these issues. Enforcement alone won’t solve everything—if it could, the city’s current approach would have already fixed these problems. That’s why we need a comprehensive strategy that includes not only public safety measures but also investments in housing, mental health services, education, and job opportunities. By tackling the root causes of homelessness, crime, and public health issues, we can create lasting change that improves the lives of all our residents. How are you going to handle the illegal migrant situation that has escalated into NYC? New York City has always been a city of immigrants, and our district has a proud history of welcoming new neighbors while ensuring long-term residents can continue to thrive. But right now, federal inaction on immigration has left New York City to deal with a crisis without the necessary resources. The mayor’s mismanagement has only made things worse—wasting taxpayer dollars on ineffective policies instead of investing in real solutions that benefit everyone. The biggest strain has been on housing, and unfortunately, the mayor has taken an approach that is both unsustainable and fiscally irresponsible. Instead of prioritizing cost-effective, permanent housing solutions, his administration has relied on high-priced shelter providers charging nearly $400 per night—when rental assistance costs less than $80 per night. At the same time, his 30-day and 60-day shelter eviction rules are making our neighborhoods less safe by forcing more people onto the streets. These policies don’t just fail new arrivals—they fail all of us, driving up costs and making our homelessness crisis worse. As your Council Member, I will fight for policies that keep our neighborhoods stable and livable. That means ending these wasteful eviction policies and redirecting funds toward real housing solutions that work for both longtime residents and new arrivals, including strengthening rental assistance and expanding affordable housing. Of course, housing stability is tied to economic opportunity. Right now, the city’s bureaucracy is preventing asylum seekers from working legally, which only increases the burden on our social services. I will push the city to cut red tape and expand work authorization so that new migrants can contribute to our economy, as many would like to do. Beyond housing and jobs, true integration requires strong community networks. I will work alongside local organizations to ensure that new arrivals have the tools to succeed. That means expanding legal aid to help immigrants navigate their status and ensuring that our schools, hospitals, and public spaces are safe spaces for all to seek support. When the city takes a smart, coordinated approach, we can prevent the chaos we see now and build a district where longtime residents and new arrivals alike feel safe, supported, and secure—that’s the leadership I will bring to the Council. How can housing become more affordable and not just for low income candidates? I believe that affordable housing is not just a right for all but the foundation of a strong, thriving community, and every neighborhood has a role to play in creating new housing opportunities. Since my time at City Hall, I have championed policies to make housing more accessible, affordable, and sustainable for all New Yorkers. As Council Member, I will support the creation of new homes. Right now, New York City is facing a housing shortage, record low vacancy rates, and sky high rents. We need new housing units at all income levels if we want to decrease rents for everyone. We need to expand housing options with studio apartments for young people, larger units for growing families, and senior housing that allows New Yorkers to age in place with dignity. I will support innovative housing approaches such as office-to-residential conversions and co-locating housing over existing infrastructure like railyards or libraries to meet the moment. As Council Member, I will support the creation of new homes. New York City is currently facing a severe housing shortage, record low vacancy rates, and soaring rents. To lower rents for everyone, we need to build more housing at all income levels. This means expanding housing options with studio apartments for young people, larger units for growing families, and senior housing that allows New Yorkers to age in place with dignity. I will also advocate for innovative housing approaches like office-to-residential conversions and co-locating housing over existing infrastructure such as rail yards and libraries, maximizing underutilized spaces to meet the moment. In addition, I will work to expand homeownership opportunities by increasing funding for the Department of Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) down payment assistance program and affordable homeownership programs. This will make buying a home accessible to more New Yorkers, especially middle-income families who often find themselves priced out. I will also advocate for streamlining city regulations to support condo and coop owners who are working to maintain their homes. Finally, I will fight for a rent freeze for rent-stabilized tenants to protect renters from unfair rent increases. We cannot allow skyrocketing rents to push people out of their homes and neighborhoods, especially older adults aging in place. The need for affordable housing is urgent, and I will work tirelessly to make sure that every New Yorker has a home they can afford. How would you address homelessness and mental illness in NYC? In neighborhoods where homelessness and mental health struggles are a visible and growing challenge, the strain on the community is undeniable. It’s not just about seeing people in crisis—it’s about the real effects it has on our streets, our safety, and our overall sense of well-being. The issues of homelessness and mental illness require urgent, thoughtful action that acknowledges the unique needs of these communities. The immediate priority must be providing stable, permanent housing for those who are homeless. A Housing First approach offers individuals immediate access to housing, which is essential to their recovery and ability to rebuild their lives. For neighborhoods grappling with rising homelessness, this means expanding affordable housing options and supporting initiatives like rental assistance and rapid rehousing programs. When people are no longer living on the streets or in shelters, it reduces the visibility of the crisis in public spaces and allows neighborhoods to begin healing. However, housing alone isn’t a solution if we don’t address the interconnected issue of mental health. Many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in our neighborhoods also struggle with untreated mental health conditions, which can make their situation even more difficult. Over the years, New York City has seen the closure of numerous inpatient psychiatric beds, leaving fewer options for people in crisis. With local hospitals like Beth Israel closing, people who need urgent psychiatric care have nowhere to go. I will fight for more emergency care beds and advocate for increasing state investments to ensure that individuals experiencing mental health crises have a safe place to turn for help. But we can’t stop there. We need a system that ensures individuals transitioning out of care are not left without housing or support services. The lack of follow-up care after a mental health crisis is one of the reasons people end up back on the streets. A comprehensive solution means pairing housing with mental health services, substance abuse treatment, job training, and other essential resources. It’s about creating a system of support that stays with people, helping them stay stable in the long term. For neighbors living in areas with visible homelessness and mental health challenges, this isn’t just a political issue—it’s a daily reality. It’s about feeling safe in your community and knowing that people who are struggling are receiving the help they need to recover and reintegrate. With a comprehensive, compassionate approach, we can provide solutions that benefit both those experiencing homelessness and the broader community. By investing in both housing and mental health services, we can create neighborhoods that are safer, more stable, and more supportive for everyone. How would you support the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association? As a community advocate, I recognize that neighborhood associations like the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association (MHNA) are the foundation of a thriving community. As Council Member, I am committed to being actively involved with MHNA by regularly attending meetings and engaging with residents to stay informed about the challenges they face. By maintaining a consistent presence in the community, I will ensure that I have my ear to the ground and can effectively advocate for the needs of Murray Hill residents. In addition to direct engagement, I will work to secure discretionary funding from the City to support MHNA and its local initiatives sustainably. These funds will be vital in enhancing community projects, strengthening local programs, and addressing pressing neighborhood issues. I will prioritize an open, ongoing feedback loop between my office and MHNA leadership, ensuring I am always up to date on residents’ concerns. This collaboration will enable me to advocate for practical, actionable solutions, while ensuring that the MHNA has the necessary resources and support to continue its essential work. Bio I am a public servant and community health leader running for City Council because I believe New York City deserves more than business-as-usual politics—it needs leaders who truly care about the people. At a time when the city is grappling with rising rents, the disappearance of affordable housing, shuttered hospitals, and families being displaced from neighborhoods they have called home for generations, I am committed to bringing change. Raised in a family deeply rooted in service, my father, an immigrant from India, and my mother, the granddaughter of Jewish refugees, dedicated their lives to providing medical care to their community. Their commitment to dignity, compassion, and community shaped my values and inspired my career. From the earliest days of my career in New York City government at City Hall, I began tackling big issues head-on—like addressing the city’s crumbling public housing infrastructure and planning an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following my successful time at City Hall, I joined the Lower Eastside Girls Club as Chief of Staff and was part of the leadership team that launched the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness, an intergenerational community space dedicated to transforming self-care into community care. My vision for the city is grounded in care and equity, prioritizing affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, and opportunities for every New Yorker to thrive. https://sarahbatchu.nyc/ Share: Sarah Batchu (District 2 City Council candidate) – Meet the Candidates 2025!

Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Volunteer Volunteer We Need a New Generation of Leadership. Rising rents, shuttered hospitals, and families pushed out of their homes—it’s time for change. Join the Movement Building a City that Cares Government used to care. It worked for us. But our leaders stopped solving problems and started putting personal gain over our needs. That’s why Sarah is running for City Council. It’s time for a New York that truly cares—a New York where healthcare is guaranteed, families aren’t drowning in childcare costs, and everyone has an affordable home in a safe neighborhood.​ Proudly Endorsed By Local and Political Organizations Local and Political Organizations Community Leaders Aishyalah Campbell , Former President, Haven Plaza Tenant Association Camino Lopez , Treasurer, NYCHA LES III Tenant Association Carmen Gonzalez , Former Board Member, Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association Charles Arnold , Co-President, Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats Charisse King , Vice President of Quality of Life, Three Bridges Democratic Club Chung Seto , President, United Democratic Organization Danielle Washington , Treasurer, MS/PS 54 Parent Teacher Association Danny Orlin , East Village Resident & Owner, Cafe Mogador Ed Brady , Greenwich Village Resident & Owner, the Comedy Shop Erika Sumner , Vice President, Washington Square Association Erma Campbell , Vice President, Haven Plaza Tenant Association Gio Chavarría , Local Small Business Owner & East Village Native Grauven Olivares , Board Member, Community Education Council 1 Jamie Felber , Local Small Business Owner & Former Community Board 3 Member Jasmin Sanchez , President, Three Bridges Democratic Club Jess Beck , Co-Founder, East Village Neighbors Who Care Joel Rodriguez , Lower East Side Native & Owner, Free Advice Barber Shop Kathleen Collins , Disability Advocate and Attorney Kathryn Konkle , Original Member of the 6BC Botanical Garden Magda Napoleon , District Leader, 65th Assembly District, Part B Mary Monroe , Secretary, NYCHA Lillian Wald Houses Tenant Association Melanie Aucello , President, 344 E 28th Street NYCHA Tenant Association Melissa Martinez , Member of Three Bridges Democratic Club Nat Esten , East Village Resident & Owner, Book Club Norma Nazario , Safety Advocate Ramya Guttikonda-Taylor , Chef, Small Business Owner, & Former East Village Resident Renee Kinsella , Vice President, 29th Street Block Association Ryder Kessler , Community Board 2 Member & Former State Assembly Candidate Sabina Brunetti , Local Public School Parent & Small Business Owner Sabura Rashid , President, NYCHA LES III Tenant Association Susan Finelli , Director, 29th Street Block Association Taquan Pugh , Local Community Organizer & Public School Teacher Tyler Hefferon , Executive Director, EV Loves Virginia Kee , Co-Founder of Chinese-American Planning Council 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009  174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 team@sarahbatchu.nyc  team@sarahbatchu.nyc (‪347) 620-1238‬  (‪347) 620-1238‬  Facebook-f Facebook-f Twitter Twitter Linkedin-in Linkedin-in Instagram Instagram Paid For By Batchu For Council       Loading Comments...

Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Home Meet Sarah Our Platform Our District News Donate Volunteer Volunteer Meet Sarah Sarah is a public servant, nonprofit leader, and committed activist for better healthcare and housing. She’s running to transform New York City into a place where everyone can feel safe and cared for. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. As a student at Barnard College, Sarah’s commitment to service deepened even further as she responded to the movement around campus sexual assault. As a survivor, Sarah intimately understood the toll that a lack of safety could take on the mind and body. With the guidance of fellow survivors and community activists across the city, she transformed her own pain into an ongoing commitment to building a safer city for all—and has had a results-driven career in public service ever since. From the earliest days of her career in New York City government at City Hall, Sarah began tackling the big issues head-on—like addressing the city’s crumbling public housing infrastructure and planning an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In just a few short years, Sarah’s dedication and tenacity yielded remarkable, proven results for thousands of New Yorkers:  Sarah raised millions to build innovative public programs serving New Yorkers from all walks of life, including women , immigrants , and people with disabilities . Sarah successfully advocated for reforms to increase access to safe and affordable housing for formerly justice-involved New Yorkers. Sarah designed, launched, and managed Get Help NYC, a groundbreaking online platform that became the city’s primary resource hub during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sarah worked directly with public housing residents to enshrine their rights into law and to give them a voice in the renovation of their homes. Sarah raised over $7 million in rental assistance for tenants facing COVID-19-related financial hardship, ensuring housing stability for undocumented New Yorkers and gig workers left out of State and Federal programs.  Following her successful time at City Hall, Sarah joined the Lower Eastside Girls Club as Chief of Staff and was part of the leadership team that launched the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness , an intergenerational community space dedicated to transforming self-care into community care. Within two years, Sarah and her neighbors brought this vision to life, creating a thriving space with over 1,000 members on the Lower East Side. Sarah’s personal and professional experience continues to reinforce her mission to lead in the creation of healing spaces and supportive communities. And, above all, Sarah remains firmly rooted in her belief that all New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in their communities and in the best city in the world. 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009  174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 team@sarahbatchu.nyc  team@sarahbatchu.nyc (‪347) 620-1238‬  (‪347) 620-1238‬  Facebook-f Facebook-f Twitter Twitter Linkedin-in Linkedin-in Instagram Instagram Paid For By Batchu For Council       Loading Comments...

VAWA permits immigrant survivors of domestic violence to file for an immigrant visa petition on their own, without the knowledge of their U.S. citizen or permanent resident abuser. Learn more about VAWA U and T Visas Immigrant victims of certain serious crimes, such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, may be able to get special visas, specifically a U visa or a T visa. The U visa (for victims of serious crimes) and T visa (for victims of human trafficking) protect victims who help law enforcement in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of those crimes. U and T visas provide the following benefits: Temporary, renewable immigration status for up to 4 years. Allow you to apply for employment authorization. Allow you to apply for temporary status for certain family members. Allow U/T visa holders and certain family members to apply for permanent residence (a "green card"). In the state of New York, eligibility for cash assistance, Medicaid, and other public benefits.

Some ways you can plan for possible immigration enforcement includes: For those with status, carrying proof of status at all times. Creating an emergency plan for you and your family in case you are detained or deported. Choose an emergency contact and memorize their phone number.

Choose an emergency contact and memorize their phone number. This should be someone you trust or even your lawyer. Choose a standby guardian for your children. LawHelpNY and ILRC also have suggestions for how to plan for possible immigration enforcement. What is a standby guardian? Immigrant caregivers can appoint a “standby guardian” to take care of their child, in case they are separated from their child through immigration arrest, detention, or deportation. A “standby guardian” is a person who is acts as a “backup” caregiver in case the primary caregiver is unable to take care of the child because they are arrested or detained by immigration authorities or deported. Designating a standby guardian is not the same as giving up parental rights. Standby guardianship only goes into effect if a parent is separated from their child. not Standby guardians have the power to make important decisions for a child in their care, including medical decisions and decisions about where the child goes to school. There are no immigration status requirements to be a standby guardian. However, there are certain other requirements, so interested caregivers should consult with a lawyer to see if designating a standby guardian can help them plan for their children’s future. Immigrant caregivers may have additional options to help plan for the future, and should consult with a lawyer to discuss further. For free, safe immigration legal help, including help designating a standby guardian, you can call 1-800-354-0365 between 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday to Friday and say, "Immigration Legal."

How to Avoid Fraud If you need immigration legal advice, only go to a lawyer or someone who is accredited by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) or an organization recognized by the DOJ. Immigration assistance service providers are people or businesses that charge fees for any kind of immigration-related services. They are sometimes known as notarios públicos in Spanish-speaking communities, immigration "brokers," immigration "consultants," or "accountants" providing immigration assistance. Many immigration assistance service providers are not lawyers nor accredited/recognized by the DOJ and cannot give you legal advice . Learn more about what immigration assistance service providers can and cannot do for you . Immigration law is complicated. Beware of fraudulent providers who may indicate otherwise and make false promises, such as: An easy way to obtain a green card A way to get a work permit or visa immediately Statements indicating that there are no risks or consequences Claims of special influence with immigration authorities What Not to Do Do not pay for government application forms – forms are free and can be downloaded online at www.uscis.gov/forms Do not give original documents – give copies instead Do not sign any blank or incomplete forms Do not sign papers, immigration forms, or contracts that you do not fully understand What to Do Always ask questions – even if the provider was recommended by a family member or friend; you should feel confident about the provider Ask for proof that the provider is a licensed attorney or accredited/recognized by the DOJ Get a second opinion Only go to providers that have a physical location Ask for a written agreement that describes the services to be provided and is signed by the provider – read the agreement before signing it, and keep the signed copy for your records Get copies of documents prepared for you Ask for a written receipt that includes the name and address of the provider Filing a Complaint To file a complaint about immigration assistance service providers, call 311 and say "immigration service provider" or visit the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection website at nyc.gov/dca to file a complaint in your language.

Common Scams "10-Year Visa" Scam In the "10-Year Visa" scam, unscrupulous attorneys and immigration assistance service providers tell immigrants that they can obtain a visa or green card if they have lived in the United States for 10 years. These scammers typically fail to adequately explain that to pursue this, individuals must enter deportation proceedings and prove "extreme, unusual, and exceptional hardship" to a qualifying family member. Phone Scam Targeting Chinese Speakers Scammers are calling and leaving voicemails in Mandarin from numbers appearing to originate from mainland China and claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy, Chinese Consulates, or Chinese law enforcement agencies. These callers request that you pick up a package or, alternatively, provide personal financial information, such as bank account or credit card information, to avoid issues with your legal status, or to avoid arrest the next time you travel to China. Scammers are reportedly targeting Chinese immigrants or people with Chinese last names. The incoming phone number for these scams is often similar to the recipient's own number or to the Chinese Embassy's real number, 212-244-XXXX. The scammers are also using email and WeChat in their attempts to defraud people. If you think you’ve been scammed, you can call 311 and ask to connect with your local police precinct to file a police report. The NYPD does not ask about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or other people who ask for help. Services are available in Chinese and other languages.

The New York City Charter The City Charter establishes and explains the roles of various City agencies and offices. The Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) was created by Chapter 1, Section 18. The Charter declares that MOIA’s purpose is to promote the safety and well-being of the City and all of its residents, regardless of national origin or language spoken, by ensuring all New Yorkers can access City services, programs, and benefits. Mayoral Executive Orders Executive Orders 34 & 41 Executive Orders 34 and 41 act as a policy that allows all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status, to access important City services without inquiry or disclosure of their immigration status (with several exceptions). Read Executive Order 34 of 2003 Read Executive Order 41 of 2003 Executive Order 120 Executive Order 120 requires that all City agencies that provide services to the public create a “language access plan” to ensure that those that do not speak English can still access city services. Read Executive Order 120 of 2008 Executive Order 128 Executive Order 128 officially creates Immigrant Heritage Week, an annual Citywide program of outreach and education that celebrates the histories and traditions of the City's diverse immigrant communities. Immigrant Heritage Week is held every April. You can learn more on the Immigrant Heritage Celebration page . Local Laws Local Law 30 Local Law 30 (LL 30) is the City’s language access law, which improves access to City services for all individuals. ‎LL 30 requires covered agencies to appoint language access coordinators, translate commonly distributed documents into the top ten languages most widely spoken in the City, provide telephonic interpretation in at least 100 languages, and develop and implement language access implementation plans, among other requirements. Read Local Law 30 of 2017 Local Law 31 Local Law 31 is the City's "Immigration Service Provider Law."

Any MOUs covered by this law will be posted on MOIA’s Memoranda of Understanding page . Read Local Law 40 of 2011 Local Law 73 Local Law 73 is also known as the “Equal Access to Human Services Law.” This City law strengthens language access services for people with limited English skills who are seeking important health and human services. The law places requirements on the Human Resources Administration (HRA), the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS), the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS). Read Local Law 73 of 2003 Local Law 228 Local Law 228, which is sometimes called New York City’s “sanctuary city law,” prohibits the use of city resources and time in furtherance of federal immigration enforcement. The law also requires recordkeeping of any requests to the City asking to assist with immigration enforcement. Read Local Law 228 of 2017 New York City Administrative Code Sometimes called “the NYC Detainer Laws,” these three laws are meant to balance public safety with the City's commitment to being a welcoming and safe place for immigrant families. These laws impose certain limitations on the City’s criminal legal system to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These laws apply to the NYC Department of Correction (DOC), Department of Probation (DOP), and Police Department (NYPD). Read the Detainer Law for the Department of Correction (DOC): Title 9, Chapter 1, § 9-131 Read the Detainer Law for the Department of Probation (DOP): Title 9, Chapter 2, § 9-205 Read the Detainer Law for the Police Department (NYPD): Title 14, Chapter 1, § 14-154 If you have been convicted of certain “violent or serious crimes” or if your name is a possible match on a terrorist screening database, then the DOC, DOP, or NYPD may be permitted to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The types of criminal convictions that are considered “violent or serious crimes” for the purpose of honoring an immigration detainer are found in Local Law 58 of 2014 and Local Law 59 of 2014 . View a list of "covered crimes" under which the City will cooperate with detainer requests . New York City Human Rights Law The City's Human Rights Law protects against illegal discrimination, including discrimination based on immigration status. All New Yorkers deserve fairness and respect, regardless of immigration status. In New York City, it is illegal for employers, landlords, and others to discriminate against you based on your race, religious beliefs, color, age, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, and other grounds. The New York City Human Rights law protects you from discrimination in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodation. It also protects you from retaliation, bias-related harassment, and bias-based profiling by law enforcement. For more information about unlawful discrimination and how you can make a complaint, visit the New York City Commission on Human Rights or call 311.

The federal government is no longer accepting or processing applications. It’s still unclear how this change will affect people who are already in the U.S. through this program. We are waiting for more information from the federal government and will share updates as soon as they become available. If you are impacted by this change, we encourage you to stay informed through the government's website: www.uscis.gov/chnv. You can call the MOIA Immigration Legal Support Hotline at 800-354-0365 for information on how and where to find City-funded, free, and safe immigration legal help. What is the CHNV Program? The program allows nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who are outside the United States and lack U.S. entry documents to be considered, on a case-by-case basis, for advanced authorization to travel and a temporary period for up to two years, during which they may live and work in the United States.

Menu   Text Size   Search Search  Primary Navigation The official website of NYC Home NYC Resources NYC311 Office of the Mayor Events Connect Jobs NYC.gov Privacy Policy     Print Collection of Information by NYC.gov In order to improve the content and usability of this website,  the City of New York (the "City") automatically collects several categories  of information from users. This information includes the following: The apparent Internet  Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service Provider  ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address  assigned directly to it. 1 The apparent Fully  Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of your Internet Service  Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain  name assigned directly to it. 2 The type of browser (such as, for example Internet Explorer,  Opera, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a  user's computer. The date and time a user  visited the site. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications  used and forms data. The Uniform Resource  Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to NYC.gov (if  detectable), if such user did not connect directly to NYC.gov, or use it as a  homepage or "Portal". The City uses this information to identify site performance  needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors,  and to generally add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. In order to  accomplish those goals, from time to time, the City may conduct statistical  analysis of the data it collects. The City does not collect data for commercial or marketing  purposes, 3 and the City does  not sell,  exchange, or otherwise distribute the data collected by NYC.gov for commercial  or marketing purposes. Information Submitted to NYC.gov During a session on  NYC.gov, a user may affirmatively submit information to the City by, among  other means, electronic mail ("e-mail"), filling in and submitting an  on-line form, screening for benefits and services, or electing to personalize  NYC.gov and use it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted  information is stored in a secure environment, and will be used by the City in  furtherance of its duties and/or obligations to its citizenry (i.e.,  "governmental purposes"). 4 The governmental purposes to which your affirmatively submitted  information may include, but are not limited to, the following: Helping the City respond to  a request for information not readily available from NYC.gov Investigating a problem  reported to the City via NYC.gov 5 Keeping lists of parties  interested in some particular issue or facet of New York City life about which  the City anticipates issuing further information in the future. Sending informational updates and conducting outreach on topics such as, but  not limited to, public benefits and services and upcoming City events. Sharing information with other City agencies or offices or other government  agencies for the limited purpose of facilitating services and benefits, in  accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Disclosure of such information  pursuant to a request made under Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL")  or court order, if such information is not protected by federal, or state, or  local law. 6 The City does not rent or sell personally identifiable  information (e.g., information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail,  etc., or other information that identifies or could lead to the identification  of a user as a particular person), nor would the City exchange or trade such  information with third-parties without a user's explicit permission. The City  does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable financial  information other than as necessary to complete a credit card or other  financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user. If a NYC.gov user has elected not to receive further information  from the City, NYC.gov will not send such information. If a NYC.gov user has  elected to receive further communication from the City, NYC.gov will only send  information in categories that are authorized by the user. If NYC.gov sends  electronic mail ("e-mail") to a user, such e-mail is NOT confidentia l, 7 and is identical in  nature to that information generally available to the public and news media. Security and Monitoring In  certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a  password to access or submit personally identifiable information. One should  not divulge a password to anyone, and the City will never ask a user for a  password in a telephone call, fax, e-mail or other form of unsolicited  communication. When a user is finished with an application or applications that  are password protected, such user should exit the relevant page(s). If the  browser used to access said password protected pages is a publicly-accessible  browser, users should close down the entire session and, if applicable or  possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password might  be stored subsequent to use, and log out of all applications. The City has integrated industry standard or better security measures  and systems into the design, implementation and day to day operation of NYC.gov  and its underlying servers and networks. 8 Furthermore, the City maintains ongoing efforts to identify and/or block  unauthorized intrusions into or onto NYC.gov, and to upload to or change  information on or otherwise cause damage to NYC.gov or the information resident  hereon or submitted hereto. 9 The  act of using NYC.gov constitutes the User’s express consent to the City’s monitoring  of all uses of the system. If such monitoring reveals possible evidence of  criminal activity or any other unauthorized use, system administration  personnel may provide your information to law enforcement or other officials,  as authorized or required by law. Cookies Cookies are text files, or  entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website,  and to track information during multiple visits to a website. The City uses  "temporary cookies" 10 on some parts of NYC.gov,  and such temporary cookies expire upon the end of the browsing session. This  website and NYC.gov generally, do not use "persistent cookies." 11 However, if a user registers to use NYC.gov as a customized  portal, the City uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. The  City may also use persistent cookies to understand the distribution and  patterns of unique and repeat visitors for 311 Online and other sites on  NYC.gov to enhance their accessibility.  Web Bugs (a/k/a Web Beacons) NYC.gov does not use web  bugs 12 on its web pages or in any  html e-mail generated by use of the portal, or otherwise sent from NYC.gov, for  any purpose other than to identify site performance needs; to ensure  compatibility with the technology used by NYC.gov's visitors, and to generally  add and improve services offered on NYC.gov. Children No applications on NYC.gov specifically solicit information from minors or seek  to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such  information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of  NYC.gov should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to  NYC.gov by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as  information given by an adult and may become subject to FOIL. The City strongly believes that parental supervision is an  important factor in Internet use by minors. Therefore, NYC.gov asks parents to  guide their minor children when children are asked to provide any personal  information online. NYC.gov further asks that children ask for and receive  their parent's permission before providing any information online. Health Care Information Any agency  subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and  its regulations (collectively, "HIPAA") that creates, receives,  maintains, or transmits via NYC.gov any Protected Health Information  (“PHI”), as that term is defined by HIPAA,  must comply with HIPAA’s Privacy and Security Rules.  The agency must also  require its Business Associates, as that term is defined by HIPAA, to comply  with HIPAA when, on behalf of the agency, each such Business Associate creates,  receives, maintains, or transmits PHI hosted by NYC.gov.   Nothing stated herein shall be interpreted  to diminish the compliance requirements imposed by any other applicable law or  City policy. Third Party Links NYC.gov provides links to,  and may be linked from, local, State and federal government agencies, and from,  or to, other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links neither  constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s)  or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s),  accessibility or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s).  Nor does any link between NYC.gov and a third-party website imply sponsorship  of such website, or the creator of such website Some content on portions of  NYC.gov resides on servers run by third parties. 13 Each agency providing  content for NYC.gov is bound by NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Any agency using a  third-party host, ISP, ASP or other combination of third-party transport,  storage, content or application provision services shall require such third  party  to comply with NYC.gov's Privacy Policy. Intellectual Property The content of NYC.gov's webpages is copyrighted, and contains some third party  images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are notified, therefore,  that one should presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder  before reproducing or otherwise using images/graphics from this website. NYC.gov may change this policy from time to time, and reserves  the right to do so without notice.  Privacy Statement Footnotes 1 An IP address is a numeric  value assigned to an Internet Service Provider, a computer network, an  individual computer or router, or a firewall (collectively, "users")  so that other computers on the Internet may direct Internet message or other  traffic to such users. Until the IP addressing system is changed, an IP address  will take the form of XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, where the X's are numbers between 1 and  9, and 0 for some positions. The term “user” may also refer to an individual  who has created an account on NYC.gov and any of its subpages. Go Back 2 A Domain Name is an alphanumeric value that represents the plain language (English or such other local language as is relevant) translation of the IP address assigned to a specific user or collection of users. For example, if a user had an IP address of 123.123.123.123, the Domain Name that represented that address might be WWW.HOME.COM. Go Back 3 Commercial and non-commercial marketing purposes include, for the purposes of this policy, Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail (colloquially known as "SPAM" e-mail), targeted e-mail for the purpose of selling products, or the sale or exchange of personally identifiable information between parties that anticipate receiving value in exchange for such information. Go Back 4 The City of New York's duties and obligations toward its citizens are set forth in the City Charter and in all applicable and relevant federal, state, and local law. Go Back 5 When  the City is investigating a problem reported to NYC.gov, the information you have  submitted through NYC.gov may be seen by various people.
