0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Meet Zellnor State Senator Zellnor Myrie has emerged as one of New York’s most respected legislators and a fierce champion on issues ranging from gun safety and criminal justice to voting rights and abortion rights to health care and affordable housing. From his first day in office he has been relentlessly focused on making New York more affordable and livable for all of us who call it home. Focused on Affordability Elected in 2018 from Central Brooklyn, Myrie was part of the crusading class of Democrats who finally ended decades of Republican control in the State Capitol. In his first six months in office, he helped pass the Reproductive Health Act to guarantee abortion rights in New York, groundbreaking climate change legislation , the Child Victims Act and tougher gun control laws , and the strongest pro-tenant rent laws in a generation. The New York Times hailed that extraordinary first session as a “heartening display of public service.” “dynamic and passionate” — 8/28/18 Over the past five years, Senator Myrie has led the fight to bring the State’s antiquated voting laws into the 21st century. As Chair of the Senate’s Elections Committee, he pushed to introduce early voting to New York, closed the LLC loophole that gave the rich a backdoor path to evade contribution limits, and authored the John R. Lewis New York Voting Rights Act , which the NAACP and Brennan Center both praised as the strongest voting rights law in the nation. A powerful advocate for affordable housing , Senator Myrie has championed key efforts to protect both tenants and homeowners—passing strong new rent laws to help vulnerable tenants, creating new paths to homeownership, and crafting legislation to stop deed theft. Senator Myrie has led vital efforts to enhance public safety while ensuring a fairer criminal justice system. He cracked down on unscrupulous gun dealers and manufacturers by writing the nation’s first state-level gun industry liability law to keep dangerous weapons out of our neighborhoods. And working with business leaders and criminal justice reform advocates, Myrie wrote and fought to pass the Clean Slate Act , which gives more individuals who have paid their debt to society a chance to restart their lives and find good jobs. Senator Myrie continues to champion policies that help working families — like his advocacy for universal afterschool programs — and to defend underserved, vulnerable New Yorkers, including his leadership in fighting the closure of SUNY Downstate hospital. And Myrie has been a strong advocate for LGBTQIA equality and the rights of immigrants. Prior to his election to the State Senate, Myrie served as an associate at Davis, Polk & Wardwell where he clocked over 600 hours of pro bono legal work in a single year. Before that, he worked as a Legislative Director in the New York City Council, where he played a key role in drafting the Tenants’ Bill of Rights. Myrie was born and raised in Central Brooklyn and is a product of New York City public schools. Raised by a mother who continues to inspire him, his parents came to New York from Costa Rica over 40 years ago drawn by the promise and opportunity the city has always offered hardworking immigrants. Senator Myrie is a graduate of Fordham University and Cornell Law School. He and his wife, former Assemblymember Diana Richardson, live in Central Brooklyn.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Results for New Yorkers Fighting for Affordable Housing Zellnor Myrie is recognized as one of the most powerful advocates for affordable housing in the state legislature. In the face of the worst affordable housing crisis in generations, he helped lead the fight to protect tenants and preserve affordable apartments by passing the strongest rent laws in a generation . He’s been a strong voice for NYCHA residents, demanding speedy repairs of their units and the removal of unsightly scaffolding that lingers for years. He passed legislation to protect homeowners from deed theft , and wrote legislation to give more New Yorkers an opportunity to purchase the homes they rent and expand longtime homeowners’ eligibility for tax credits. And prior to his election to the State Senate, he helped craft the Tenants’ Bill of Rights as a Legislative Director in the New York City Council. Stopping Gun Violence From his first day in office, Zellnor Myrie has advanced a broad range of policies to stem gun violence in New York. He wrote and passed the first law in the nation to crack down on irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers and hold them accountable. He’s voted to ban body armor sales in New York, limit access to semiautomatic rifles, and expand the state’s red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others. Myrie has also worked to strengthen the state’s concealed-carry laws and expand violence intervention programs in our communities. In recognition of his leadership, Myrie was named the “Gun Sense Lawmaker of the Year” by Everytown for Gun Safety in 2021. Strengthening Public Education A product of New York City’s public school system, Senator Zellnor Myrie has been a fierce champion for public education in the state. He fought to deliver record aid to New York City’s public schools —ending decades of funding inequity—to give teachers the resources they need to succeed in our classrooms. He’s been an outspoken advocate for universal pre-K and for fully supporting our state-funded higher education across the state. And, this year, Myrie has spearheaded the call for free, universal after-school programs to help working parents and keep kids on the right track. Enhancing Voting Rights As Chair of the Senate’s Elections Committee, Zellnor Myrie has led the charge to bring New York’s antiquated voting laws into the 21st century and make the state a national leader in protecting voting rights. Among his most important reform efforts was introducing early voting across the state and closing the LLC loophole, which had long allowed wealthy donors to evade contribution limits. Myrie is the author of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York , which the Brennan Center for Justice said offers “the country’s strongest protections against racial discrimination in voting.” Tackling Climate Change Understanding the urgency of the moment, one of Senator Zellnor Myrie’s top priorities in his first term was to pass the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, described by the New York Times as “one of the world’s most ambitious climate plans.” The law’s emission goals and requirements have helped set the pace for the nation. Since then, Myrie has written the groundbreaking Climate Negligence Act, which would hold big oil and gas industry polluters accountable for their direct role in causing global warming. And Myrie has led efforts to get our public universities to help put students on paths to the green jobs of the future. Defending Abortion Rights Strongly pro-choice, one of Zellnor Myrie’s first votes in the State Senate was to pass the Reproductive Health Act which ensures abortion rights here in New York . And in the wake of the Supreme Court’s disastrous repeal of Roe v. Wade, Myrie has championed a host of laws to defend abortion access from red-state laws that criminalize abortion, including protecting New York doctors who prescribe abortion pills, like mifepristone, and protecting people who come to New York from other states to obtain abortions. Demanding Better Healthcare Throughout his three terms in the State Senate, Zellnor Myrie has been a powerful voice for expanding access to health care for New Yorkers. He has been an especially forceful advocate for addressing the maternal health crisis in Central Brooklyn and protecting funding for safety net hospitals. This year, he successfully led the fight to stop the closure of SUNY Downstate Medical Center along with a coalition of Brooklyn residents, healthcare workers and labor unions. Moving the Criminal Justice System Forward In the State Senate, Zellnor Myrie has worked to reform the criminal justice system in a way that balances public safety with the need for fundamental fairness . Myrie is the author of the Clean Slate Act, which removes employment barriers for many who’ve paid their debt to society, and he built a coalition of business, law enforcement, and reform advocates to pass it. He’s also authored the Fair Access to Victims Compensation Act to help crime victims get compensation from the state more quickly. And in his first term, Myrie fought to eliminate cash bail for many misdemeanors and non-violent felonies and to pass the Child Victims Act — and later the Adult Victims Act — to allow survivors of sexual abuse to seek justice. Standing Up for Consumers Senator Myrie has fought to keep more money in the pockets of New York’s hard-working families. He wrote the “COVID-19 Fraud Accountability Act,” which sharply increased civil financial penalties for unscrupulous COVID testing scams and other white collar crimes committed in connection with the pandemic or other future emergencies. Senator Myrie also wrote a law to help New York’s aging Holocaust survivors avoid costly bank fees on reparations payments from overseas. And in response to the high cost of prescription drugs, Senator Myrie wrote legislation in 2023 to regulate intermediaries in the pharmaceutical industry that drive up prices for consumers.
