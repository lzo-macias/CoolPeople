New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Access the Legislative API On November 16, 2017, the Council released the NYC Legistar API, allowing the public to directly access our legislative data. What is an API? The Council shares and archives all of our legislative information, including proposed and passed legislation, hearings, and monthly Stated meetings, on our Legislative Research Center, known as Legistar. The New York City Council Legistar system was built by Granicus using their Legistar Legislative Management Suite. The Legistar Web API for New York City is now available for read access by the public. In Council 2.0, the Council’s technology and engagement roadmap, we outlined different ways to increase access and transparency to our legislative information. Making the NYC Legistar API open to the public will allow individuals to create tools and platforms that pull directly from this data source, ensuring increased accuracy and reliability.

The Council shares and archives all of our legislative information, including proposed and passed legislation, hearings, and monthly Stated meetings, on our Legislative Research Center, known as Legistar. The New York City Council Legistar system was built by Granicus using their Legistar Legislative Management Suite. The Legistar Web API for New York City is now available for read access by the public. In Council 2.0, the Council’s technology and engagement roadmap, we outlined different ways to increase access and transparency to our legislative information. Making the NYC Legistar API open to the public will allow individuals to create tools and platforms that pull directly from this data source, ensuring increased accuracy and reliability.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

Summary of Proposal 18 – New “M” Districts (with Council Mods) Highlighted Content: Speaker Adrienne Adams’ Planning & Land Use Guidelines and Toolkit Comprehensive planning must be featured throughout the land use process. Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.  Initiatives Parkchester 2024 Community Engagement Bronx Metro North Area Study (BMNS) Engagement Speaker Adams’ Planning Toolkit and Housing Agenda Gowanus Neighborhood Plan: Racial Equity Report on Housing and Opportunity Morningside Heights Planning Study Inwood Rezoning Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan Planning for Retail Diversity East Harlem Rezoning Greater East Midtown Plan History Until 1989, the Council had no authority over land use issues. The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

🌐 English   🌐 English  Home Meet Sandy Platform How to Vote Donate Co-Governing Our Way Out of Crisis As a community organizer, I have seen and fully believe that building consensus among as many stakeholders as possible is fundamental to being accountable to our communities. Our campaign is dedicated to co-governance.

This inequality is replicated in our school system, and must end by guaranteeing quality education for all. We need to support the next generation of leaders and innovators through providing free higher education to every New Yorker who seeks it. As an activist and organizer, I have been fighting against student debt and the high cost of higher education for years. In the Council, I will continue that fight.

Prisons, torture, and isolation should not be our societal practices. I believe our communities can be safe without having armed officers respond to the majority of crises. Whether it’s Council Members or District Attorneys , all public officials have a responsibility to decarcerate our city. We must divest from the systems that harm us, and invest in the public services and programs that promote healthy communities such as robust family services, drug rehabilitation centers, strong job and workforce development programs, anti-violence programs and experts, and real investments in mental health facilities and services.

I was a leader during the Spring 2020 mass action movement that demanded at least a $1 billion divestment from the NYPD, and for those funds to be reallocated to public programs and services that center care and meet peoples’ immediate needs.

Carranza today announced for  the first time in New York City’s history that all students will have access to  Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and Restorative Justice (RJ) practices and,  when needed, earlier intervention from clinical social workers. The investment  is designed to help school communities be more proactive in changing school  culture and climate. The Department of Education will provide all elementary  schools with access to an SEL curriculum in partnership with National  University System’s Sanford Harmony program. It will also build RJ practices  into all middle and high schools, providing students with the tools they need  to name their emotions, overcome conflicts and repair relationships. “We’ve heard from students, teachers and parents across our  city, and as a result, we’re revolutionizing our school system and giving our  kids the social-emotional tools they need to ensure they develop into healthy  adults,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio . “I’m proud that New York City is  leading the way in our schools, using research-backed methods that encourage  the whole growth of every student.” “To prepare New York City students for the future we must do  more to make sure they are able to learn while they are in the classroom. We  have a responsibility to make sure our young people have the life skills to  navigate their world inside and outside of the classroom and continue  developing into healthy adults,” said First Lady Chirlane McCray . “This  new approach will help us educate the whole child and create a more positive  school climate with greater supports for our educators.” “It's common sense: when we keep students in the classroom  and help them feel safe and supported in their schools, they will succeed,”  said Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza. “We’re doubling  down on an approach that we know works — giving our teachers the  resources to support our students’ social-emotional skills and well-being,  and, as a result, driving down suspensions and improving outcomes. I  thank Mayor de Blasio and First Lady McCray for their leadership, and I'm  excited to get to work on this next step of our children's agenda.” “We  are proud of the joint efforts between the Department of Education and the New  York City Police Department to keep our young people safe in schools,” said Police  Commissioner James P. O’Neill . “This agreement memorializes best practices  that the Police Department and the Department of Education have developed over  the last twenty years. With reductions in both index crime and enforcement  action in New York City schools, the NYPD School Safety Division continues to focus  on supporting students’ success in every school building.” “The  time has come to stop reacting, to stop having to scramble to help students  after the fact,” said Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of  Teachers . “We need a proactive approach, and hopefully today is the start  of getting the right resources to our educators so we can change the school  climate for all students and staff.” “New  York City has set a new standard for empowering youth,” said Patrick J.  Kennedy, former Congressman and Founder of the Kennedy Forum. “Social-Emotional skills are absolutely critical, both to academic success and  overall health and well-being. Rather than relying on discipline to ‘treat the  symptoms’ of poor communication skills, disconnectedness, inability to manage  emotions, and more, these programs prioritize prevention strategies with  long-term impact. It’s exactly what we need, especially as our country  struggles with mental health and addiction crises. My hope is that other cities  will take notice of this exemplary leadership and follow suit.” “For  years, young people have fought to end the school-to-prison pipeline and make  schools more supportive and inclusive,” said Rikya Theresa Kee, Youth Leader  with Urban Youth Collaborative . “Through most of my school experience, I  felt isolated. My schools did not have the resources they needed to support me,  like restorative practices. Today’s announcement to expand restorative justice,  hire more social workers, and propose changing the discipline code gives me  hope that the city is listening to our voices and moving in the right  direction. Now, we must move to fully end racial disparities and the  criminalization of young people in our schools. We still have work to do.” “Through Sanford Harmony, the National University System is  pleased to express our commitment to advancing this collaborative effort in  support of safer schools and student success,” said Dr. Michael R.  Cunningham, Chancellor of the National University System. “Social-emotional  learning helps even the youngest students to develop skills in communication  and collaboration, reducing conflict and fostering positive school climates  that encourage academic achievement. Today’s announcement ensures that all  elementary students in New York City have access to the powerful,  evidence-based program, a vision of philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, to  encourage positive relationships from the classroom to adulthood.” In collaboration with the United Federation of Teachers, 50  middle schools will receive more intensive programming through the Positive  Learning Collaborative model, a restorative approach to changing school  climate. This work will be enhanced, thanks to the New York City Council, with  a new Thrive initiative of 85 borough-based licensed clinical social workers  specifically designed to support teachers and directly help students facing  emotional distress from the point of crisis to a handoff to long-term care, if  necessary. SEL has been proven to improve students’ academic performance  by prioritizing communication, empathy and problem solving. RJ builds on the  SEL continuum by training students to practice their social-emotional learning  skills in everyday life both inside and outside the classroom. The DOE will now  have an SEL continuum in grades Pre-K-12. The DOE also announced its revised Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) between the NYPD and DOE, updates to the NYPD Patrol Guide  that would significantly limit situations where in-school arrests for  out-of-school incidents are allowed, and proposed changes to the DOE discipline  code to keep suspensions below 20 days in most cases except those that involve  serious or violent incidents. The partnership with Sanford Harmony will provide elementary  schools citywide access to an SEL curriculum for the first time. SEL curricula  build on successful existing RJ models in Districts 5, 12, 16 and 18 which  recognize that students don’t simply learn math and English during their  education, but that their time at school shapes how they interact with other  people and themselves. Through intra- and interpersonal relationship lessons  and activities, SEL helps students develop better control of their feelings and  social skills to complement the academic lessons learned in classrooms. Aspects of SEL are already part of the City’s universal Pre-K  programs, where students learn to identify and communicate their emotions and  deal with stress. Now, elementary schools will receive training and materials  relevant for students at every grade level. Lessons and activities include  daily meet-ups for students to engage with each other and a “buddy-up” system  for students to learn how to get along with others. Middle and high schools across the city will reinforce SEL  tenets by implementing Restorative Justice practices. RJ practices de-emphasize  the reliance on solely traditional punitive discipline. Instead, students are  also encouraged to activate SEL skills by focusing on emotion identification,  conflict resolution and problem solving. The use of these skills becomes part  of a school’s daily practice. Students are trained to become leaders in their  own lives and adults are trained in the restorative framework, recognizing that  outside factors often have significant impacts on a student’s day-to-day  response, and those responses must be addressed through multiple approaches. RJ  helps develop the proactive use of SEL to reduce issues of conflict within the  school. Additionally,  50 of the City’s middle schools will take part in Positive Learning  Collaborative (PLC) programming, a restorative approach to school climate  developed in collaboration with the United Federation of Teachers. All 50  schools will receive training in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools  (TCIS) and additional support in an area of need. A smaller cadre of schools  will become partner schools, and in addition to TCIS training will also receive  on-site coaching, support to implement community circles and access to a  behavior specialist who will guide them in the process. The goal is to help  every adult in a PLC school—from teachers to custodians to principals—cultivate  strong relationships with students so school communities can short-circuit many  problems before they start and prevent others from escalating. Several additional noteworthy reforms will be enacted as part  of the new school climate package, including: NYPD-DOE MOU: A new NYPD-DOE Memorandum of       Understanding governs police engagement in schools following a three-year       collaborative process. The MOU clarifies the roles of NYPD and DOE in       addressing school misconduct and stresses their joint commitment to       ensuring that schools are safe havens for our students. NYPD Patrol Guide: The Patrol Guide, given to all       NYPD patrol officers, significantly limits in-school arrests for low-level       offenses and limits allowable circumstances for in-school arrests to       felony crimes, sex offenses, crimes where there is an immediate risk of       escape or where the perpetrator is in hot pursuit, and similar situations.       The guide also reiterates that a principal or similar trusted adult staff       member will serve as the in-school student advocate until a parent or       guardian arrives. Discipline Code: Proposed changes to the DOE       Discipline Code will keep suspensions below 20 days in most cases except       in those that involve serious or violent incidents, including firearm       offenses with a state-mandated suspension length. The change will build on       existing strategies developed by the DOE’s Division of School Climate and       Wellness that have already reduced the average DOE suspension from 21 days       to 13 days. DOE will host community engagement forums in all five boroughs       beginning in July. DOE will also issue for the first time a comprehensive       guide, with training, to ensure that each school has a proper classroom       removal process. 85 Licensed Clinical Social       Workers: Thanks to the New York City Council, a new Thrive initiative comprised of       a unit of 85 licensed clinical social workers will better support students       facing crises across the City and reduce the practice of school staff       calling emergency medical services. The social workers will be able to       provide care in times of immediate emotional distress and help them       receive long-term care if necessary. The Sanford Harmony elementary school program is an  evidence-based, nationally recognized curriculum that builds stronger classroom  communities through relationship-building lessons and activities. The program  will be managed in partnership with National University; to help implement the  program here, a new NYC-based team will work closely with the NYC Department of  Education and Long Island University while drawing on Sanford Harmony’s  national network of trainers and coaches. To date, Sanford Harmony has trained  over 8,000 NYC teachers. Sanford Harmony has committed $5.8 million to this  expansion. Districts that have used Sanford Harmony so far have found  that students display more empathy and develop stronger relationships with  their peers, improving school climate. Explicit SEL enhances student-teacher  communication and improves academic achievement. Additionally, DOE has piloted universal restorative justice  programs in all schools in District 18 (which includes Flatbush and Canarsie)  since School Year 2015-16. The District has seen double-digit decreases in  suspensions during the program. In the first year of the pilot, District 18 saw  a 25 percent decrease in suspensions. Last year, it saw another 11 percent  decrease. The racial disparity in suspensions  has also fallen in the district compared to the citywide ratio. Citywide,  black students are 2.6 times as likely to be suspended compared to their peers,  but in District 18, they are only 1.2 times as likely. Replicating the model  used in District 18 presents an opportunity to respond to similar challenges  with both locally and nationally evidence-based practices. The entire school climate package will roll out over three  years, with schools citywide divided into three cohorts and receiving services  on a rolling basis. “As  our City has shown time and again, government is capable of advancing big ideas  – swiftly and at scale – but the public sector can’t do it all, and we can’t do  it alone, which makes partnerships like the one with Sanford Harmony so  important and powerful,” said Darren Bloch, Senior Advisor to the Mayor and  Director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships . “Thanks to the support of  T. Denny Sanford, National University and Long Island University, all  elementary students will now have access to a profound set of tools to help  them strive and thrive in school and beyond.” “Restorative justice processes are a powerful method to  improve student relationships and ultimately reduce the likelihood of serious  conflicts,” said Director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice  Elizabeth Glazer . “MOCJ will continue to support innovative school models  and look forward to working with our agency partners and education stakeholders  to generate additional solutions to make our schools more just and safe places  for all.” “All of our students need to know they are not alone and  there are people who can help them,” Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A.  Rosa .  “I applaud Chancellor Carranza’s commitment to promoting a  positive school climate and learning, which enhance the whole child, the whole  school and the whole community. Social Emotional Learning is key to our efforts  to foster equity under the state’s ESSA plan, as it goes hand in hand with the  work being done in schools every day to better academic performance, improve  school climate and reduce exclusionary discipline.” “The quality of school climate is one of the most predictive  factors in promoting school achievement,” said State Education Commissioner  Mary Ellen Elia . “Chancellor Carranza’s renewed focus on these critically  important school climate elements mirrors our efforts across the state to  promote positive school climate, which has been shown to result in a lower  incidence of student absenteeism, suspensions and substance abuse. New York  stands with New York City in its focus on ensuring that schools are safe havens  for students and their teachers, where they are free to teach and to  continually grow together.” “New  York City students deserve to be empowered so they can thrive in our schools.  Through this program, Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice  practices are transforming students’ lives and helping them find success, as  we’ve seen with students in my District. I am glad to see NYC is expanding this  program to embolden more school kids throughout the city,” said Congresswoman  Yvette D. Clarke . “As  a former classroom teacher, I understand how critical it is to invest in the  social and emotional aspects of a child’s education. That’s why I commend the  Mayor for expanding New York City’s education system to include these new  classes. Accounting for the mental health of students provides them with the  ability to achieve both inside and outside the classroom. In addition, the  Mayor’s plan to reform the Department of Education disciplinary code is an  important step in the right direction. Schools are for teaching and learning,  not arresting students to further the school to prison pipeline. I am pleased  the city has recognized these realities and offered a proposal to better our  public schools,” said Congressman Eliot Engel. “I  am very excited that New York City will be bringing social-emotional wellness  and restorative justice practices to the fore of our children's education,”  said State Senator Robert Jackson. “Research backs up the benefits of  these approaches, especially among working-class communities of color where  students have for too long been over-disciplined by suspensions and  criminalized in ways that perpetuate cycles of oppression. I look forward to  seeing these programs expand to cover all children in New York City in the  coming years. This is an important step in the direction of a brighter  educational future for our young people.” "For  too long, our schools have over-relied on punishment and under-invested in  social support,” said State Senator Zellnor Y. Myrie . “As a result,  black and brown students are too often funneled into the school-to-prison  pipeline for incidents that could have been addressed with counselors rather  than cops. The expansion of SEL and Restorative Justice in our schools is a  step toward recognizing the dignity and potential of every single student;  expanding their future rather than trapping them in their past. I am encouraged  by this effort and look forward to building on this momentum." “As  the sponsor of state legislation on this important topic, I applaud the Mayor  and Chancellor's efforts to make schools safe and welcoming environments for  all of our students,” said Assembly Member Cathy Nolan . “Schools must be  places where students feel comfortable and can learn properly, and I look  forward to working with our schools, students and families on this important  issue at both the city and state level.” “For  too long, black and brown children have been made to feel like second class  citizens in their own schools and classrooms. Children cannot learn in  environments where they do not feel safe and respected” said Assembly Member  Diana Richardson . “I commend the Mayor and Chancellor for taking this  important step forward. I look forward to working with them to ensure this is  just the start to changing a school discipline system that has not treated our  children fairly.” “Reforming the NYC school discipline process is a subject of  extreme importance to me as Black girls in NYC are nine times as likely to be  suspended in comparison to their white counterparts,” said Assembly Member Latrice  Walker. “This mayoral initiative continues a conversation my colleagues and  I in Albany have had about addressing children and understanding the  social-emotional learning challenges many of our inner-city school children  face. This is a good first step and I look forward to working with the city to  implement further restorative practices and continue the push at the statewide  level.” “Today  the Mayor and City Council showed that they agree with my assessment that the  mental health of New York City students is a priority by passing a budget that  included $30 million for 285 social workers for New York City students,” said Manhattan  Borough President Gale A. Brewer . “It’s a great first step toward my goal  of at least one full-time social worker in every school. School-based social  workers make a huge impact, and I’ll continue to work to ensure direct access  to mental health care for New York’s students.” “Social  and emotional learning is an important way to ensure we are taking a  whole-child approach to education. Children cannot perform well in school if  they’re dealing with trauma and conflict in their lives. That’s why I have been  proud to support mindfulness as a start to the school day for students, joining  with Chancellor Carranza and Council Member Espinal earlier this year to  announce the Yoga and Mindfulness Teacher Preparation Program. I have also been  proud to facilitate groundbreaking participatory budgeting projects at two high  school campuses in Brooklyn this year that work off of the concept of  encouraging restorative justice practices. These steps will make a positive  difference in the lives of our children, and I applaud the Mayor and the First  Lady for their steadfast advocacy,” said Brooklyn Borough President Eric L.  Adams . “Students  need more social and emotional supports, not punitive disciplinary measures –  and I’ve been proud to join with advocates, especially our powerful youth  voices, to make sure the welfare of our students is the city’s top priority.  The new school climate MOU is a positive step forward to implement social and  emotional supports, which includes providing crucial Restorative Justice  training that will offer vital mechanisms for conflict resolution and  increasing the number of licensed clinical social workers available to  students. It’s also very important that this MOU will limit NYPD activity in  schools so that there will not be arrests in schools for low-level offenses. In  addition, the number of days allowed for suspensions will be limited, which  helps ensure our students do not have long disruptions to their education,”  said Council Member Mark Treyger, Chair of the Committee on Education .  “I commend Mayor de Blasio and Chancellor Carranza for their efforts to  implement the MOU and institute more social and emotional supports throughout  our school system, and I’m so proud of our students for advocating for these  important and necessary changes.” “Throughout  the last school year, students across the city have sent the clear message to  City Hall and the City Council that more counseling and services are what they  need to feel safer in schools, not more law enforcement,” said Council  Member Donovan Richards, Chair of the Committee on Public Safety .  “Thankfully, today’s announcement shows that those voices did not fall on deaf  ears as the Department of Education is now dedicating their efforts on  social-emotional learning and restorative justice as opposed to punitive  justice. Students should never be taken out of a classroom in handcuffs or for  extended periods of time as a form of punishment as those actions are  prohibitive to solving each student’s problems. I’m proud to work for a City  Council that has funded hundreds of social workers to get at the root of  individual student issues and am thankful that Mayor de Blasio, Chancellor  Carranza and Commissioner O’Neill have come to an agreement on the best path  forward for our youth who deal with so many issues at home, in schools and in  their community.” “Black  and Latinx students have been disproportionately impacted by policing in our  schools. This agreement will help reduce the interactions between police and  students, while leading to profound investments in Social-Emotional Learning  and Restorative Justice practices,” said Council Member Diana Ayala, Chair  of the City Council’s Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addiction .  “I thank Mayor de Blasio, Chancellor Carranza, and First Lady McCray for  pursuing these efforts, which will ensure our students can learn in safe,  supportive spaces.” “These  newly adopted Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice practices will  move our public schools forward by leaps and bounds,” said Council Member  Daniel Dromm . “Our schools must be safe, nurturing places for all students,  and this effort brings us closer toward achieving that goal. I am pleased that  the administration is embracing this progressive approach to school discipline  and learning, something for which my colleagues and I have long advocated. As  someone who taught in a NYC public school for over two decades, I thank the  Mayor, the First Lady and the Chancellor for prioritizing this important  effort.” “Students, parents, and elected officials have fought long  and hard to break the school to prison pipeline in New York City,” said Council  Member Antonio Reynoso . “A safe learning environment that is sensitive to  cultural and emotional needs is the foundation to keeping our kids in  classrooms where they belong and not behind bars. I thank Mayor de Blasio and  Chancellor Carranza for their newly announced investment in social-emotional  learning supports, an expanded restorative justice curriculum, and changes to  suspension protocol. Let’s continue to listen to our youth and provide what  they need to thrive.” Council  Member Alicka Ampry Samuel said, “This is one of the reasons why I love being a  New Yorker.  Today’s announcement of program initiatives directed towards  Social Emotional Learning will be a game changer for our school systems.  Education isn’t only about academics, this addresses the whole child.  I’m  glad NYC is leading the way to address the many needs of our youth in order to  provide the support they need to succeed in school and in life.” “This  newly announced school climate package contains demands that students, parents,  and educators have been organizing around for years,” said Kate McDonough,  Director of Dignity in Schools Campaign-NY . “It is a big step forward in  creating the schools that young people deserve.” “Instituting  Restorative Justice, increasing social emotional supports, and dismantling  punitive discipline in New York City's schools are critical and necessary steps  forward in both addressing systemic racism and ensuring justice for our youth”,  said Jennifer Jones, CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies .  “Today’s announcement evidences a sincere commitment to improving educational  and life outcomes for our students, especially those who’ve been  disproportionately impacted by disparate practices in the past.” “Today,  the Mayor, First Lady, and Chancellor have shown that they are accountable to  schools, parents, and students by making system level change that focuses on  building stronger students through increased mental health supports and  restorative justice to our schools. These changes bring our school communities  and city leadership closer to Justice and Equality,” said Dr. Hazel N.  Dukes, President of the NAACP New York State Conference . “We  applaud the Mayor, First Lady, and the Chancellor for not shying away from  their responsibility to our city’s future and addressing the social and  emotional needs of our youth across all of our New York City schools,” said Frankie  Miranda, Executive Vice President of Hispanic Federation . “For too long we  have watched policies centered on punitive measures derail the academic futures  of students and, in some instances, contribute to a school to prison pipeline.  Today’s announcement provides the opportunity to address the real and unique  challenges that our youth, especially our Latino and black students, are facing  in an increasingly challenging societal and political climate. Through  increased access to counselors and social workers, and less reliance on law  enforcement and detention, the city will be doing more to ensure a safe and  productive school environment that will keep students on track to graduation  and postsecondary success.” “Today’s  announcement by the mayor on the expansion of support for socioemotional learning/education,  the scaling and capacity building for restorative practices, and the overhaul  of how police operate in schools is game-changing,” said David Kirkland of  the NYU Metro Center. “Scholars, youth organizers, and civil rights  advocates have long pressed for the implementation of a critical sequence of  reforms that value and affirm the humanity of our students. The mayor’s  announcement is a win not only for those who have demanded more school  counselors, less in-school arrests, and greater attention to the non-cognitive  aspects of education, but also for a city positioned to lead the country in our  collective effort to advance equity and justice in education. This is a clear  statement in a long and continuing conversation about how education both requires  dignity and those of us who do education work to grapple with hard questions  about how to make schools work outside the peculiar and insidious impulse to  exclude, criminalize, vilify, and pass blame. Of course, there remains  significant work ahead of us; however, because of today’s announcement, we are  in a better position to move this work and this conversation forward.” “The  DOE's new initiative to reduce suspensions through efforts to promote Social  and Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice is sensible and long overdue,”  said Pedro A. Noguera, PhD, Faculty Director for the Center for the  Transformation of Schools at the UCLA Graduate School of Education &  Information Studies . “Schools can be safe and orderly without excluding  students who misbehave from learning opportunities. By addressing the cause of  behavior problems and improving the culture and climate of schools, suspensions  can be used as a last resort rather than the primary discipline strategy. If  implemented well the DOE strategy will help schools to create an environment  where teaching and learning can flourish while simultaneously increasing  support to our most vulnerable students.” “Police  presence in schools and a zero-tolerance disciplinary approach make students  feel like criminals in their own classrooms,” said Johanna Miller, Director  of the Education Policy Center at NYCLU . “Today’s announcement is  about treating kids like kids, allowing them to recover from mistakes, and  teaching them the tools to manage emotions and behavior. By adopting these  recommendations from the Leadership Team, the City is taking real a step  toward ending the School to Prison Pipeline.” “The  Children’s Defense Fund – New York commends the Mayor and Chancellor for taking  tremendous steps to advance education justice,” said Naomi Post, Executive  Director of the Children’s Defense Fund – New York . “Strengthening access  to restorative practices and social-emotional learning, clarifying the role of  police in schools, and proposing real changes to the Discipline Code will move  us much closer to addressing pervasive discipline disparities. We are  optimistic that these initiatives will promote the conditions necessary to  sustain positive school climates and transform learning throughout the city.” “I am gratified that my peers and I will have someone to talk to rather than  someone to talk at us. Progress is being made to support all students, but  specifically Black and Latinx students who have been disproportionately  penalized in schools,” said Marcus Altson, a Junior at Pace High School and  a member of Teens Take Charge and Organizing For Equity NY .  “Social-Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice practices are an important  step to ending the school to prison pipeline. However, there is still work to  do to ensure that schools are places where all students feel supported and  safe.” “Students  belong in their classrooms, with their teachers and peers,” said Ben  West-Weyner, Co-Coordinator, Organizing For Equity NY . “This citywide move  toward Restorative Justice and away from exclusion will support educators in  fostering the loving school communities that our children deserve.” “It  is exciting that our community children and youth will be engaged academically  and emotionally,” said Pia J. Raymond, CEO of Creating Legacies . “I am  confident that the holistic approach to education, including the significant  addition of licensed social workers to our schools and modified implementation  of school safety procedure with the NYPD is invaluable in building dynamic,  self-aware and astute young leaders. I applaud Mayor Bill de Blasio, First Lady  Chirlane McCray and Chancellor Richard A. Carranza for their Social-Emotional  Learning and Restorative Justice initiative to empower students, teachers,  faculty and families across New York City.” “CCC applauds Mayor de Blasio for making these critical  commitments to NYC’s students,” said Jennifer March, Executive Director of  Citizens’ Committee for Children. “The multi-pronged strategies announced  today will go a long way toward combatting the school-to-prison pipeline and  keeping more students safe and in school. CCC supports efforts to invest in  Social-Emotional curricula and Restorative Justice practices as well those  aimed at reducing suspensions and arrests in schools. Together, these actions  will help students feel safe, welcomed, and supported in schools. CCC welcomes  the opportunity to work with the Department of Education to implement and  expand upon these important proposals.” “With most mental illnesses beginning during childhood, it is  essential that we offer children and schools the tools they need to move all  children toward greater mental health and, for those who need them, pathways to  recovery instead of incarceration,” said Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO,  Mental Health America . “This is a visionary plan that will make a huge  difference, and can serve as an example to other communities and public  officials.” “We  have had a long and valued relationship with New York City beginning with First  Lady Chirlane McCray’s commitment to  Mental Health First Aid training. With these actions, they are once  again proving themselves to be leaders by paving the way for children to access  better education, health and long-term success,” said Chuck Ingoglia,  president and CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health. “Research  shows Social-Emotional Learning plays a critical role in promoting student  success by increasing the likelihood of continued education, better mental  health, healthy relationships and reduced criminal behavior.” About  National University and Sanford Harmony The  private, nonprofit National University System was established to meet the  emerging challenges and demands of education in the 21st century.

TeachHub Employees Submit Home Learning Programs Community Schools NYC Community Schools Beginning in fall 2014, 45 schools became NYC Community Schools as part of an attendance-improvement and drop-out-prevention grant in partnership with United Way NYC. In School Year 2022-23 there are 421 Community Schools across every district in NYC, funded through city, state and federal dollars. Community Schools support: the whole child the child’s family learning both inside and outside of the classroom Community School Success Read about our results in a new report from the RAND Corporation which proves that NYC Community Schools are effective in increasing graduation rates and student achievement, and in reducing chronic absenteeism and disciplinary incidents. What Happens in a Community School? The more time students spend at school, the more they learn. And so Community Schools stay open after school and over the summer. During that time they may offer: Arts Sports Music lessons Book clubs Robotics Healthy students attend more days of school. That’s why school-based health services include: Vision care/free glasses Medical care Dental care Mental health counselors When students feel supported and welcome, they thrive in school. That’s why community schools have more adults who can: Mentor Tutor Make connections with parents and families When students see learning as a life-long skill, they stick with it more. That’s why we offer parents and families: Adult education classes Training for parents leaders Access to social services Adult education programs and social services provide parents and caregivers with skills and resources to improve their lives. Each school has a lead Community-Based Organization (CBO) partner that coordinates and delivers services. Every school also has a Community School Director, who is a CBO employee. Ways to Get Involved Parents Attend your schools Parent Association/Parent Teacher Association Meeting(s) or run for a position. Meet with your Parent Coordinator to discuss upcoming opportunities to get involved, like parent workshops or your Community School Forum in the spring. Contact the Parent Empowerment Liaison for your district about upcoming parent leadership development opportunities.

Worker cooperatives are businesses that are owned and controlled by their workers (worker-owners). Worker cooperatives give New Yorkers the opportunity to co-own a business, creating sustainable and dignified jobs while developing community wealth. This helps people who lack access to traditional business ownership. For general information about worker cooperatives or WCBDI, please fill out our interest form . Get help with one or more of the following: Transition an Existing Business To a Worker Cooperative Our network of expert service providers have a proven track record of helping NYC business owners stabilize businesses, complete business sales to employees, and achieve growth.
