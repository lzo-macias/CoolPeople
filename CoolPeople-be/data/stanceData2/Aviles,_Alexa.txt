New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate Legislation New York City is diverse, complex, and unlike anywhere else. The Council creates laws to provide a framework for governing our unique city. The Council writes and passes local laws that affect the day-to-day lives of people living in, working in, or visiting New York City. Local laws can impact the lives of New Yorkers in many ways, both large and small. Some examples include: Paid Sick Leave, which enabled New Yorkers who are part-time workers at companies with 5+ employees to take paid time off when they’re ill IDNYC, which created a municipal photo identification program that allows New Yorkers who prove their residence to access city-based services and benefits See legislation The Council can also pass resolutions on state and federal issues that are relevant to New Yorkers. Resolutions allow the Council to express a collective voice of the City, and can play an important role in the development of law and public policy throughout New York State and across the nation. One type of resolution is a State Legislation Resolution (SLR), where the Council makes an official request of the New York State Legislature (also known as a “Home Rule Message”) to pass a special law affecting New York City. Council Members & Committees Council Members are assigned to Committees that examine specific topic areas. These Committees consist of a minimum of five Council Members and are tasked to study the potential impact of local laws and public policies. They then make recommendations for the entire 51-member body to consider and vote upon at Stated Meetings. By studying specific issues, Council Committees ensure that differing community needs are acknowledged. Learn more about Committees Legislative Division Each Council Committee also has a team of staff attorneys and analysts. This team supports the Committee by arranging public hearings and providing the legal and policy-based research needed to make decisions that benefit New York City. Notice for the public (January 14, 2025) Notice for the public (January 23, 2025) The Legislative Process Step 1: Bill introduction Council Members work with the Legislation Division to craft a bill that is introduced at stated meetings, where it is assigned to the appropriate Committee. Step 2: Public hearings The Committee will hold a public hearing on a bill to obtain feedback from the public and other government entities who may be affected by the bill. This may result in amendments to the bill. Step 3: Voting The Committee votes on the bill. If the bill passes the Committee by majority vote, the bill is then sent to the full Council where it will be considered and voted on at a Stated Meeting. The bill must again pass by majority vote. Step 4: Mayoral decision After a bill is passed by the Council, it is presented to the Mayor, who has 30 days to either sign the bill into law, veto the bill or take no action. If the Mayor vetoes the bill, it is sent back to the Council. If this happens, the Council can override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote. If the Mayor doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 30 days, it becomes law. Step 5: Bill becomes law Once a bill is signed by the Mayor (or its veto has been overridden by Council), it’s then added to the New York City Charter or Administrative Code. The Legislative Division often refers to its Bill Drafting Manual , one of the first local-level drafting manuals in the country to be written and made available to the public. We put together this manual primarily to assist the Council’s Legislative Division in drafting bills and resolutions. We are making it available to the public to further the Council’s interests in transparency and public education.

New York City Council Search for:   Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate What we do Together, we… Introduce and vote on legislation (proposed laws) having to do with all aspects of City life. Negotiate the City’s budget with the Mayor and approve its adoption. Monitor City agencies such as the Department of Education and the NYPD to make sure they’re effectively serving New Yorkers. Review land use and make decisions about the growth and development of our city. Similar to Congress at the federal level, we are New York City’s legislative body. The Council is separate from the Mayor’s administration but an equal partner in how our City is run. So, for example, while the Mayor has the option of vetoing legislation that we have approved, the Council can respond with a two-thirds or more vote enacting a law over the objection of the Mayor to turn a bill into a law. The Council negotiates to ensure that certain services are included in the City’s budget. Leadership The Speaker The Speaker is elected by Council Members and leads us in setting priorities, passing laws, and directing public money for the benefit of New Yorkers. Currently, Speaker Adrienne Adams heads the Council. The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Deputy Speaker Council Member Diana Ayala The Majority Leader Council Member Amanda Farías The Majority Whip Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers The Minority Leader The Minority Whip Council Member Inna Vernikov How we work Hearings Most of our legislative work happens in committee meetings and hearings focused on human services, infrastructure, and government affairs. These committees discuss proposed laws, receive updates from agency representatives, and hear feedback from New Yorkers like you. Committees Each committee is chaired by a Council Member and meets at least once every other month, except in July and August. Every Council Member is assigned — through a voting process by all Council Members to – serve on various committees and subcommittees, a committee that considers specific matters and reports back to the standing committee. Caucuses The Council also meets in caucuses, a group of Members with shared concerns, to ensure that the needs of specific communities are represented. There are currently seven caucuses: Black, Latino and Asian (BLA) Caucus; Common-Sense Caucus; Irish Caucus; Jewish Caucus; LGBTQ Caucus; Progressive Caucus; and Women’s Caucus. Want to know more? Check out the complete rules of the Council here . (updated 1/18/2024) via BRIC TV Where we meet, vote, and listen Members have offices in each of their districts, and also a legislative office at 250 Broadway. We discuss issues in the Council side of City Hall and hold Stated Meetings, meetings held twice every month, and at Council Members’ discretion during July and August, in the Council Chambers to vote on legislation. Hearings are generally held at City Hall or 250 Broadway. And we spend a great deal of time in each of our districts, ensuring your needs are being met and your voice is being heard.

Speaker Adams’ Planning and Land Use Toolkit provide Council Members, local communities, city agencies, and developers with a framework for improving the land use process to balance local community priorities with citywide needs. A pathway to increase housing production, affordability and equity is needed for our city. Housing Agenda to Confront the City’s Crisis New York City is growing, with its population and jobs far outpacing available homes and housing production. Rents are at historic highs and competition for housing is only increasing. If the city’s housing shortage remains unaddressed, New Yorkers will continue to be pushed out and homelessness will grow. We need to develop more affordable housing, senior housing, homeownership, and supportive housing, as well as market rate housing. Simultaneously, more efforts are needed to protect existing affordable housing and homeownership, and to ensure every New Yorker’s home is healthy and safe. Community Engagement Click on a link below to learn more about community engagement efforts that the City Council Planning and Land Use Division is currently supporting. Parkchester Community Engagement Session Land Use Committee The Council’s Land Use Committee has jurisdiction over all the types of actions listed above. The committee also has two subcommittees, each with its own Chair, that take care of specific sets of issues: Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions A rezoning, for instance, would be handled by the Zoning and Franchises subcommittee, while the designation of a landmark would be handled by the Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions subcommittee. Links to Legistar: Committee on Land Use Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Dispositions The Planning & Land Use Division The Council has a dedicated team of city planners, attorneys, and administrative staff that support Council Members and the Land Use Committee. This division helps the committee Chairs conduct hearings and analyze land use issues on behalf of Council Members. The Division was formerly known as the Land Use Division. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams changed the name to the Planning & Land Use Division because planning must be at the forefront of the land use process. Planning means understanding the conditions and challenges facing our city and its neighborhoods, identifying shared goals and principles, and applying the policies to address and achieve them. Planning means being intentional about our future and making sure that our decisions collectively align with these goals. And last but not least planning requires meaningful and deep engagement of communities in this work. Before applications for land use changes begin public review and eventually reach the Council, there should be a planning process that involves understanding the conditions of the affected area and engaging stakeholders including Administration agencies and community members including residents and elected officials. Zoning Zoning controls what property owners can do with their land (such as build apartments or a factory) as well as how large buildings can be. When the Mayor or a developer wants to change the zoning, they must go through a public review process involving hearings at the Community Board, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission, and City Council. The Council has the final say in whether the zoning is changed. Landmarks The Landmarks Preservation Commission designates landmarks and historic districts. The Council can approve, modify, or disapprove the Commission’s decision. Once a building is “landmarked,” the owner must apply for permission to alter the façade, to build additions, or to demolish the building City Land & Public Facilities The City often buys, sells, or leases real estate for a specific purpose, such as building a new school, renting an office for an agency, or buying land upstate to protect the City’s water supply. Or the City might sell land to a business so they can expand and employ more people. Or the City might give land to a developer building affordable housing, often with tax exemptions that make the apartments even more affordable. When the City buys or sells land, or gives a tax exemption, the Council can approve or disapprove these actions. The Land Use Process at the Council Stage of ULURP Step 1: Submission of Application to Council Whenever any of the above actions takes place, the Council receives an application explaining the project. Council Members and staff then analyze the application and its potential consequences for the city as a whole, as well as for the local community. Step 2: Council Hearing When the Council receives a land use application, it’s referred to the appropriate subcommittee, which then holds a public hearing and votes on the application. Step 3: Land Use Committee After the subcommittee has heard and voted on the application, the Land Use Committee meets and votes on the application. Step 4: Council Vote The City Council will then hold a meeting with all 51 members and will vote on the application as a body. Step 5: Mayoral Approval or Veto The Mayor may either accept or veto the Council’s decision. However, the Council may override the Mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote.

The Board of Estimate had controlled land use issues throughout the five boroughs. However, in the 1980s, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional. And in 1989, the Council was given its land use powers and created the Land Use Committee and the Land Use Division. Mayoral Agencies The City Council controls one specific part of the land use process, but Mayoral agencies handle many other aspects. The Department of City Planning is responsible for zoning, for instance, while the Landmarks Preservation Commission handles landmarks and historic districts.

Alexa believes a better world is possible, and that together, we can build a City that works for the many, not just the wealthy and powerful few . Our campaign’s vision for justice aims to continue the work of her first two terms in office, rooted in the humanity, dignity, and solidarity of the working class. Our community is resilient, and we’ve helped one another weather difficult times before. We understand that there are no quick fixes to our problems, but when we work together, we can build the kind of city we deserve. Our platform is evolving. Through conversations with community members, we are learning what your priorities are, because Alexa will always fight for working people in District 38. Quality & Equitable Education for All As a former public-school student and the mother of two public school students, Alexa has witnessed the inequities and injustices of NYC’s school system firsthand. Elected leaders at every level of government must recognize that fully funding our public schools and ensuring culturally appropriate and positive school environments are essential to the future of our city and our country. NYC public schools continue to be understaffed and lack the appropriate level of resources to ensure every student succeeds. During her tenure Alexa has centered the importance of funding and appropriate staffing for our diverse and differently abled children. She has strenuously advocated against mayoral funding cuts to both K-12 public education and CUNY and invested millions of dollars in facility improvements, equipment and programming for local schools across the district. She successfully advocated for NYC DOE to stop problematic regulations that would have rolled back student data privacy protections and successfully advocated a $3M investment in the creation of a Latino studies curriculum for K-12 schools. She remains committed to advocating for appropriate levels of funding and services for children with special needs, especially for ENL students who face additional barriers. She will continue to work with her local schools, PTAs, students and advocates to fight for fully funded public schools. Lastly, Alexa is a staunch supporter of universal childcare and will continue to fight to obtain free, quality, accessible care for all New Yorkers. Read our full education platform Safe, affordable and dignified housing New York City’s luxury real estate market is world-famous, but we’re building more and more towers for the ultra-rich while New Yorkers are experiencing record rates of homelessness. This is not a coincidence. For decades, the city’s housing market has been rigged, with politicians underfunding public housing and allowing private developers to sweep in and build a city for the rich. We must take on the developers, give the people control of their land, and fully fund public housing to build a city where every last New Yorker can have a safe, quality, and dignified home. Read More Demand a renter and small homeowner recovery plan and funding package. As we recover from the ravages of COVID, we must prioritize helping everyone maintain their home. Relief money must go to those who are at risk, not to the developers who hope to use this as an opportunity to force more working people out of their homes. Expand Right to Counsel to cover all renters citywide. Currently, many tenants fighting eviction are eligible for free legal representation. We must grant this right to everyone, because the city should be working to keep every New Yorker in their home, not evict them. Push for a National Homes Guarantee, in coordination with elected leaders in our federal government. As a representative from our nation’s most populous city, Alexa will join Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and others in calling on the federal government to deliver a massive expansion in federal funding for public housing and the creation of new social housing. The Guarantee also demands reparations to redress explicitly a national history of racist dispossession, exclusion, and exploitation of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people. District 38 must free itself from the exploitation of wealthy real estate developers. Currently, we are at the mercy of private developers and the City’s piecemeal planning approach. We must break the cycle of big-money, developer-led; reactive, unresourced, and slapdash development in our District. It's time for our community to take control of our future with forward-looking alternative models for land use that prioritize communities, not private real estate interests. We’re working to roll out a comprehensive platform, in coordination with voters in the district — renters, small homeowners, and working people struggling to get by. Have an idea or community concern? Email us at info@alexaforcouncil.com . A people’s budget In FY 25, New York City’s budget was $112.43 billion, bigger than some countries and many states across the US. Tucked in the opaque document, are thousands of funding commitments from the most mundane but necessary city services to bloated questionable contracts for private corporations. During Alexa’s tenure, she witnessed firsthand a mayoral administration cutting city services more than five times while sitting on extraordinary surpluses. She fought against austerity budgets and decimation of the city workforce we depend on for core services.  Alexa voted NO to a budget that defunded every critical city service while offering unlimited overtime to police budgets and handouts to private industries. True safety is a result of fully funding what communities need to thrive which include investing in public infrastructure, education, healthcare, parks and green space, housing, transportation and arts and culture.  Alexa is fighting for a People’s Budget that is transparent and prioritizes the health and wellness of working people over ensuring corporate profit and maintaining the comfort of the 1%.  Public dollars must be used for the public good and to strengthen public institutions. Immigrant justice District 38 is a community of immigrants — those who recently made our neighborhood home, and those who have been here for decades. All of them face ongoing discrimination and significant barriers to services and support. We must fight to strengthen protections for our beloved immigrant residents and advocate for deeper investments in service and support programs , like legal representation, immigration integration centers, and language access. We must also fight for municipal voting for resident immigrants, giving them the voice in government that they deserve as members of our community. Together, we can dismantle the structures that keep our immigrant neighbors living in fear. We can transform our city into one where everyone can thrive. Healthcare for all New Yorkers have a right to quality healthcare, and a right to live free from pollution and other environmental hazards. But District 38 residents have not been afforded that right. Instead, our neighbors have some of the highest rates of being uninsured, coupled with limited access to public hospitals . This duality of inaccessibility is by design. And it’s why Alexa will fight for funding our public hospitals and expanding NYC Care. The Council must fight for increased funding to strengthen the capacity of community-based organizations that work on health and resiliency directly with residents. Alexa will advocate for the institution of a resident-led Community Health Advisory Table that can map, guide, and vision a proactive set of new policies that serve our residents’ needs — not the for-profit, private health industry’s bottom line. Additionally, Alexa will demand the passage of the New York Health Act at the state level. This act will create a single-payer system for New York State, providing quality healthcare for all. Environmental Justice & Climate Change Most of our District has been carved up by a highway system and the siting of a disproportionate amount of polluting infrastructure because of environmental racism. Alexa believes the community must lead in the creation and implementation of solutions to mitigate and address the myriads of environmental justice & climate issues facing the district. De-carbonizing our city is critical for our long-term survival.  Locally, she has been fighting to address the negative health and community impacts of last-mile facilities, cruise terminal, Industrial/manufacturing sector, peaker plants and heavy truck and car traffic. During her time in office, she has been committed to mitigation and finding sustainable solutions to these challenges. Alexa passed legislation to update its truck routes which hadn’t been touched in over 30 years; fight air pollution with several anti-idling policies, along with passage of Our Air, Our Water mandating the electrification of NYC’s cruise ports. She successfully advocated for the development of a special permit for siting of last-mile facilities and strengthened our industrial manufacturing zones that call for healthier green initiatives to expand economic opportunity. She will continue her zealous advocacy for clean air through calling for the decommissioning the local Peaker Plant, passing the zero-emissions port study, implementing a study for the development of a local indirect source rule, protecting local law 97, expanding community-solar; and advancing the green re-industrialization of our working waterfront that includes expanding green union jobs.  Passed in 2023, Alexa is committed to the full implementation of the Build Public Renewables Act.  She will also continue to work with the NYC Department of Sanitation on the persistent illegal dumping across the district and called for improved sanitation services. Read our full environmental justice platform Arts and culture To create a city where the arts can flourish, the City Council needs to plan for more than just COVID-19 recovery. While the pandemic has drastically impacted the livelihoods of arts and culture workers, artists have endured deep-rooted systemic obstacles for too long. We have to build a city that truly supports arts and culture workers and their families. Artists and musicians are workers, and their work contributes to thriving communities, just like ours. In District 38 and beyond, Alexa will fight to invest in making the arts accessible and sustainable for all. Make D38 an Arts Haven for its Residents Rectify decades-long cuts to NYCHA’s community centers, and co-create arts programing with Red Hook Houses residents. Offer Open Culture permits permanently, prioritizing performances in parks serving low income communities. Work with artists to establish a wage floor to pay performers, and split the cost. Safety, Not Cops Abolish the surprise late-night raids of community arts spaces by dismantling the Multi-Agency Response to Community Hotspots (MARCH) task force. Invest in free safety resources and education for venues to help community spaces stay up-to-code. Invest in Independent Artists Fund work programs for artists, like those established by the Works Progress Administration. Extend the recent City Artist Corps program and establish benchmarks to ensure funding increases over time. Streamline the application process for artists to obtain Department of Cultural Affairs, Borough Councils of the Arts, or discretionary funding. Establish a quota of Department of Cultural Affairs advisory board seats reserved for independent artists.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Environmental justice: Our vision for a sustainable and resilient district Every New Yorker deserves the ability to move, to live, to thrive. Alexa is running for City Council to protect these basic, necessary human rights and freedoms. If you’ve spent even a moment in District 38, you know that it is lively and bustling — with awe-inspiring vistas, a park that overlooks our beautiful city, and good neighbors, who interact with our city’s streets, buildings, trees and waterfront every day as they work, raise families and take care of one another. Alexa will preserve our district’s vibrancy by fighting for environmental justice that includes good, clean jobs — so that every District 38 resident can count on reliable public transportation, dignified and sustainable housing, clean air to breathe, and community ownership of our land and resources. Climate change is hitting frontline communities like ours hard and fast. The Red Hook Houses, the largest public housing complex in Brooklyn, have never recovered from Superstorm Sandy nor preceding decades of divestment. NYCHA has been unable to address appalling conditions, at times leaving residents stuck with toxic mold, no heat, no water and no means to cook. And all of us suffer from poor air quality, whether from traffic along the Gowanus Expressway or from cruise ships idling at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. Environmental racism is not a coincidence — it is a product of a capitalist system that puts profit before people and sells out our fresh air, water and health to private interests. As District 38’s next City Councilmember, Alexa will prioritize community-driven land use with a vision for resiliency and good, green jobs, in partnership with the District’s long-standing neighborhood leaders. Industry City’s vision for the Sunset Park waterfront was wrong for the working-class people of our district. We need a community plan that ushers in a just transition for workers and the planet. Residents of our district walk or take public transit more than the average New Yorker, and more of them work in local retail corridors and in manufacturing and light industrial firms along the waterfront. Workers in sectors servicing the building trades, like those along the waterfront, are more likely to earn higher wages and have union benefits, and we must prioritize creating good jobs like these for workers without a college degree. As major companies explore investments along the Sunset Park and Red Hook waterfront, and the City’s landmark energy efficiency law draws new investment in existing construction and light manufacturing firms, we must compel firms, the City and the State to respect their workers and judge new development based on whether or not it delivers racial, environmental and economic justice, maximizing community leverage in a citywide land use process. According to the Climate Justice Alliance, whose work informs this platform, “Just Transition must be liberatory and transformative. The impacts of the extractive economy knows no borders. We recognize the interconnectedness of our communities as well as our issues. Therefore, our solutions call for local, regional, national and global solidarity that confronts imperialism and militarism.” Our vision for a better future, for people and planet, means ensuring all of us can move , with free and reliable public transportation and streets that are safe for pedestrians and bikers. Our district must be a place where people can live . We need sustainable and dignified housing, and we need our next Councilmember to listen to NYCHA residents and respond to their needs. We deserve a city where all people thrive , and we will build it by fighting for good jobs and union jobs. We will return the district — from the power grid to the parks — to the people, ensuring a future with good jobs, breathable air, dignified homes and safe streets for us all. Freedom to move Every New Yorker deserves the freedom to move around their city. Our current transit system, once a source of great pride, is not only crumbling and unreliable, it also fails to serve many parts of the city. Black and brown, working-class neighborhoods like ours are chief among them. We demand a transit system that serves every New Yorker, dramatically reducing carbon emissions from car traffic and giving everyone the opportunity to move freely about their city. We also demand a city where bikers, including the delivery workers who rely on bikes for their labor, can safely travel to where they need to go. Electrify MTA buses and increase bus service. In District 38, our roads are narrow and may not always accommodate bus lane infrastructure in the ways other parts of Brooklyn or the City can; however, we can increase the frequency and reliability of using the bus by expanding bus service. For example, B63 services a lot of young students, and the bus can be too crowded for people to use. We need more buses along the B63 route, to accommodate the number of riders who depend on them. Bus routes in District 38, like the B63, received a D for speed and a D for reliability from Turnaround, an organization that advocates for improving the bus system. Improving bus service will mean easier commutes, less traffic and lower emissions. Expand raised boarding platforms, bus shelters including benches and real-time bus status displays throughout the full bus network. Citywide, initiate a massive expansion of protected busways , especially outside of the central business districts. More busways will allow us to increase service, adding more frequency. To do this, we can utilize pilot programs using portable street treatments like barriers, planters and precast curbs to rapidly expand, gather information, learn and improve our buses. Say no to the Brooklyn Queens Connector (BQX) , a light rail project that would connect trendy areas of Brooklyn and Queens, but doesn’t prioritize working-class communities . Deny all public funding and bond issuing for the BQX project, which prioritizes commuting for neighborhoods with high real-estate value. Improve bike lanes with protective concrete barriers and other infrastructure that will protect all riders, including the delivery people who risk their lives to provide an essential service . Additionally, provide the New York City Sanitation Department with adequate funding and appropriate equipment to maintain and clean bike lanes. The bike lanes on Sunset Park’s 4th Avenue are a major artery for commuters and delivery people. To make them truly safe for bikers, we must massively expand bicycle infrastructure by funding the Regional Plan Association’s (RPA) Five Borough Bikeway plan and create the backbone for a citywide network of protected bicycle infrastructure, a vital component of prioritizing sustainable transport. Fourth Avenue is unsafe. It needs to be revisited and completed — with appropriate signage, fixing the concrete and correcting apparent design problems. Take city control of Citi Bike , expanding it with necessary street infrastructure to working-class neighborhoods that its current for-profit operator has neglected. We need community input to ensure that Citi Bikes are where they’re supposed to be, so that they don’t create abrupt and serious bottlenecks and problems for working people who need to find parking. Integrate Citi Bike with the MTA bus and subway fare and transfer system. Explore integration with LIRR and MNR transfers. Add more bicycle types to Citi Bike for riders of varying abilities and needs (cargo, adaptive cycles, kids’s bikes, etc.) Design all new bike lanes to accommodate the newly legalized cargo e-bikes , a low-carbon impact way to move goods around the city. Push for progressive fares. Mass transit is the lifeblood of NYC; it should be free for everyone, including NYC public school students, and run democratically. Until then, we must implement progressive fare models under city purview, such as expanding Fair Fare s, making some or all buses free, and exploring new programs similar to the Atlantic Ticket . Our district has way too much truck traffic. As a requirement to do business in our neighborhoods, all medium and heavy-duty vehicles should be electrified . Use the land use process to scrutinize plans for new distribution centers and hold big corporations accountable Freedom to live Green New Deal for NYCHA The Green New Deal means fighting climate change while creating millions of good-paying, union jobs and prioritizing working-class neighborhoods and communities of color. The City Council has limited power over NYCHA. However, our Council can advocate for and demand a Green New Deal at the state and federal level. A Green New Deal for the New York City Housing Authority would mean making dramatic improvements to our current public housing, and building thousands of new, carbon-neutral units. This is critical for the Red Hook Houses, the largest NYCHA development in Brooklyn. Together, we can create over 300,000 union jobs over 10 years, generate billions of dollars for the local economy and, most importantly, prioritize housing all New Yorkers. In this process, Alexa will fight for and with NYCHA residents in Red Hook, who have suffered from decades of neglect. Demand services from NYCHA, and also leverage city services outside of NYCHA, to support and serve our public housing residents. Ensure that all retrofitting and repair jobs prioritize hiring NYCHA residents with union labor. Section 3 requires that when federal money is used for NYCHA projects, where possible, our public housing neighbors are hired for such jobs. However, this is woefully enforced. The City can be effective in monitoring and demanding that Section 3 be followed. Address immediate issues created by the FEMA funded Recovery and Resiliency project which include addressing safety concerns related to fencing and lighting; heat island impacts; and mitigation of particle pollution from the construction and dirt mounds. NYCHA must construct necessary shade structures to mitigate heat, a direct result of the massive tree removal on the campus. Such structures also offer residents places to socialize and enjoy the outdoors. Expedite repairs and provide funding to address residents’ most pressing health and safety needs, including mold removal and heat provision . Prioritize refurbishing and “greening” the Red Hook Houses , which need extensive maintenance and retrofits to guarantee safe housing with consistent heat, cooking gas , hot water, electricity and internet. Install modern, energy efficient appliances with lower maintenance and health costs in existing units. Implement retrofits that phase out oil and natural gas and set the stage for decarbonization. Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, Toward Renewable Energy As one of the largest cities in the world, New York must become a world leader when it comes to decarbonization. While the city’s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction, the reality is that the climate crisis has already begun, and we are already feeling the effects in Sunset Park and Red Hook. The City government must act boldly and creatively to fund and enact policy recommendations, outlined by the Climate Works for All Coalition in the Climate And Community Stimulus platform , and end New York’s dependence on fossil fuels. No more polluting infrastructure in the district, period. Fully fund and implement Local Law 97 and require all new buildings be net-zero carbon . Transition away from natural gas and fossil-fuel dependent steam. Ban natural gas hookups in all new construction and gut renovations. Provide assistance to low-income households buying energy-efficient appliances, induction stoves, and retrofits. Ban all new or replacement oil and gas infrastructure within the city. Enact a binding plan to retire existing, polluting, large-scale oil and gas infrastructure, including decommissioning of PEAKER plants Support public development of solar, wind and wave energy, and renewable heat pumps . Remove restrictions which hinder the development of clean, renewable energy sources, like fire codes which restrict the installation of battery storage. Invest in and expand community-owned renewable energy projects, like the Sunset Park Solar Cooperative and Resilient Red Hook’s community microgrid . Ensure that the City follows through with its obligation to support Renewable Rikers , which the Council voted on in early 2021. Renewable Rikers would replace the jail on Rikers Island with a solar array, battery storage and a wastewater treatment plant . For true justice for our communities, Alexa will fight to also support the permanent closure of the Rikers Island jail complex and demand an aggressive and actionable plan for decarceration, release and rehabilitation, while also looking to see how to positively use the land in which Rikers once stood. Take control of New York City’s power grid from the for-profit monopoly of Con Ed and give it to the people. Push for the State Legislature to pass a Public Power agenda. Invest in publicly-owned, renewable energy jobs by passing the Build Public Renewables Act at the state level. Take control from Con Ed and National Grid , the companies whose boards are responsible for the price-gouging, blackouts and brownouts, and other inequities that come with a privatized, commodified power grid, and municipalize New York City’s power. Require cruise ships docked at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal to use “shore power,” turn off their idling engines and plug into the on-shore grid. This will eliminate a major source of carbon emissions and improve the air quality of our district. Freedom to thrive More green spaces don’t just make our city prettier; they can also lower our carbon footprint and defend us against flooding. To make our city more livable, more sustainable and more equitable, we must allocate at least 1 percent of the City budget for the Parks Department. This money would support the much-needed operations and maintenance to ensure our parks are safe, clean and accessible. Critically, the Parks Department’s funding and work must prioritize Black and brown communities, where unemployment is highest and green space is inaccessible and/or inadequate. Create an inter-agency sidewalk maintenance and improvement corps , which can span the Departments of Sanitation, Parks and Recreation, and Transportation. This will create new union jobs to make sidewalks ADA compliant, and improve their resilience. Improve and expand equitable waste-management practices, both across the district and citywide. Fully fund composting and require it citywide , while educating residents and investing in borough-based composting sites. Support all district public schools, among all public facilities, to move toward zero waste. Significantly Increase the number of trash cans throughout the district and trash pick-up in high traffic areas. Support the full implementation of the Commercial Waste Zones. Support the local development of Barcelona-style superblocks , an urban planning design which restricts cars to certain streets, frees up streets for public spaces and promotes equitable access to green spaces. Expand and make permanent the city’s successful COVID-era Open Streets program , especially in Black, brown and working-class communities that continue to have disproportionately fewer open streets — and more traffic violence. Open Streets should be fully implemented and adequately funded. Prioritize expansion in neighborhoods without access to open green space , working with community members to choose pilot sites. There are only two Open Streets in Sunset Park , along with a smattering of block-sized Open Streets in Red Hook, compared with large stretches of Broadway in Manhattan and long, intersecting streets at the heart of Williamsburg. Ensure Open Streets are municipally operated, outfitted with public seating and include accessible bathrooms. Massively expand our urban forest , both in the district, and citywide. District 38 still has blocks without even one tree. Trees are one of the greatest single investments our city can make to combat climate change while supporting the health and well-being of residents.  We should invest in intergenerational programs to support tree stewardship and maintenance of our green spaces. Build more parks and open space, while ensuring existing neighborhood parks are clean and safe. Although New York City has recently begun investing in renovating neglected parks across the city, park maintenance remains woefully underfunded. Parks in affluent neighborhoods have private conservancies to help maintain them, while parks in working-class neighborhoods face litter, crumbling sidewalks and equipment, and a lack of facilities. Growing the workforce will create jobs while addressing this disparity. Water fountains are critical infrastructure for the unhoused, and they benefit the entire community. Upgrade all water fountains to make them freeze-resistant so they can stay on all year, following the example of Prospect Park . Access to fresh, affordable food is a critical need, further magnified by the pandemic. We must support community-led sustainable food systems that ensure all our neighbors have access to the nutrition they need. Strike all parking minimums from city zoning. These minimums are a gift to the fossil fuel industry — it’s time we let communities plan their development according to their needs, in coordination with DOT transportation and accessibility experts. Resilience District 38 understands the threat of climate change, particularly when it comes to severe storms and flooding. We are still feeling the effects of Superstorm Sandy, and as we recover we must also protect ourselves from future storms. Alexa understands what’s at stake and recognizes that this challenge is also an opportunity for our district and our city to demonstrate what a green, resilient and prepared future looks like. Give neighbors ownership of their resilience and preparedness plans. Designate Sunset Park New York City’s first Green Resilient Industrial District . Designate space and submit Requests for Proposals for green industries. Retrofit all businesses in city-owned properties and develop programs that assist businesses in greening operations and practices . Provide workforce training in green building trades, offshore wind and vehicle electrification and community engagement and training. Advocate for government commitments to provide technical and financial support for Sunset Park business and property owners to reduce their carbon emissions . Invest in nature-based coastal resiliency that protects communities from extreme weather events. Change the NYC property tax code to require developers in Flood Zones 1 and 2 who benefited from tax breaks and city subsidies to pay a “resiliency tax,” which would pay for necessary coastal resiliency improvements in their respective flood zones. Use rain gardens, porous paving materials, and other means of upgrading our infrastructure to lessen the threat of floods . Open the waterfront so that it is useful to those who need it. According to PortSide New York , the City, “found a way to mandate ‘public access to the waterfront’ when property is re-zoned,” but did not create a way to use the waterways themselves. Those who use the waterfront and its waterways — the working-class neighbors who live and work there — should be the first to propose plans for those areas. Environmental justice: Our vision for a sustainable and resilient district Every New Yorker deserves the ability to move, to live, to thrive. Alexa is running for City Council to protect these basic, necessary human rights and freedoms. If you’ve spent even a moment in District 38, you know that it is lively and bustling — with awe-inspiring vistas, a park that overlooks our beautiful city, and good neighbors, who interact with our city’s streets, buildings, trees and waterfront every day as they work, raise families and take care of one another. Alexa will preserve our district’s vibrancy by fighting for environmental justice that includes good, clean jobs — so that every District 38 resident can count on reliable public transportation, dignified and sustainable housing, clean air to breathe, and community ownership of our land and resources. Climate change is hitting frontline communities like ours hard and fast. The Red Hook Houses, the largest public housing complex in Brooklyn, have never recovered from Superstorm Sandy nor preceding decades of divestment. NYCHA has been unable to address appalling conditions, at times leaving residents stuck with toxic mold, no heat, no water and no means to cook. And all of us suffer from poor air quality, whether from traffic along the Gowanus Expressway or from cruise ships idling at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. Environmental racism is not a coincidence — it is a product of a capitalist system that puts profit before people and sells out our fresh air, water and health to private interests. As District 38’s next City Councilmember, Alexa will prioritize community-driven land use with a vision for resiliency and good, green jobs, in partnership with the District’s long-standing neighborhood leaders. Industry City’s vision for the Sunset Park waterfront was wrong for the working-class people of our district. We need a community plan that ushers in a just transition for workers and the planet. Residents of our district walk or take public transit more than the average New Yorker, and more of them work in local retail corridors and in manufacturing and light industrial firms along the waterfront. Workers in sectors servicing the building trades, like those along the waterfront, are more likely to earn higher wages and have union benefits, and we must prioritize creating good jobs like these for workers without a college degree. As major companies explore investments along the Sunset Park and Red Hook waterfront, and the City’s landmark energy efficiency law draws new investment in existing construction and light manufacturing firms, we must compel firms, the City and the State to respect their workers and judge new development based on whether or not it delivers racial, environmental and economic justice, maximizing community leverage in a citywide land use process. According to the Climate Justice Alliance, whose work informs this platform, “Just Transition must be liberatory and transformative. The impacts of the extractive economy knows no borders. We recognize the interconnectedness of our communities as well as our issues. Therefore, our solutions call for local, regional, national and global solidarity that confronts imperialism and militarism.” Our vision for a better future, for people and planet, means ensuring all of us can move , with free and reliable public transportation and streets that are safe for pedestrians and bikers. Our district must be a place where people can live . We need sustainable and dignified housing, and we need our next Councilmember to listen to NYCHA residents and respond to their needs. We deserve a city where all people thrive , and we will build it by fighting for good jobs and union jobs. We will return the district — from the power grid to the parks — to the people, ensuring a future with good jobs, breathable air, dignified homes and safe streets for us all.  Freedom to move Every New Yorker deserves the freedom to move around their city. Our current transit system, once a source of great pride, is not only crumbling and unreliable, it also fails to serve many parts of the city. Black and brown, working-class neighborhoods like ours are chief among them. We demand a transit system that serves every New Yorker, dramatically reducing carbon emissions from car traffic and giving everyone the opportunity to move freely about their city. We also demand a city where bikers, including the delivery workers who rely on bikes for their labor, can safely travel to where they need to go. Electrify MTA buses and increase bus service. In District 38, our roads are narrow and may not always accommodate bus lane infrastructure in the ways other parts of Brooklyn or the City can; however, we can increase the frequency and reliability of using the bus by expanding bus service. For example, B63 services a lot of young students, and the bus can be too crowded for people to use. We need more buses along the B63 route, to accommodate the number of riders who depend on them. Bus routes in District 38, like the B63, received a D for speed and a D for reliability from Turnaround, an organization that advocates for improving the bus system. Improving bus service will mean easier commutes, less traffic and lower emissions. Expand raised boarding platforms, bus shelters including benches and real-time bus status displays throughout the full bus network. Electrify MTA buses and increase bus service.

Citywide, initiate a massive expansion of protected busways , especially outside of the central business districts. More busways will allow us to increase service, adding more frequency. To do this, we can utilize pilot programs using portable street treatments like barriers, planters and precast curbs to rapidly expand, gather information, learn and improve our buses.

Improve bike lanes with protective concrete barriers and other infrastructure that will protect all riders, including the delivery people who risk their lives to provide an essential service . Additionally, provide the New York City Sanitation Department with adequate funding and appropriate equipment to maintain and clean bike lanes. The bike lanes on Sunset Park’s 4th Avenue are a major artery for commuters and delivery people. To make them truly safe for bikers, we must massively expand bicycle infrastructure by funding the Regional Plan Association’s (RPA) Five Borough Bikeway plan and create the backbone for a citywide network of protected bicycle infrastructure, a vital component of prioritizing sustainable transport. Fourth Avenue is unsafe. It needs to be revisited and completed — with appropriate signage, fixing the concrete and correcting apparent design problems. Take city control of Citi Bike , expanding it with necessary street infrastructure to working-class neighborhoods that its current for-profit operator has neglected. We need community input to ensure that Citi Bikes are where they’re supposed to be, so that they don’t create abrupt and serious bottlenecks and problems for working people who need to find parking. Integrate Citi Bike with the MTA bus and subway fare and transfer system. Explore integration with LIRR and MNR transfers. Add more bicycle types to Citi Bike for riders of varying abilities and needs (cargo, adaptive cycles, kids’s bikes, etc.) Design all new bike lanes to accommodate the newly legalized cargo e-bikes , a low-carbon impact way to move goods around the city.

Mass transit is the lifeblood of NYC; it should be free for everyone, including NYC public school students, and run democratically. Until then, we must implement progressive fare models under city purview, such as expanding Fair Fare s, making some or all buses free, and exploring new programs similar to the Atlantic Ticket .

The City Council has limited power over NYCHA. However, our Council can advocate for and demand a Green New Deal at the state and federal level. A Green New Deal for the New York City Housing Authority would mean making dramatic improvements to our current public housing, and building thousands of new, carbon-neutral units. This is critical for the Red Hook Houses, the largest NYCHA development in Brooklyn. Together, we can create over 300,000 union jobs over 10 years, generate billions of dollars for the local economy and, most importantly, prioritize housing all New Yorkers. In this process, Alexa will fight for and with NYCHA residents in Red Hook, who have suffered from decades of neglect. Demand services from NYCHA, and also leverage city services outside of NYCHA, to support and serve our public housing residents. Demand services from NYCHA, and also leverage city services outside of NYCHA, to support and serve our public housing residents. Ensure that all retrofitting and repair jobs prioritize hiring NYCHA residents with union labor. Section 3 requires that when federal money is used for NYCHA projects, where possible, our public housing neighbors are hired for such jobs. However, this is woefully enforced. The City can be effective in monitoring and demanding that Section 3 be followed. Ensure that all retrofitting and repair jobs prioritize hiring NYCHA residents with union labor.

Address immediate issues created by the FEMA funded Recovery and Resiliency project which include addressing safety concerns related to fencing and lighting; heat island impacts; and mitigation of particle pollution from the construction and dirt mounds. NYCHA must construct necessary shade structures to mitigate heat, a direct result of the massive tree removal on the campus. Such structures also offer residents places to socialize and enjoy the outdoors.

Parks in affluent neighborhoods have private conservancies to help maintain them, while parks in working-class neighborhoods face litter, crumbling sidewalks and equipment, and a lack of facilities. Growing the workforce will create jobs while addressing this disparity. Build more parks and open space, while ensuring existing neighborhood parks are clean and safe.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Education equity: A vision for the future of our schools Quality education is a human right, not a business, not a commodity to be sold to those with the most money. Alexa is a union-backed mom who joined the fight for education justice because of her experiences as a parent. The mother of two public school students, she has witnessed the inequities and injustices of NYC’s school system firsthand. In nearly a decade as president of the Parent-Teacher Association of her daughters’ school, Alexa dramatically expanded the PTA’s budget and secured funding and equipment for a number of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) programs. She also fought to give parents a voice in their children’s education, bridging linguistic divides, and bringing to light issues related to overcrowding, culturally responsive curricula and learning environments, IEP support, and more. During her tenure, Alexa learned that politics is about talking to people — in this case, bringing teachers, parents, and students together — learning what they need, and recognizing the power of solidarity to fight for what we deserve. The crises of the last year have made painfully clear the ways in which our education system perpetuates injustice, particularly for working-class, immigrant communities of color, like ours in City Council District 38. According to the Alliance for Quality Education, even before the pandemic swept through the state, New York was ranked 49th in the nation in terms of educational equity. The organization further notes that “8 out of 10 Black and Latinx students attend a school that has been systematically underfunded by the state.” Elected leaders at every level of government must recognize that fully funding our public schools is essential to the future of our city, but that investment alone will not undo the damage. Today, schools across the city, particularly those of District 38, are overcrowded and understaffed, lacking a proper number of teachers and counselors. COVID, has devastated our community, leaving schools gutted of resources, and families and school workers struggling to ensure that students have what they need to survive. Here is how we can right the many wrongs that have been done to our students and transform our education system into the cornerstone of a just society: Fund our schools As our City Council Member, Alexa will insist our public schools receive the funding they are owed. She will fight to redirect funds from the bloated NYPD and other wasteful and unjust systems of city government, and toward our public schools. Alexa will also stand up to the privatization of education and push the City to stop subsidizing charter schools that drain our public school system of resources. According to the United Federation of Teachers , for the 2020 - 2021 school year, “NYC expects to see its charter school expenditures increased by $93 million — now costing the city over $2.3 billion.” Together, we will organize to demand full funding from the State and the City for early childhood education, K-12 schools, CUNY, and adult education. Make no mistake — there is more than enough money in New York to give every single person a quality education. But we need to fight for it. Fully fund PreK-12 schools, CUNY, and adult education , allowing us to hire more teachers and counselors, expand language access, and foster culturally responsive learning environments. Simply taxing the rich at the state level will generate the funds we need to implement dramatic improvements at every level of education — from our youngest students to adults furthering their education at our city colleges. We must pass the Invest in Our New York Act in 2021, and advocate for similar legislation in the future. Truly universal early childhood education for District 38 . The expansion of early childhood education over the last eight years in New York City has been a major success, but working families in District 38 are struggling to find available spots, as most 3-K for All programs are full. For 3-K for All to be truly universal, we need adequate funding and for our community in South Brooklyn to be prioritized. Demand that the State pay the over $1.4 billion it owes NYC public schools in Foundation Aid. Although a grueling legal battle ended with the NYS Court of Appeals ruling that the state must increase public school funding in 2006, the State has not paid the full amount it owes since 2008. The City must hold the State accountable for the funding our students deserve. Recalibrate the DOE budget so that it invests in a positive school climate, not in high-stakes testing, unethical contracts and more. Stop the privatization of education . Place a moratorium on new charter schools, stop using public money to pay charter schools’ rent, and work with the DOE to develop a process that brings charter schools back under public control. At the same time, the co-location of public schools with charter schools needs to end. Invest in youth services. We must fund programs that create meaningful education and employment programs that enhance opportunities, especially for 16- and 24-year-olds who are out of school and out of work. Fully fund the Summer Youth Employment Program and expand workforce programs. Address the injustices of our education system Alexa has seen firsthand how our public schools exemplify some of the worst inequalities that afflict our city. Teachers are overworked, underpaid, and forced to work without the equipment and training they need to serve our students. Our school workers’ working conditions are our students’ learning conditions. We must pay our teachers fairly and give them the resources to foster their students’ growth. We must also equip them to handle the challenges of their workplace. We must shift the power dynamic in public schools, centering parents, students, educators and staff in decision-making. This is necessary if we are to acutely address the social and emotional needs of our children and create a comprehensive recovery plan after COVID that addresses their trauma and the learning lost in 2020 and 2021. It is critical that we get the police out of our public schools, replacing  them with the professionals who understand our students’ needs and whose goal is to help them develop, not to put them on the path to incarceration. Over-policing in schools increases youth imprisonment along racial and economic lines, according to the NYCLU . Together, we can make NYC public schools welcoming places, where every worker has all they need to best serve our students, where no one feels threatened, and where every student, teacher, and family is valued. Equip each student with the tools they need to succeed in school. During the pandemic, we saw that many students do not have access to the devices they need, like working laptops, iPads and more. Just as books are essential for students to learn, so is up-to-date and workable technology. Create and adequately fund programs for those with differing abilities. District 38 is deprived of special education resources, and children in our community have to travel across Brooklyn — sometimes even to different boroughs — to receive the attention and care they deserve. This is a funding problem for existing programs, but it’s also a problem in how we plan for new schools. When we build new schools, we can create the spaces for students with special needs to thrive. We must also ensure that special education classes are fully staffed. Address shortages in bilingual special education evaluations and classes. Expand specialized programs, like Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Nest and ASD Horizon , and develop new ones. Clean the backlog of special education cases. Ensure that all school communications are available in the languages spoken by parents. DOE policy explicitly calls for universal language access so that all families can participate in their child's education, and the department provides some resources to schools. But its implementation since 2009 has been uneven at best. In many schools, the designated language access coordinator is also the parent coordinator — a part-time and undervalued position. We need to both ensure that money for translation and interpretation actually gets used and goes toward supporting language access, and we must also expand the resources available to schools. Focus on reducing class sizes. Reduced class sizes should be our main criteria for improving school quality. Although there are costs to reducing class sizes, the NEA notes that not reducing class sizes could be costlier, considering greater dropout rates and fewer opportunities for students who don’t receive a quality education. Taxing the rich and funding our schools is paramount to ensuring we have the educators and staff needed for schools to function, but New York City can get creative, too. Rather than focusing on test scores, the school system could redirect funds from testing contracts to hire more teachers and reduce class sizes. Other cities like Rochester have been able to reduce class sizes from kindergarten to fourth grade at low costs by reallocating resources across the system. Increase support for English-Language Learners (ELLs), and prioritize smaller ELL classroom sizes. According to Advocates for Children of New York , only about 27% of ELL students graduated high school by their fourth year in 2017. We need to ensure that ELL students not only receive the correct accommodations , but that they are given the tools to succeed in school and advance to the next grade level. For ELL students, the problem of overcrowding in our schools is particularly acute . We need small class sizes, so that students have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Adopt culturally responsive, anti-racist curricula and practices. Students, teachers and parents should each take part in deciding what curricula and practices their school adopts. Hire, train and place more social workers, counsellors and mental health professionals; develop trauma-informed curricula; and educate teachers in de-escalation techniques, breaking the school-to-prison pipeline and giving our students the support they deserve. End the school-to-prison pipeline. Get cops and metal detectors out of schools. Parents, students and school workers have been repeating this for years: Cops in our schools don’t make any of us safer. The NYPD’s presence only serves to perpetuate the unjust and racist school-to-prison pipeline , disproportionately targeting Black and brown youth. Create a citywide trauma-informed disciplinary policy that applies equally to district and charter schools, which have a history of higher suspension rates. Work with administrators, teachers, and staff to change the culture of discipline , practicing restorative justice rather than punitive measures. Students should have the ability to learn responsible methods to cope and adjust their behavior. Furthermore, we should encourage peer-to-peer connection, accountability, care and conflict resolution. Emphasize bilingual and multilingual learning. We need to ensure that there are adequate resources for biliteracy, which means that we both need adequate funding, and more comprehensive planning to ensure these services go where they are needed. These services should be equitably distributed to students with special needs, too. Rezone to desegregate our schools. NYC schools remain some of the most segregated in the entire country. We need to redraw our school district lines with feedback from local communities, and move to a district-based lottery system that ensures that wealthy students aren’t pre-selected for the best schools. Comprehensive rezoning and greater sharing of resources across the system are tools to combat racial and economic segregation in our schools and communities. In order to support teachers, students, and families during COVID and beyond, we need to demand fair wages and just working conditions for all public educators and school staff . During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were often told to accept the false dichotomy between supporting students’ learning and protecting teachers’ health and safety. Alexa knows that safe working conditions for teachers mean better learning conditions for students. Families and school workers must stand united in demanding vaccination for themselves and their communities, safe conditions in schools, and support for working parents who need to balance their children’s remote learning. The pandemic has also made clear the physical infrastructure issues in our school buildings, such as lack of ventilation . These issues aren’t new, and have continually posed health threats to teachers, students, and staff. COVID makes such problems all the more pressing. We must upgrade existing schools and design new ones with the health of everyone in the community in mind. Transition away from high-stakes testing and evaluate students in ways that teachers recommend: portfolios, presentations, research papers, and more. Remove academic screens like the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), which have been proven to segregate schools along racial and economic lines. Fund free tutoring services for all students . Experts tell us that individual tutoring helps kids learn. Alexa will push to expand tutoring programs like the one piloted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and to give them City funding, so that educators receive the pay they deserve for giving our children the tutoring they deserve. Create a new DOE Office for Students in Foster Care and Temporary Housing . One in 10 New York City public school students is experiencing homelessness, and kids in foster care are considerably less likely to graduate high school than their peers. A new citywide office designed specifically to help these students would have an immediate impact on our most vulnerable and help break the cycle of poverty. Protect student privacy. Parents should be informed if private e-learning vendors are collecting data on students, how that data is used, and have the ability to opt out. There have to be basic quality standards and vetting for vendors that the DOE works with, even during times like the transition to e-learning due to the pandemic. Build schools that serve our communities Schools can and should serve as centers of a thriving community. Alexa believes schools can be places that develop students, educators, families, and communities — so that they can build a better world. To create this better future for our schools, we’ll need to act with creativity, boldness, and, most importantly, solidarity. There are five new schools being built in District 38. It is critical that parents’, students’ and school workers’ voices shape each new building’s design and functionality — along with the grades served by each school, and where they’re located. District 38 needs middle and high schools, not only more elementary schools. Equity is embedded in infrastructure. Schools must also reflect the core values of the community, particularly along the lines of climate and social justice. We know that the best way to integrate such values into school planning is by centering educators, parents and students. New housing must be coupled with new schools. To ease overcrowding, our planning and zoning code need provisions that necessitate school infrastructure. Make CUNY free again . For nearly 130 years, our city’s colleges were like the rest of our public schools: free . Education is a human right, and as such we must again provide free college to all New Yorkers who seek a college degree. Every school should be a place where communities can find information and care . Our libraries must be well-stocked, and there must be an adequate number of trained nurses at every school. Expand after-school programs so that students of all ages have a place to enrich their education with programs that highlight and expand their skill sets in areas like language, painting, photography, technology, cooking, dancing, and more. For elementary-aged students who can’t stay home alone, there should be free after school programs in every school. Reach out to families to emphasize the importance of early childhood education. Community outreach is critical to ensure equal access to early childhood education for all District 38 families. Make space for parent voice and engagement. Create a mechanism that supports equity across PTAs, like a shared pool or enhanced financial and capacity support using a weighted equity formula. For context, some PTA budgets in School District 15, which includes Park Slope in addition to Sunset Park and Red Hook, are $30,000. Others raise $1 million a year. Fund and partner with programs that place dentists , immigrant-rights advocates, and other support directly into schools where students need them. As a result of state budget cuts, the Community Schools Initiative faces a $9 million cut. Hundreds of students are set to lose out on access to health and dental clinics, counselors, and social workers as a result. We must restore funding to this program and expand partnerships with similar programs to ensure that our schools meet the needs of our students. Push for free public internet in NYC to put an end to the inequality that currently prevents many students from attending online classes and many parents from contacting their childrens’ schools. 46% of New York City households living in poverty do not have broadband at home, including a majority of Black/African American or Hispanic households. This inequality has put children in our community at a major disadvantage, particularly in the last year. We must ensure that our students have internet access at home so that they can succeed in school. Identify and invest in ways of communicating with parents whose work, language, etc. currently prevents them from learning about their children’s education and participating in the school community. Fight for inclusive schools , where gender justice is a priority. This includes consent-based, queer-inclusive curricula and an end to arbitrary sex segregation in schools (i.e. boys and girls lines). It also means that adolescent girls, particularly girls of color, shouldn’t be disciplined based on their gender — scolded over dress-code restrictions, chastised over antiquated ideas of gendered speech patterns or talkativeness, etc. Connect high school students with jobs programs in their communities that gives them access to new opportunities and professional networks. Council Members and City Offices should bring youth leaders and fellows into their offices to learn and grow. This is dear to Alexa’s heart, and we seek to model it in our campaign. Make it free for our kids to get around the city. Three rides a day is not enough for many students who have jobs in addition to school. The MTA should be free for all, but we can start by making Student Metrocards unlimited . This is a transit justice issue, and one of many reasons to demand that the city take control of the MTA back from the state. Expand the Teaching Fellows program and advocate for alternative ways to train more Black and brown educators as well as multilingual educators . Education equity: A vision for the future of our schools Quality education is a human right, not a business, not a commodity to be sold to those with the most money. Alexa is a union-backed mom who joined the fight for education justice because of her experiences as a parent. The mother of two public school students, she has witnessed the inequities and injustices of NYC’s school system firsthand. In nearly a decade as president of the Parent-Teacher Association of her daughters’ school, Alexa dramatically expanded the PTA’s budget and secured funding and equipment for a number of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) programs. She also fought to give parents a voice in their children’s education, bridging linguistic divides, and bringing to light issues related to overcrowding, culturally responsive curricula and learning environments, IEP support, and more. During her tenure, Alexa learned that politics is about talking to people — in this case, bringing teachers, parents, and students together — learning what they need, and recognizing the power of solidarity to fight for what we deserve. The crises of the last year have made painfully clear the ways in which our education system perpetuates injustice, particularly for working-class, immigrant communities of color, like ours in City Council District 38. According to the Alliance for Quality Education, even before the pandemic swept through the state, New York was ranked 49th in the nation in terms of educational equity. The organization further notes that “8 out of 10 Black and Latinx students attend a school that has been systematically underfunded by the state.” Elected leaders at every level of government must recognize that fully funding our public schools is essential to the future of our city, but that investment alone will not undo the damage. Today, schools across the city, particularly those of District 38, are overcrowded and understaffed, lacking a proper number of teachers and counselors. COVID, has devastated our community, leaving schools gutted of resources, and families and school workers struggling to ensure that students have what they need to survive. Here is how we can right the many wrongs that have been done to our students and transform our education system into the cornerstone of a just society: Fund our schools As our City Council Member, Alexa will insist our public schools receive the funding they are owed. She will fight to redirect funds from the bloated NYPD and other wasteful and unjust systems of city government, and toward our public schools. Alexa will also stand up to the privatization of education and push the City to stop subsidizing charter schools that drain our public school system of resources. According to the United Federation of Teachers , for the 2020 - 2021 school year, “NYC expects to see its charter school expenditures increased by $93 million — now costing the city over $2.3 billion.” Together, we will organize to demand full funding from the State and the City for early childhood education, K-12 schools, CUNY, and adult education. Make no mistake — there is more than enough money in New York to give every single person a quality education. But we need to fight for it. Fully fund PreK-12 schools, CUNY, and adult education , allowing us to hire more teachers and counselors, expand language access, and foster culturally responsive learning environments. Simply taxing the rich at the state level will generate the funds we need to implement dramatic improvements at every level of education — from our youngest students to adults furthering their education at our city colleges. We must pass the Invest in Our New York Act in 2021, and advocate for similar legislation in the future.

The expansion of early childhood education over the last eight years in New York City has been a major success, but working families in District 38 are struggling to find available spots, as most 3-K for All programs are full. For 3-K for All to be truly universal, we need adequate funding and for our community in South Brooklyn to be prioritized. Truly universal early childhood education for District 38 .

Demand that the State pay the over $1.4 billion it owes NYC public schools in Foundation Aid. Although a grueling legal battle ended with the NYS Court of Appeals ruling that the state must increase public school funding in 2006, the State has not paid the full amount it owes since 2008. The City must hold the State accountable for the funding our students deserve. Demand that the State pay the over $1.4 billion it owes NYC public schools in Foundation Aid.

Recalibrate the DOE budget so that it invests in a positive school climate, not in high-stakes testing, unethical contracts and more.

Place a moratorium on new charter schools, stop using public money to pay charter schools’ rent, and work with the DOE to develop a process that brings charter schools back under public control. At the same time, the co-location of public schools with charter schools needs to end. Stop the privatization of education .

We must fund programs that create meaningful education and employment programs that enhance opportunities, especially for 16- and 24-year-olds who are out of school and out of work. Fully fund the Summer Youth Employment Program and expand workforce programs. Invest in youth services.

Fully fund the Summer Youth Employment Program and expand workforce programs. Address the injustices of our education system Alexa has seen firsthand how our public schools exemplify some of the worst inequalities that afflict our city. Teachers are overworked, underpaid, and forced to work without the equipment and training they need to serve our students. Our school workers’ working conditions are our students’ learning conditions. We must pay our teachers fairly and give them the resources to foster their students’ growth. We must also equip them to handle the challenges of their workplace. We must shift the power dynamic in public schools, centering parents, students, educators and staff in decision-making. This is necessary if we are to acutely address the social and emotional needs of our children and create a comprehensive recovery plan after COVID that addresses their trauma and the learning lost in 2020 and 2021. It is critical that we get the police out of our public schools, replacing  them with the professionals who understand our students’ needs and whose goal is to help them develop, not to put them on the path to incarceration. Over-policing in schools increases youth imprisonment along racial and economic lines, according to the NYCLU . Together, we can make NYC public schools welcoming places, where every worker has all they need to best serve our students, where no one feels threatened, and where every student, teacher, and family is valued. Equip each student with the tools they need to succeed in school. During the pandemic, we saw that many students do not have access to the devices they need, like working laptops, iPads and more. Just as books are essential for students to learn, so is up-to-date and workable technology. Equip each student with the tools they need to succeed in school.

It is critical that parents’, students’ and school workers’ voices shape each new building’s design and functionality — along with the grades served by each school, and where they’re located. District 38 needs middle and high schools, not only more elementary schools. Equity is embedded in infrastructure.

For nearly 130 years, our city’s colleges were like the rest of our public schools: free . Education is a human right, and as such we must again provide free college to all New Yorkers who seek a college degree. Make CUNY free again .

Expand after-school programs so that students of all ages have a place to enrich their education with programs that highlight and expand their skill sets in areas like language, painting, photography, technology, cooking, dancing, and more. For elementary-aged students who can’t stay home alone, there should be free after school programs in every school.

Create a mechanism that supports equity across PTAs, like a shared pool or enhanced financial and capacity support using a weighted equity formula. For context, some PTA budgets in School District 15, which includes Park Slope in addition to Sunset Park and Red Hook, are $30,000. Others raise $1 million a year.

Fund and partner with programs that place dentists , immigrant-rights advocates, and other support directly into schools where students need them. As a result of state budget cuts, the Community Schools Initiative faces a $9 million cut. Hundreds of students are set to lose out on access to health and dental clinics, counselors, and social workers as a result. We must restore funding to this program and expand partnerships with similar programs to ensure that our schools meet the needs of our students.

Push for free public internet in NYC to put an end to the inequality that currently prevents many students from attending online classes and many parents from contacting their childrens’ schools. 46% of New York City households living in poverty do not have broadband at home, including a majority of Black/African American or Hispanic households. This inequality has put children in our community at a major disadvantage, particularly in the last year.

Fight for inclusive schools , where gender justice is a priority. This includes consent-based, queer-inclusive curricula and an end to arbitrary sex segregation in schools (i.e. boys and girls lines). It also means that adolescent girls, particularly girls of color, shouldn’t be disciplined based on their gender — scolded over dress-code restrictions, chastised over antiquated ideas of gendered speech patterns or talkativeness, etc. Fight for inclusive schools , where gender justice is a priority.

Council Members and City Offices should bring youth leaders and fellows into their offices to learn and grow. This is dear to Alexa’s heart, and we seek to model it in our campaign.

Make it free for our kids to get around the city. Three rides a day is not enough for many students who have jobs in addition to school. The MTA should be free for all, but we can start by making Student Metrocards unlimited . This is a transit justice issue, and one of many reasons to demand that the city take control of the MTA back from the state. Make it free for our kids to get around the city.

0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu About Alexa Alexa Avilés has lived in Sunset Park for nearly two decades. As a proud Boricua, education organizer, mother, and democratic socialist, she is driven by service — to her community, to her family, and to New York City. Since joining the New York City Council in 2022, Alexa has stood strong for the communities of South Brooklyn fighting for housing for all, fully funded public schools, and a people-centered budget at City Hall. She’s sponsored dozens of bills that deliver for District 38 residents, and fights for a city government that works for the working class. A product of East New York, Brooklyn, Alexa is fueled by her family’s struggles, resilience, and deep commitment to service. As a child, Alexa watched her mother help young people rebuild their lives after experiencing poverty, incarceration, and substance-abuse disorders. Her mother’s strength laid a solid foundation of love and hope for Alexa’s family and for her relationship with her community. It also inspired her vision for a better Brooklyn and a better New York City. Building and using the collective power of her communities is at the core of this vision. The first in her family to attend college, Alexa graduated from Columbia University, then from Baruch College’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. Alexa has dedicated her career to community philanthropy, working to keep young people and adults out of our country’s criminal injustice system. She is also an organizer and activist who has continually supported the revitalization of native cultures and languages. Before joining the Council, she most recently served as the Program Director for the Scherman Foundation, funding local and national organizations working on human rights, the arts, and NYC community issues. Alexa has been proud to serve her community on a local level. Alexa served as the PS 172 PTA president for a decade, partnering with other parents to build programs, address families’ needs, and support neighborhood children. She was also a member of her local Community Board 7, served as a Parent Representative of the M.S. 88 School Leadership Team, and chaired the New York City Youth Board. She is also a member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America, and volunteered both as the Chair of the Personnel and Internal Budget Committee and as Vice-Chair of the Youth and Education Committee on Brooklyn Community Board 7. As a Latina, a mom, and your neighbor, Alexa is sensible and pragmatic. Alexa’s husband Frankie is a TWU Local 101 Member and lifelong resident of Red Hook and Sunset Park, and her intensely political daughters fuel her drive to build a better world. Inspired by her family and neighbors, Alexa is fighting for a society where every person can live with dignity in a healthy and safe community. Juntos podemos luchar por una sociedad mejor para todos. Together we can fight for a better society for all. Donate Volunteer About Alexa Alexa Avilés has lived in Sunset Park for nearly two decades.
