Allen Wang Work Posts ブログ記事 About I'm the Co-Founder and CTO of Outerport .  I was recently at Tome, an AI startup helping with making presentations. I was a founding member of the ML team and involved heavily across ML and product, seeing user growth from <1M to 20M. Before that I worked on computer vision for self driving at Embark Trucks. I received a master’s degree from University of Waterloo, where I did theoretical research at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical optimization, and made small contributions to the fields. I received my undergraduate degree also from Waterloo, where I majored in computer science and mathematics. Between school terms, I interned at companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and startups in San Francisco. I was born in China, and great up in Japan and Canada. I spent my childhood in Tsukuba, Japan, where I learned about friendship, and right and wrong.
