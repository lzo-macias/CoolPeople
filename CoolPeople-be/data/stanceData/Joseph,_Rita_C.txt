Rita Joseph Rita Joseph     Elect Assuming office January 1, 2022 Assuming office Mathieu Eugene  Democratic Rita Joseph is a Haitian-born American educator, activist, and politician. She is the Democratic nominee for the 40th district of the New York City Council – tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district, which covers Flatbush and several other neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Early life and education 
Joseph grew up in Flatbush after immigrating from Haiti at a young age. Joseph graduated from the now-closed- Sarah J. Hale High School. Joseph holds a bachelor’s in science in Liberal Arts from St. Francis College and a dual master’s degree in General and Special Education from Touro College. Career 
Joseph began her political involvement at just nineteen years old, when she organized her first rally with a group she founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism in order to protest the FDA's discriminatory "bad blood" rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the rule. Joseph has organized numerous community events such as toy drives, community street fairs. She served as Chairwoman of the Neighborhood Advisory Board and has been a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee since 2018. At PS6, Joseph serves as the ESL Coordinator. 2021 City Council Campaign In 2019, Joseph announced her 2021 campaign to succeed Mathieu Eugene for the 40th  Council district. Rita Joseph received endorsements from State Senator John Liu, former NYC Council speaker Melissa Mark Viverito, 21 in ‘21, 1199SEIU (her sole union endorsement),  and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC. Notably, Joseph was not endorsed by her own union, the UFT, who endorsed her opponent, Josue Pierre. Joseph won the 11-way primary in a landslide victory, with 25.3% of the first-round RCV vote and 59.6% of the final-round RCV vote. Her main competition came from Josue Pierre, the cousin of Assemblymember and Kings County Democratic Party Chairwoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn. Joseph announced victory following the primary and faces minimal resistance in the November election. Platform Joseph’s 2021 platform was focused on improving public schools, fighting for affordable housing, and enacting criminal justice reform. Joseph intends to govern in a collaborative manner with her constituents, writing “For too long, elected officials have made decisions for, rather than with, working people. My candidacy is dedicated to changing that.” Joseph currently lives in Flatbush. She is a member of the Holy Innocent Catholic Church in Flatbush.  This article "Rita Joseph" is from Wikipedia .

Mistranscriptions Misdiarizations , where the AI gets speakers wrong. Misdiarizations You might see these errors when you view a transcript. Large language models (LLMs) are very good at picking up on transcription and diarization errors using context clues.

Because it's not necessary to generate the artifacts you see on citymeetings.nyc , I don't manually review and fix all mistranscriptions and misdiarizations.

This happens with numbers and names of people/entities/locations in particular, and those numbers or entities might show up in the summary (e.g. someone said "70 million" but the transcript says "7 million"). Sometimes the errors are much worse, the mistranscription is offensive or entirely changes the meaning of what someone said.

My intent with summaries and reports is to faithfully represent things people have stated on the record in a way that is easy to skim.

top of page CHIP IN $20 TODAY TO HELP RE-ELECT RITA JOSEPH TO THE CITY COUNCIL MEET RITA MEET RITA ON THE ISSUES ON THE ISSUES More More   DONATE DONATE   After immigrating to the U.S. from Haiti as a child, Rita became civically engaged and began her life of advocacy. While growing up in Flatbush, Rita quickly recognized the power of activism. At just 19 years old, she organized her first rally with a group she co-founded, Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, in order to protest the FDA's discriminatory "bad blood" rules that prevented people of Haitian descent from donating blood. The rally succeeded in its mission, and the FDA rescinded the racist rule. Since organizing the rally, which had more than 150,000 people participate, Rita hasn't looked back with her community advocacy. As a teen mom who got a full college scholarship, Rita knows what it means to have to work for what you have. Rita spent her twenties raising two kids while organizing protests against cuts to student MetroCards and police brutality, on top of her full-time job. She organized not because it was easy, but because it was necessary for her community. Since then, she hasn’t stopped working for her neighbors. Rita has deep roots in the community she now represents as City Council Member of District 40. She is an active member of the Holy Innocent Catholic Church, served as Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Board, and was a part of the Citywide Participatory Budgeting Committee for 2 years. As an educator for many years at PS6, she was able to be a part of changing the lives of thousands of students and even helped her school secure hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for technological improvements. Rita currently serves as the Chair of the Committee on Education and also sits on committees related to public safety, civil and human rights, immigration, oversight and investigations, & children and youth. She is also a member of the Progressive Caucus, Women's Caucus, and Black, Latino, & Asian Caucus. Since joining the City Council in January 2022, Rita has been a part of many major accomplishments including in the most recent City budget, where as a member of the budget negotiating team, she was able to beat back proposed cuts to education, ensuring more than $600 million for our schools, including investments in early education enrollment, Pre-K, mental health, and afterschool programming. Rita Joseph is a proud public school graduate of the now-closed Sarah J. Hale High School. She holds a BS in Liberal Arts from St. Francis College and a dual Master’s in General and Special Education from Touro College. Rita currently lives in Prospect Lefferts Gardens where she raises her 4 children. bottom of page
