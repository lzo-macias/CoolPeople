    "text": "Edafe Okporo Welcome to the \"Speaking\" page of my website! As a gay asylum seeker, I understand the challenges of displacement, marginalization, and xenophobia that many people face in their pursuit of the American dream. However, I have since gone on to build a successful career in Human Resources, focusing on systems in the workplace and society at large. A REFUGEE JOURNEY OF FINDING HOME The Promise of America is that everyone has the opportunity to belong and build a life for themselves and future generations. But to actualize this vision, we must create a society where the most vulnerable among us have a sense of belonging. Through my work, I share the stories of refugees, asylum seekers, and displaced persons who have fled their homes in search of safety. I believe that we can create a society that is a bridge to all, where everyone has a sense of belonging, and a home is a place of joy. As a survivor of trauma, I know the importance of creating psychological safety in the workplace, especially for LGBTQ people, refugees, and minorities. I share tips on coming out in the workplace and creating an environment of inclusivity and acceptance. My ability to combine substance with storytelling has made me a sought-after guest speaker. For example, I was invited to speak at Grindr, where I helped increase their internal competency around app users in countries where homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia make it dangerous to be oneself. I look forward to finding additional ways to work with organizations in creating a more inclusive and equitable society. “ ” “ ” My interview on ABC News Keynote Speaker Request Form Thank you for considering me as a speaker for your event.
