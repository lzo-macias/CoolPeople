I know what people want.” Armstead, 45, who has experience doing criminal security work, said he would better equip the police force and seek to add tolls to bridges that lack them because he believes that would help deter people from smuggling in drugs and guns. Additionally, Armstead said he would work to institute a tax credit for renters. “(Landlords are) killing people’s pockets,” he said. “I’m fighting for our people to see a better life and better living. If we only see a little bit of it – as long as our children do – that’s the most important thing to me.” He credited de Blasio for repairing bricks and removing asbestos in public housing, but said more should be done. Armstead, who lives in public housing, said he would collaborate with New York City public housing residents to come up with ways to improve their communities. JOSH THOMPSON Josh Thompson, a 31-year-old protégé of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, boasts about standing up to his own party. He told Politico New York that he was proud of backing charter schools against fellow Democrats, and has been public about his support for school vouchers and merit pay for educators. Thompson, whose campaign did not respond to an interview request, credited a private school in Newark, New Jersey, with changing his life while growing up with a mother who struggled to make ends meet. That gave him the goal of ensuring all children have access to such quality education, according to Chalkbeat. While in school, Thompson met Booker and volunteered on his Newark mayoral campaign. Thompson went on to work in education roles for pro-charter, Democratic mayors in Washington, D.C., and Bridgeport, Connecticut, before becoming executive director of New Leaders New York, a nonprofit teacher development group, according to his campaign website. “While the mayor is raising money to get his own job back I’ve raised over $9 million for children (at New Leaders),” Thompson told Town & Village . “If you go to Bridgeport, you’ll see a balanced budget and every student has a tablet"
