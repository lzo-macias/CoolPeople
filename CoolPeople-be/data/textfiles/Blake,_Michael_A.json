This beginning probably explains his foundation of faith, politics and putting his heart and soul into all opportunities. When describing the path his life has taken, Michael Blake humbly refers to the words of his mother who remarked that the family had gone, “from no house to the White House.” Blake has committed himself to public service and to the empowerment of others like him, who may not have direct access to opportunities to participate in the policy and political debates that shape this nation. Blake’s family story is a testament to his achievement. His family emigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica seeking new opportunities, but facing many new challenges. Michael faced challenges in the quality of his education – his New York City elementary school, P.S. 79, is featured in Jonathan Kozol’s Savage Inequalities: Children in America’s Schools yet still rose to graduate from Northwestern University – making his story all the more remarkable. Blake currently is the National Senior Consultant for Green For All, the leading voice for green jobs for communities of color, while also doing governmental, political and constituency outreach consulting.

Michael Blake bets on affordability pitch to revive NYC Mayoral campaign By Adam Daly Posted on May 2, 2025 Michael Blake joined the race for mayor last November, he’s hoping to pick up momentum in these last two months before the primary Photo courtesy of BlakeForNYC NYC mayoral candidate Michael Blake renewed his call for a rent freeze for stabilized units across the five boroughs, following the New York City Rent Guidelines Board’s preliminary vote on Wednesday to raise rents by up to 7.75%. Blake told amNewYork he sees it as a necessary step to address the affordability crisis, while pledging aid for small property owners through targeted revenue streams like a vacancy tax. “We can find ways to ensure that our small property owners are getting the support they need, whether it be through the vacant apartment tax or vacant commercial residential tax, or be taking some funding from reserves,” he said of the key issue raised by sitting Mayor Eric Adams who has not backed a rent"

Email Sign Up The Small Property Owners of New York criticized the RGB’s preliminary rent hikes Thursday, saying they ought to be higher to keep up with rising expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. RGB cited data shows that landlord operating costs for rent-stabilized buildings rose by 6.3% over the past year. “We have to find ways that we’re helping New Yorkers with one of the two main expenses that they’re dealing with, housing and childcare, which is what is holding people back. And we can’t keep ignoring that,” said Blake. With less than two months until the crowded Democratic mayoral primary, Michael Blake says he’s banking on late-deciding voters and a detailed policy agenda to propel his campaign past better-known rivals, including former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani who are running away in the polls. Based on the most recent mayoral polling, Blake, a former state Assembly member from the Bronx and Obama administration aide, has a lot of ground to make up. The last two polls found his support around 1-3% among registered Democratic voters. “A lot of this right now is based upon name recognition, you have one man and a former governor who is essentially 98% name recognition, and then you have a second who has had great organizing momentum, which you can’t ignore,” said Blake. “But at the end of the day, as there are debates and more forums and more opportunities to directly speak with voters, when people are paying attention, the choice that I’m laying out is that as the only person who has White House, State House and local experience as the only person who’s been a part of a team that defeated Donald Trump.” “How I’m laying out a plan around addressing cost of living and paying for it, I do believe that in less than two months, you can make that kind of move to be able to win,” he added. This run for mayor comes after stepping down from his Assembly seat to run for Congress, a race in which he came second to Rep. Ritchie Torres during the primary. He also placed 4th place in the Public Advocate special election of 2019. Reflecting on those failed election bids, Blake contends this one is different. “You have to find ways to give choice and contrast at the end when people are paying attention.” “Our job has to be not just telling people, I’m going to fight for you. It’s about explaining how you are helping them with this very specific issue around affordability,” he said. “And that’s what makes this one different. There’s tremendous fear that exists. During COVID, it was the fear of loss of life. Now it’s the fear of someone losing their job and their pension, and their benefits.” Hoping to catch up in the polls, Blake says his focus until primary day will be on direct voter engagement.

He proposes a guaranteed income program targeted at helping families struggling with housing and childcare, funded by the $2 billion in uncollected city fines , new taxes on vacant apartments and storefronts, and redirected city spending. Throughout the campaign, many of the candidates running to oust Mayor Adams have criticized Hizzoner for his relationship with President Donald Trump . Last month, the federal indictment against Adams was dismissed after Trump’s DOJ pushed for the case’s dismissal. Mayor Adams has long maintained that there was no quid-pro-quo between his legal team and the Trump administration and that he only acts in the best interests of New Yorkers. Blake said that if elected, he would confront the Trump administration with concrete legal and policy protections “that are currently not happening at all.” He said that every dollar the federal government cuts from services and programs in NYC, he would withhold NYC taxes sent to DC. “Dollar for dollar.” “You have to be very direct and clear about how you’re going to hold this man accountable, and we’re just not doing that,” he said. “When you check a bully, he stands down.” Blake said the city must be prepared for potential federal cuts by both generating new revenue and reallocating"

A cornerstone of Blake’s affordability agenda is a guaranteed income program aimed at supporting families burdened by housing and childcare costs. If elected, he plans to declare a “True Cost of Living Emergency” and roll out a pilot program in economically vulnerable neighborhoods, with a public dashboard to track outcomes and ensure transparency and accountability. Blake said to get the program off the ground, a True Cost of Living assessment will be carried out to calculate the real income a household needs to cover essential expenses like housing, food, childcare, and healthcare based on local costs and family size. The method is often touted as offering a more accurate alternative to federal poverty guidelines or Area Median Income. “You can then have an opportunity to understand what is the dollar gap that exists for New Yorkers who are in these communities around the true cost of living to help them with child care and housing,” he said. “And my assessment has been that you have to provide some level of guaranteed income to help families with those two expenses when someone is in need.” According to his campaign platform, an estimated 20,000 New Yorkers who are deemed eligible for the pilot program will receive $500 each towards housing and childcare expenses. On housing, Blake calls for a new “Mitchell-Lama 2.0” plan to expand middle-income housing on city lands and remove barriers like credit score requirements from rental and mortgage applications. “Doing that substantially gives a better chance for people to have an opportunity to pursue and keep their homes, and also to be able to get a chance,” he said. “If you pay your rent on time, that’s the best barometer of future history.

The method is often touted as offering a more accurate alternative to federal poverty guidelines or Area Median Income. “You can then have an opportunity to understand what is the dollar gap that exists for New Yorkers who are in these communities around the true cost of living to help them with child care and housing,” he said. “And my assessment has been that you have to provide some level of guaranteed income to help families with those two expenses when someone is in need.” According to his campaign platform, an estimated 20,000 New Yorkers who are deemed eligible for the pilot program will receive $500 each towards housing and childcare expenses. On housing, Blake calls for a new “Mitchell-Lama 2.0” plan to expand middle-income housing on city lands and remove barriers like credit score requirements from rental and mortgage applications. “Doing that substantially gives a better chance for people to have an opportunity to pursue and keep their homes, and also to be able to get a chance,” he said. “If you pay your rent on time, that’s the best barometer of future history. It’s not, ‘did you miss a cell phone bill? ’ In the final weeks of the campaign, Blake says his focus will be on direct voter engagement. “Every day, it’s about talking to more New Yorkers and reminding them: the people who had the chance to fix this city didn’t. Now it’s time to try something—and someone—new.” The Democratic primary is scheduled for June 25. About the Author Rent freeze and a comeback?

He’s worked as an aide for the Obama White House and represented the South Bronx in the state Assembly for six years.For his next political move, Blake believes he’s the best New Yorker to run City Hall. “Because I’m the best qualified, because I have a vision that could actually implement jobs and justice for the people,” Blake explained in an interview with NY1. For his first TV interview as a candidate for New York City mayor, Blake sat down with NY1 to discuss his campaign, saying he supports initiatives from universal childcare to tax credits to help keep businesses in the five boroughs. “Do we make sure New Yorkers have better jobs, better quality life, better living to be safe and secure and realize your dreams? And if you look at my entire track record, that’s all I’ve been committed to,” Blake said. Looking back at his time in Albany, Blake told NY1 he’s proud of the work he did to help get employees of state contractors paid faster, the establishment of the state’s My Brother’s Keeper Program to support young men of color and the passage of “Raise the Age.” “Sixteen and 17 year olds are not being tried as adults any longer, because we were adamant that had to change there,” he said. As a state assemblyman, Blake also became vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. He later ran unsuccessfully for public advocate and for a congressional seat in the South Bronx. Now, Blake believes his leadership is needed in the mayor’s office. “I’m a successful moderate who has implemented successful progressive policies, and people are looking for an option in the center,” he said.
