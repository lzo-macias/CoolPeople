My Story In 2019, I found myself at a crossroads. As a nurse leader working long hours in a demanding hospital setting, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and unhealthy. My sedentary lifestyle and poor habits led to weight gain and health complications, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart arrythmias. ​ ​ I realized I was merely existing, not living. My health struggles began to affect my work, leaving me unable to perform at my best for my team. It was then that I decided to take back control of my health and well-being. With the guidance of a personal health coach, I embraced a structured program that provided accountability, community, and the tools I needed to succeed. I lost 80 pounds, regained my energy and mental clarity, and transformed my life. This journey not only improved my health but reignited my passion for leadership and helping others achieve their own peak performance. ​ ​ Today, I am committed to helping healthcare leaders and their teams integrate wellness and leadership into their lives, empowering them to thrive in their roles and achieve their personal and professional goals.
