    "text": "0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu ABOUT ANTONIO Antonio Reynoso was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg as the son of two Dominican immigrants. He first entered public office as a City Council Member representing Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens. In 2021, Brooklynites elected him Borough President to bring bold, progressive leadership to Borough Hall. Antonio’s time as Borough President has been impactful. From housing, jobs, environmental justice, immigration services, and more, Antonio has transformed the office into a platform for real policy change and a hub for direct services. His administration has provided asylum work authorization application assistance, fought food insecurity, and delivered capital investments in community spaces, healthcare facilities, and nonprofit organizations that serve Brooklyn’s diverse communities. Antonio’s commitment to justice and equity is deeply personal. Growing up in a community overrun by processing 40% of the City’s trash, he saw firsthand the impact of environmental racism. As a Chair of the Council’s Sanitation Committee, he took on New York’s private sanitation industry, passing landmark legislation to cut pollution and improve labor conditions. As Borough President, he is continuing this fight by championing policies to improve air quality and public health across the borough. Antonio is also a fierce advocate for housing and tenant rights, taking New York’s affordability crisis head-on, pushing for new affordable housing across Brooklyn, opposing down zoning that restrict the creation of new homes, and championing policies like the City of Yes and ADU expansion. His Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn provides a roadmap for equitable development, ensuring every neighborhood contributes to - and benefits from - solving the city’s housing crisis. As a young father of two children in NYC public schools, including one with autism, Antonio understands the importance of investing in education, childcare, and family support systems. He has fought for increased special education services, expanded early intervention programs, and stronger protections for families navigating the school system. Throughout his career, Antonio has taken on tough battles—from fighting for more affordable housing across the entire borough to standing up against rollbacks on immigrant protections. He has never backed down from the fights that matter most to Brooklynites. Now, as he seeks re-election, Antonio remains committed to using every tool available to protect tenants, support working families, and make Brooklyn a place where everyone—regardless of background—has the opportunity to thrive.

Antonio’s commitment to justice and equity is deeply personal. Growing up in a community overrun by processing 40% of the City’s trash, he saw firsthand the impact of environmental racism. As a Chair of the Council’s Sanitation Committee, he took on New York’s private sanitation industry, passing landmark legislation to cut pollution and improve labor conditions. As Borough President, he is continuing this fight by championing policies to improve air quality and public health across the borough. Antonio is also a fierce advocate for housing and tenant rights, taking New York’s affordability crisis head-on, pushing for new affordable housing across Brooklyn, opposing down zoning that restrict the creation of new homes, and championing policies like the City of Yes and ADU expansion. His Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn provides a roadmap for equitable development, ensuring every neighborhood contributes to - and benefits from - solving the city’s housing crisis. As a young father of two children in NYC public schools, including one with autism, Antonio understands the importance of investing in education, childcare, and family support systems. He has fought for increased special education services, expanded early intervention programs, and stronger protections for families navigating the school system. Throughout his career, Antonio has taken on tough battles—from fighting for more affordable housing across the entire borough to standing up against rollbacks on immigrant protections. He has never backed down from the fights that matter most to Brooklynites."

The son of two Dominican immigrants, Antonio was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, just three blocks down from where he lives today with his wife and two sons. He grew up in Section 8 housing, relying on food stamps for family meals and scholarships for education opportunities. He experienced firsthand how a little help can go a long way for a young family trying their hardest to put down roots and have a fair shot at the life they want. In 2021, Antonio became the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. As Borough President, he made history when he allocated the entirety of his Fiscal Year 2023 capital budget – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals to build new and state-of-the-art maternal health facilities. This marked the first time a Borough President had ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. In Fall 2023, Antonio released The Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the first borough-specific, large-scale planning effort ever in NYC and a model for planning citywide. Antonio previously served as Council Member for the 34th Council District, representing portions of Bushwick and Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens. As a member of the City Council, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management. He led to passage the Commercial Waste Zones and Waste Equity bills, as well as the Right to Know Act. Antonio also championed the Bushwick Community Plan, a community-led rezoning to create affordable housing, preserve manufacturing space, and advance neighborhood needs that the de Blasio administration ultimately blocked from advancing. Get to Know Antonio The Kid Antonio Reynoso was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, where he lived with his parents – both immigrants from the Dominican Republic – and two sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. Their home was always full of laughter and family. Every Sunday, first thing in the morning, his aunts and uncles were banging on the door to play dominoes. It was the best part of his week. The Student Antonio’s parents immigrated to the United States in the late ‘70s and began to build a new life in Williamsburg just as the NYC 1980s Crack Epidemic was coming to a fever pitch. His mother along with his aunts came together to discuss how they’d ensure their kids were safe and set on a path to success. The decision was swift and unanimous: they would put everything they had into getting their children the best educations possible. The Organizer After graduating Le Moyne College with his B.A. in political science, Antonio began working for ACORN under the leadership of legendary organizers Jon Kest and Bertha Lewis, helping to unionize childcare workers who had been left out of the salary, pensions, or healthcare opportunities they deserved. The Council Member Antonio represented Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens as District 34’s Council Member from 2014 until 2022. Over his two terms, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management; led to passage landmark bills such as the Waste Equity Law, Commercial Waste Zone Legislation, and the Right to Know Act; and developed the Bushwick Community Plan.

The son of two Dominican immigrants, Antonio was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, just three blocks down from where he lives today with his wife and two sons. He grew up in Section 8 housing, relying on food stamps for family meals and scholarships for education opportunities. He experienced firsthand how a little help can go a long way for a young family trying their hardest to put down roots and have a fair shot at the life they want. In 2021, Antonio became the youngest Borough President elected to a four-year term, the first Latino to hold the office in the borough, and the first Dominican to be elected as a Borough President in NYC. As Borough President, he made history when he allocated the entirety of his Fiscal Year 2023 capital budget – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals to build new and state-of-the-art maternal health facilities. This marked the first time a Borough President had ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. In Fall 2023, Antonio released The Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the first borough-specific, large-scale planning effort ever in NYC and a model for planning citywide. Antonio previously served as Council Member for the 34th Council District, representing portions of Bushwick and Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens. As a member of the City Council, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management. He led to passage the Commercial Waste Zones and Waste Equity bills, as well as the Right to Know Act. Antonio also championed the Bushwick Community Plan, a community-led rezoning to create affordable housing, preserve manufacturing space, and advance neighborhood needs that the de Blasio administration ultimately blocked from advancing. Get to Know Antonio The Kid Antonio Reynoso was born and raised in Los Sures, Williamsburg, where he lived with his parents – both immigrants from the Dominican Republic – and two sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. Their home was always full of laughter and family. Every Sunday, first thing in the morning, his aunts and uncles were banging on the door to play dominoes. It was the best part of his week. The Student Antonio’s parents immigrated to the United States in the late ‘70s and began to build a new life in Williamsburg just as the NYC 1980s Crack Epidemic was coming to a fever pitch. His mother along with his aunts came together to discuss how they’d ensure their kids were safe and set on a path to success. The decision was swift and unanimous: they would put everything they had into getting their children the best educations possible. The Organizer After graduating Le Moyne College with his B.A. in political science, Antonio began working for ACORN under the leadership of legendary organizers Jon Kest and Bertha Lewis, helping to unionize childcare workers who had been left out of the salary, pensions, or healthcare opportunities they deserved. The Council Member Antonio represented Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn and Ridgewood in Queens as District 34’s Council Member from 2014 until 2022. Over his two terms, he served as the Chair of Sanitation & Solid Waste Management; led to passage landmark bills such as the Waste Equity Law, Commercial Waste Zone Legislation, and the Right to Know Act; and developed the Bushwick Community Plan.

The Plan identifies patterns across Brooklyn and shows us what each neighborhood needs and what each neighborhood can give to ensure all New Yorkers are healthy, housed, and supported. For example, while one community district in Brooklyn created 12,000 new units of affordable housing over a ten-year span, another added only 7.

Safe and Joyful Pregnancies for Brooklyn Moms After taking office, BP Reynoso set his sights on addressing the maternal health crisis devastating new families in Brooklyn. He vowed to do what he could to close the disparities leading to Black women being 8 times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than their white counterparts. In his first year as Borough President, he allocated the entirety of his Fiscal Year 2023 capital budget – a total of $45 million – to Brooklyn’s three public hospitals to create new and state-of-the-art maternal health facilities. This marked the first time a Borough President has ever allocated an entire fiscal year’s capital funding to one cause, and within one city organization. A Plan for a Healthy and Housed Brooklyn In his second year as Borough President, Antonio released his Comprehensive Plan for Brooklyn, the first borough-specific, large-scale planning effort ever in NYC and a model for planning citywide. The Plan identifies patterns across Brooklyn and shows us what each neighborhood needs and what each neighborhood can give to ensure all New Yorkers are healthy, housed, and supported. For example, while one community district in Brooklyn created 12,000 new units of affordable housing over a ten-year span, another added only 7. A Pivot to Celebrating Through Service As New Yorkers began to face more and more struggles in their everyday life, BP Reynoso decided to do something unprecedented: pivot away from the cultural celebrations famous of Borough Presidents’ past and rededicate the office’s resources toward celebrating Brooklyn through service . He’s hosted deed theft prevention workshops, NYC Rent Freeze Program enrollment clinics, shelter animal adoption drives, one-on-one consultations to help homeowners get their DOB summonses corrected, and more. He even converted the Community Room at Borough Hall, a place once known for parties and food, into a satellite Asylum Application Help Center to help undocumented immigrants apply for work authorization. Since its start in March 2024, the site has completed over 5,000 work authorizations. Watch Borough President Antonio Reynoso’s 2022 inauguration.
