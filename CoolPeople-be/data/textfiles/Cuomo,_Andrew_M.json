    "text": "served as the governor of New York from 2011 to 2021, when he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations . He previously served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD; 1997–2001) under Pres. Bill Clinton and as New York’s attorney general (2007–10). In 2025 Cuomo announced that he was running for mayor of New York City . Early life and education As a teenager in Queens , New York, Cuomo put up posters to help his father, Democrat Mario Cuomo , campaign for state office. Andrew Cuomo graduated from Fordham University in 1979, the year in which his father became New York lieutenant governor. After graduating from Albany Law School (J.D., 1982), he ran the campaign that made his father governor (1983–95). For the next two years Andrew Cuomo worked as his father’s senior adviser in Albany. From assistant district attorney to secretary of HUD In 1984 Cuomo moved to New York City, where he became an assistant district attorney and a partner in the law firm of Blutrich, Falcone & Miller. During this time, he began to focus on the problems of the city’s homeless population, and in 1986 he founded Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged (HELP), an organization that provided transitional housing for people living on the streets. He continued to advise his father from a distance and managed his successful 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign. Cuomo’s efforts for the homeless led to his appointment in 1991 to chair the New York City Commission on the Homeless. After Clinton’s election as president in November 1992, Cuomo went to Washington, D.C., to help with the transition to the new administration and stayed to work on housing at the federal level. In May 1993 the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment to HUD as assistant secretary for Community Planning and Development. Working closely with Vice Pres. Al Gore , Cuomo introduced new government policies to move the homeless into permanent housing with the help of transitional housing and expanded social services. In December 1996 President Clinton nominated Cuomo to become secretary of HUD, a post that he held from 1997 to 2001. Governor of New York Policies and COVID After losing his first New York gubernatorial bid in 2002, Cuomo won election as the state’s attorney general in 2006. He ran again for governor in 2010 and this time was successful in winning the office, handily defeating his Republican opponent, businessman Carl Paladino, in the general election. Cuomo was reelected to a second term in 2014. As governor of New York, he signed legislation in 2011 that legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In late 2014 he announced a ban on fracking , or hydraulic fracturing, citing a state-funded health study that found “significant public health risks” associated with the practice. He also oversaw tax cuts and an increase to the minimum wage . Cuomo faced controversy in 2014 when he abruptly closed a commission he had created the previous year to root out government corruption. Amid allegations that his administration had interfered with the panel, federal authorities conducted an investigation, and in 2016 it was announced that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In March 2020 New York City became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States , and Cuomo gained a national profile with his press briefings, in which he often criticized Pres. Donald Trump ’s response to the crisis. The governor’s popularity rose as many praised his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and he released American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020). However, he was not without his critics, some of whom accused him of causing unnecessary deaths among nursing-home patients, a population especially hard-hit by COVID-19. Drawing particular criticism was a controversial state policy in which people infected with the virus were sent to nursing homes. Cuomo defended the plan, but in 2021 it was revealed that his administration had undercounted nursing-home deaths. The matter became the subject of an FBI investigation. Sexual misconduct allegations and resignation Another scandal emerged in late 2020 when a series of women began accusing Cuomo of sexual harassment . In addition, there were allegations that he created a toxic workplace. Cuomo denied the claims, and he defended his physical gestures as a way of “convey[ing] warmth, nothing more.” However, the state’s attorney general subsequently launched an investigation.

During this time, he began to focus on the problems of the city’s homeless population, and in 1986 he founded Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged (HELP), an organization that provided transitional housing for people living on the streets. He continued to advise his father from a distance and managed his successful 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign. Cuomo’s efforts for the homeless led to his appointment in 1991 to chair the New York City Commission on the Homeless. After Clinton’s election as president in November 1992, Cuomo went to Washington, D.C., to help with the transition to the new administration and stayed to work on housing at the federal level. In May 1993 the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment to HUD as assistant secretary for Community Planning and Development. Working closely with Vice Pres. Al Gore , Cuomo introduced new government policies to move the homeless into permanent housing with the help of transitional housing and expanded social services. In December 1996 President Clinton nominated Cuomo to become secretary of HUD, a post that he held from 1997 to 2001. Governor of New York Policies and COVID After losing his first New York gubernatorial bid in 2002, Cuomo won election as the state’s attorney general in 2006. He ran again for governor in 2010 and this time was successful in winning the office, handily defeating his Republican opponent, businessman Carl Paladino, in the general election. Cuomo was reelected to a second term in 2014. As governor of New York, he signed legislation in 2011 that legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In late 2014 he announced a ban on fracking , or hydraulic fracturing, citing a state-funded health study that found “significant public health risks” associated with the practice. He also oversaw tax cuts and an increase to the minimum wage . Cuomo faced controversy in 2014 when he abruptly closed a commission he had created the previous year to root out government corruption. Amid allegations that his administration had interfered with the panel, federal authorities conducted an investigation, and in 2016 it was announced that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In March 2020 New York City became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States , and Cuomo gained a national profile with his press briefings, in which he often criticized Pres. Donald Trump ’s response to the crisis. The governor’s popularity rose as many praised his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and he released American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020). However, he was not without his critics, some of whom accused him of causing unnecessary deaths among nursing-home patients, a population especially hard-hit by COVID-19. Drawing particular criticism was a controversial state policy in which people infected with the virus were sent to nursing homes. Cuomo defended the plan, but in 2021 it was revealed that his administration had undercounted nursing-home deaths. The matter became the subject of an FBI investigation. Sexual misconduct allegations and resignation Another scandal emerged in late 2020 when a series of women began accusing Cuomo of sexual harassment . In addition, there were allegations that he created a toxic workplace. Cuomo denied the claims, and he defended his physical gestures as a way of “convey[ing] warmth, nothing more.” However, the state’s attorney general subsequently launched an investigation. The final report was released in August 2021, and Cuomo was found to have sexually harassed numerous women “through unwelcome and unwanted touching, as well as by making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive comments.” It also determined that his administration’s response to the accusations had contributed to “an overall hostile work environment.” Cuomo again denied any wrongdoing and accused the report of being biased .

During this time, he began to focus on the problems of the city’s homeless population, and in 1986 he founded Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged (HELP), an organization that provided transitional housing for people living on the streets. He continued to advise his father from a distance and managed his successful 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign. Cuomo’s efforts for the homeless led to his appointment in 1991 to chair the New York City Commission on the Homeless. After Clinton’s election as president in November 1992, Cuomo went to Washington, D.C., to help with the transition to the new administration and stayed to work on housing at the federal level. In May 1993 the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment to HUD as assistant secretary for Community Planning and Development. Working closely with Vice Pres. Al Gore , Cuomo introduced new government policies to move the homeless into permanent housing with the help of transitional housing and expanded social services. In December 1996 President Clinton nominated Cuomo to become secretary of HUD, a post that he held from 1997 to 2001. Governor of New York Policies and COVID After losing his first New York gubernatorial bid in 2002, Cuomo won election as the state’s attorney general in 2006. He ran again for governor in 2010 and this time was successful in winning the office, handily defeating his Republican opponent, businessman Carl Paladino, in the general election. Cuomo was reelected to a second term in 2014. As governor of New York, he signed legislation in 2011 that legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In late 2014 he announced a ban on fracking , or hydraulic fracturing, citing a state-funded health study that found “significant public health risks” associated with the practice. He also oversaw tax cuts and an increase to the minimum wage . Cuomo faced controversy in 2014 when he abruptly closed a commission he had created the previous year to root out government corruption. Amid allegations that his administration had interfered with the panel, federal authorities conducted an investigation, and in 2016 it was announced that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In March 2020 New York City became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States , and Cuomo gained a national profile with his press briefings, in which he often criticized Pres. Donald Trump ’s response to the crisis. The governor’s popularity rose as many praised his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and he released American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020). However, he was not without his critics, some of whom accused him of causing unnecessary deaths among nursing-home patients, a population especially hard-hit by COVID-19. Drawing particular criticism was a controversial state policy in which people infected with the virus were sent to nursing homes. Cuomo defended the plan, but in 2021 it was revealed that his administration had undercounted nursing-home deaths. The matter became the subject of an FBI investigation. Sexual misconduct allegations and resignation Another scandal emerged in late 2020 when a series of women began accusing Cuomo of sexual harassment . In addition, there were allegations that he created a toxic workplace. Cuomo denied the claims, and he defended his physical gestures as a way of “convey[ing] warmth, nothing more.” However, the state’s attorney general subsequently launched an investigation. The final report was released in August 2021, and Cuomo was found to have sexually harassed numerous women “through unwelcome and unwanted touching, as well as by making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive comments.” It also determined that his administration’s response to the accusations had contributed to “an overall hostile work environment.” Cuomo again denied any wrongdoing and accused the report of being biased . Calls for his resignation increased, including within his own party; notably, U.S. Pres. Joe Biden said that he should step down. Facing likely impeachment , Cuomo on August 10 announced his resignation, effective in two weeks. He left office on August 24 and was succeeded by Lieut. Gov. Kathy Hochul , who became New York’s first female governor. The scandal also ensnared his brother, Chris Cuomo, a TV journalist with CNN . Chris Cuomo offered strategic advice, and once that became public in late 2021, CNN fired him. Return to politics In 2023 there was speculation that Andrew Cuomo would be a candidate in the following year’s Senate race, trying to unseat Kirsten Gillibrand , a Democrat. Cuomo ultimately did not run, but in 2025 he officially entered New York City’s mayoral"

    "text": "similarities to ones already put forward by the Adams administration over the last three years. “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” an Adams’ administration source told The Post after Cuomo’s plan dropped. “Especially when it comes to cleaning up situations created by the imitator.” “This is yet another example of Andrew Cuomo pulling multiple pages from Mayor Adams’ book to create ‘plans,’ and it stands in stark contrast to the former governor’s record having reduced funding and the number of psychiatric beds while in office,” added press secretary Kayla Mamelak. One of Cuomo’s main focuses would be removing those who are a danger to themselves from the streets, according to his 36-page proposal . 5 A homeless person sleeps on a subway train on Monday, December 30, 2024 in New York City. Michael Nagle As part of the plan, Cuomo has vowed to expand the use of court orders under Kendra’s Law — mainly by requiring “universal screening” when people are discharged from public hospitals and from Rikers Island jail. Adams, for his part, has long called for the state law to be strengthened so the city can commit people suffering from severe mental illness for longer. 5 Former Governor Andrew Cuomo (pictured) visited two churches today as part of his comback tour in the City of New York on May 4, 2025. Gregory P. Mango Cuomo also highlighted how the city needs to tap into involuntarily removing homeless people from the streets who can’t meet their basic needs — a policy expansion that was put in place nearly three years ago under the Adams administration following a spate of horrifying subway attacks. As governor, Cuomo had also tried to make it easier to take the mentally ill off the streets and into treatment against their will, but was slapped down by the state legislature. Jason Elan, a spokesman for Cuomo, brushed off accusations that the former governor cribbed from Adams’ policies. “Andrew Cuomo pioneered many of these policies during his time as HUD Secretary and while working as Governor,” Elan said in a statement. “While it’s nice that Eric Adams has paid lip service to many of the programs initiated by Governor Cuomo, the sad reality is his execution has been wholly ineffective, which is why the problem of mentally ill homelessness in the city has not only not improved, but gotten worse during his tenure.” City comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was quick to rip Cuomo’s agenda – arguing he deserves the blame for a worsening crisis given he cut psychiatric beds while governor. “Andrew Cuomo releasing a plan to fix our mental health crisis is like an arsonist saying he’ll put out a fire,” Lander said. “Everyone knows that when Andrew Cuomo was governor, he deliberately gutted our mental health services, slashing thousands of beds, which helped cause the dire situation on our streets and subways that afflicts New York to this day.” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi countered that the former governor only axed beds that were not being used and didn’t touch those to treat violent, mentally ill people going through the court system. “Eleven years ago, we redirected funding for 183 perenally [sic] vacant inpatient beds for non-violent mentally ill people and redirected it to fund supportive services that have served 200,000 New Yorkers who otherwise would have had to fight for limited resources,” Azzopardi said in a statement. Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa piled on Cuomo’s record. “Andrew Cuomo is once again pretending to be a firefighter rushing to a fire he started. The public safety and homelessness crisis we’re dealing with today is a direct result of his failed leadership as governor,” the Guardian Angels founder sniped. “While I ride the subways and face it head-on, he ran off to the Hamptons — and now he wants to be mayor and thinks New Yorkers are stupid enough to forget.” Other parts of Cuomo’s blueprint to tackle the mental health crisis include $2.6 billion to expand congregate supportive housing, fill essential workforce shortages and establish a cross-agency team to coordinate outreach to the homeless population. “The mental health and homelessness crisis in New York City is a humanitarian emergency hiding in plain sight. We see it every day — in our overflowing shelters, our streets, our subways,” Cuomo said. “As Mayor, I will rebuild a system that doesn’t just manage dysfunction — it delivers results. We will get people the treatment, housing, and care they need, and restore both dignity and safety"

Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa piled on Cuomo’s record. “Andrew Cuomo is once again pretending to be a firefighter rushing to a fire he started. The public safety and homelessness crisis we’re dealing with today is a direct result of his failed leadership as governor,” the Guardian Angels founder sniped. “While I ride the subways and face it head-on, he ran off to the Hamptons — and now he wants to be mayor and thinks New Yorkers are stupid enough to forget.” Other parts of Cuomo’s blueprint to tackle the mental health crisis include $2.6 billion to expand congregate supportive housing, fill essential workforce shortages and establish a cross-agency team to coordinate outreach to the homeless population. “The mental health and homelessness crisis in New York City is a humanitarian emergency hiding in plain sight. We see it every day — in our overflowing shelters, our streets, our subways,” Cuomo said. “As Mayor, I will rebuild a system that doesn’t just manage dysfunction — it delivers results. We will get people the treatment, housing, and care they need, and restore both dignity and safety"

Andrew Cuomo unveiled his plan Tuesday to fix the Big Apple’s mental health crisis — by walking back policies he executed while in office, and oddly copycatting those of Mayor Eric Adams. At least 12 of 14 points in Cuomo’s proposal mirror ideas that his mayoral rival Adams has already pushed to help get people with severe mental illness off the streets, including expanding involuntary hospitalizations and boosting psychiatric beds. The striking similarities to plans that Adams spent three years advocating for didn’t go unnoticed by bemused City Hall officials. “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” an Adams’ administration source told The Post after Cuomo’s plan dropped. “Especially when it comes to cleaning up situations created by the imitator.” “This is yet another example of Andrew Cuomo pulling multiple pages from Mayor Adams’ book to create ‘plans,’ and it stands in stark contrast to the former governor’s record having reduced funding and the number of psychiatric beds while in office,” added press secretary Kayla Mamelak. 5 5 5 Helayne Seidman Explore More College student faces deportation after running red light — police discover her family's been living illegally in US for years FBI opens formal criminal probe into New York AG Letitia James over alleged mortgage fraud Biden reveals on 'The View' he ‘wasn't surprised’ Trump defeated Harris in 2024 election Critics have long blamed many of Cuomo’s policies as governor for the city’s intertwined mental health and homelessness crises.

    "text": "redirected for COVID, but only 200 returned as the pandemic cooled. 5 5 5 Gregory P. Mango But now Cuomo — who resigned in 2021 and is making a comeback bid to unseat Adams as New York City’s mayor — is calling for between 100 and 200 new inpatient psychiatric beds to be added in the city’s Health and Hospitals system in a bid to keep mentally ill perps out of Rikers. The additional inpatient beds are up from the 100-odd new beds Hizzoner touted during his State of the City speech earlier this year to tackle the crisis. The former governor also floated boosting supportive housing units from 500 to 1,600 per year — up from the 900 “Safe Haven” beds promised by Adams to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing. 5 5 5 James Messerschmidt Many of the key elements in Cuomo’s plan bear striking similarities to ones already put forward by the Adams administration over the last three years. “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” an Adams’ administration source told The Post after Cuomo’s plan dropped. “Especially when it comes to cleaning up situations created by the imitator.” “This is yet another example of Andrew Cuomo pulling multiple pages from Mayor Adams’ book to create ‘plans,’ and it stands in stark contrast to the former governor’s record having reduced funding and the number of psychiatric beds while in office,” added press secretary Kayla Mamelak. One of Cuomo’s main focuses would be removing those who are a danger to themselves from the streets, according to his 36-page proposal . 5 5 5 Michael Nagle As part of the plan, Cuomo has vowed to expand the use of court orders under Kendra’s Law — mainly by requiring “universal screening” when people are discharged from public hospitals and from Rikers Island jail. Adams, for his part, has long called for the state law to be strengthened so the city can commit people suffering from severe mental illness for longer. 5 5 5 Gregory P. Mango Cuomo also highlighted how the city needs to tap into involuntarily removing homeless people from the streets who can’t meet their basic needs — a policy expansion that was put in place nearly three years ago under the Adams administration following a spate of horrifying subway attacks. As governor, Cuomo had also tried to make it easier to take the mentally ill off the streets and into treatment against their will, but was slapped down by the state legislature. Jason Elan, a spokesman for Cuomo, brushed off accusations that the former governor cribbed from Adams’ policies. “Andrew Cuomo pioneered many of these policies during his time as HUD Secretary and while working as Governor,” Elan said in a statement. “While it’s nice that Eric Adams has paid lip service to many of the programs initiated by Governor Cuomo, the sad reality is his execution has been wholly ineffective, which is why the problem of mentally ill homelessness in the city has not only not improved, but gotten worse during his tenure.” City comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was quick to rip Cuomo’s agenda – arguing he deserves the blame for a worsening crisis given he cut psychiatric beds while governor. “Andrew Cuomo releasing a plan to fix our mental health crisis is like an arsonist saying he’ll put out a fire,” Lander said. “Everyone knows that when Andrew Cuomo was governor, he deliberately gutted our mental health services, slashing thousands of beds, which helped cause the dire situation on our streets and subways that afflicts New York to this day.” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi countered that the former governor only axed beds that were not being used and didn’t touch those to treat violent, mentally ill people going through the court system. “Eleven years ago, we redirected funding for 183 perenally [sic] vacant inpatient beds for non-violent mentally ill people and redirected it to fund supportive services that have served 200,000 New Yorkers who otherwise would have had to fight for limited resources,” Azzopardi said in a statement. Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa piled on Cuomo’s record. “Andrew Cuomo is once again pretending to be a firefighter rushing to a fire he started. The public safety and homelessness crisis we’re dealing with today is a direct result of his failed leadership as governor,” the Guardian Angels founder sniped. “While I ride the subways and face it head-on, he ran off to the Hamptons — and now he wants to be"

Mango But now Cuomo — who resigned in 2021 and is making a comeback bid to unseat Adams as New York City’s mayor — is calling for between 100 and 200 new inpatient psychiatric beds to be added in the city’s Health and Hospitals system in a bid to keep mentally ill perps out of Rikers. The additional inpatient beds are up from the 100-odd new beds Hizzoner touted during his State of the City speech earlier this year to tackle the crisis. The former governor also floated boosting supportive housing units from 500 to 1,600 per year — up from the 900 “Safe Haven” beds promised by Adams to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing. 5 5 5 James Messerschmidt Many of the key elements in Cuomo’s plan bear striking similarities to ones already put forward by the Adams administration over the last three years. “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” an Adams’ administration source told The Post after Cuomo’s plan dropped. “Especially when it comes to cleaning up situations created by the imitator.” “This is yet another example of Andrew Cuomo pulling multiple pages from Mayor Adams’ book to create ‘plans,’ and it stands in stark contrast to the former governor’s record having reduced funding and the number of psychiatric beds while in office,” added press secretary Kayla Mamelak. One of Cuomo’s main focuses would be removing those who are a danger to themselves from the streets, according to his 36-page proposal . 5 5 5 Michael Nagle As part of the plan, Cuomo has vowed to expand the use of court orders under Kendra’s Law — mainly by requiring “universal screening” when people are discharged from public hospitals and from Rikers Island jail. Adams, for his part, has long called for the state law to be strengthened so the city can commit people suffering from severe mental illness for longer. 5 5 5 Gregory P. Mango Cuomo also highlighted how the city needs to tap into involuntarily removing homeless people from the streets who can’t meet their basic needs — a policy expansion that was put in place nearly three years ago under the Adams administration following a spate of horrifying subway attacks. As governor, Cuomo had also tried to make it easier to take the mentally ill off the streets and into treatment against their will, but was slapped down by the state legislature. Jason Elan, a spokesman for Cuomo, brushed off accusations that the former governor cribbed from Adams’ policies. “Andrew Cuomo pioneered many of these policies during his time as HUD Secretary and while working as Governor,” Elan said in a statement. “While it’s nice that Eric Adams has paid lip service to many of the programs initiated by Governor Cuomo, the sad reality is his execution has been wholly ineffective, which is why the problem of mentally ill homelessness in the city has not only not improved, but gotten worse during his tenure.” City comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was quick to rip Cuomo’s agenda – arguing he deserves the blame for a worsening crisis given he cut psychiatric beds while governor. “Andrew Cuomo releasing a plan to fix our mental health crisis is like an arsonist saying he’ll put out a fire,” Lander said. “Everyone knows that when Andrew Cuomo was governor, he deliberately gutted our mental health services, slashing thousands of beds, which helped cause the dire situation on our streets and subways that afflicts New York to this day.” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi countered that the former governor only axed beds that were not being used and didn’t touch those to treat violent, mentally ill people going through the court system. “Eleven years ago, we redirected funding for 183 perenally [sic] vacant inpatient beds for non-violent mentally ill people and redirected it to fund supportive services that have served 200,000 New Yorkers who otherwise would have had to fight for limited resources,” Azzopardi said in a statement. Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa piled on Cuomo’s record. “Andrew Cuomo is once again pretending to be a firefighter rushing to a fire he started. The public safety and homelessness crisis we’re dealing with today is a direct result of his failed leadership as governor,” the Guardian Angels founder sniped. “While I ride the subways and face it head-on, he ran off to the Hamptons — and now he wants to be"

That day came Saturday, when the Democrat announced he was running for mayor of New York City. Democrat announced Now, the big question is whether voters want him back. In his campaign announcement video Saturday and a speech Sunday, Cuomo sought to portray New York as a city in crisis. He cast himself as a tough manager who can tackle problems like homelessness and sky-high housing costs. Yet his entry into the race prompted immediate condemnation from some who said he doesn’t deserve a second chance. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s run for Mayor. Here’s a look at how we got here: Why Cuomo resigned Cuomo quit the governor’s office in August 2021 when it looked certain he would be impeached. A report commissioned by the state’s attorney general concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women. Some had complained about unwanted touches, flirting, kisses and suggestive comments about their sex lives or appearance. One aide filed a criminal complaint, saying Cuomo groped her breast. The Albany district attorney declined to prosecute, saying there wasn’t enough proof. Arizona’s Democratic governor faces uphill battle as Republicans control Legislature Biden says he’s leaving Trump with a ‘strong hand to play’ in world conflicts West Virginia’s conservative shift could sharpen under its new governor Many top Democrats pushed Cuomo to quit, including then-President Joe Biden, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the state’s two U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. Cuomo apologized for some of his conduct, saying he didn’t realize it made people uncomfortable, but he denied the most serious allegations, particularly the alleged sexual assault. What do Cuomo’s accusers think of his comeback? The first woman to publicly accuse Cuomo of harassment, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an essay in Vanity Fair that letting him return to public office would be a mistake. essay in Vanity Fair He has not changed, she wrote, citing among other things a “scorched earth” campaign to blacken the reputations of his accusers. “Although some pundits have been insisting that enough time has passed — and that certain men who have fallen from power should be allowed to regain it — that stance is misguided because men like Cuomo never really lose power,” she wrote. “They maintain their positions because people who are very powerful themselves are still afraid of them — a dynamic that speaks to our political moment.” What does Cuomo say? In his initial public remarks, he only addressed the sexual harassment matter indirectly. “Did I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show that every day,” he said in his announcement video. “But I promise you this: I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it, and I will give it my all to get the job done — and it will get done.” Previously, he has blamed “cancel culture” for his ouster. What did he get done as governor? Cuomo pushed through legalization of same-sex marriage in New York in 2011. His administration overhauled terminals at LaGuardia Airport, created a new train hall at Pennsylvania Station and replaced a key Hudson River crossing, the Tappan Zee bridge. He signed laws that raised the minimum wage to $15, instituted paid family leave for workers and oversaw rebuilding programs after Hurricane Sandy caused catastrophic damage on the state’s coast. The Democrat’s administration also created an economic revitalization program that poured $1 billion into the Buffalo metropolitan area, including deep subsidies to a factory now operated by Tesla. That program wound up spawning a corruption scandal that led to several Cuomo allies and one of his closest political advisers getting indicted, though the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately overturned they key convictions . overturned they key convictions What about COVID-19? Cuomo gained national prominence when the pandemic began killing thousands of people in New York in 2020. His daily briefings on the pandemic were watched by Americans far beyond New York. He imposed some of the nation’s strictest social-distancing rules and shutdowns and"

The administration substantially understated deaths in nursing homes as part of an effort to deflect criticism of a policy, early in the pandemic, that barred the homes from refusing to readmit COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals. It remains unclear whether that short-lived policy had an impact on deaths. Why come back now? Cuomo has a unique opportunity in New York City’s mayoral contest. The incumbent mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, was indicted on federal corruption charges last year. Prosecutors said Adams accepted free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from people trying to gain his influence. Adams’ political problems only got deeper after the new leaders of the U.S. Justice Department instructed prosecutors to drop the case so that Adams could assist in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. That’s led to suspicion that Adams is too beholden to Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in the city. A judge is weighing what to do with the criminal case. Most of the rest of the candidates in the primary are well to the political left of Adams and Cuomo. Unless another big-name moderate candidate emerges, that might leave voters having to pick between liberals whose views they might not share and two scandal-scarred Democratic heavyweights. Cuomo is betting he’ll come out on top.

Cuomo has portrayed New York City as being in crisis mode and has said that his top priority if elected would be keeping people safe. To do so, Mr. Cuomo, the former governor of New York, says the city must do more to remove people with severe mental illness from the streets and ease fears over high-profile attacks involving homeless people. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo will release a detailed 36-page plan about how he would do that, including expanding involuntary hospitalizations and requiring people who are discharged from public hospitals and jails to be screened for mandatory outpatient treatment. The plan includes more than a dozen proposals to address what he calls the city’s “mental health crisis.” Mr. Cuomo will call for adding more supportive housing units and psychiatric beds at hospitals and improving access to preventative mental health services. His main focus is on removing people who are a danger to themselves and the public. “You don’t want to institutionalize a person involuntarily unless you have to,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. “But when you have to, you should for the person’s own benefit, and that’s what we haven’t been doing.” Many of Mr. Cuomo’s ideas are similar to those proposed by Mayor Eric Adams, who has struggled to confront concerns over public safety .

But will candidates’ expected big spending on TV advertising in the coming weeks be enough to shake things up? Here’s where the 2025 NYC Mayor’s race stands right now.

Sign Up The former governor has by far gained the most support from institutional pols, such as Brooklyn and Queens Democratic Party Chairs Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn and Gregory Meeks, respectively, and labor unions, including 32BJ SEIU and 1199SEIU. He has raked in over $1.5 million in private donations and is buoyed by millions more raised by a super PAC backing his run, though the city Campaign Finance Board (CFB) denied him a crucial tranche of matching funds last month. In a Friday interview on Pix11 , Cuomo reiterated his central campaign message that he jumped into the race because the city is “in crisis” and he believes he can fix it. “We’re in a bad place, and I’m a New York City boy, through and through. I love this city,” Cuomo said. “I was worried that we are at a pivot point, and if we don’t get our act together quickly, you’re gonna see this city decline. And I just couldn’t sit by and let that happen.” Mamdani emerging as main alternative Queens Assembly Member and mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaking at a rally in City Hall Park against front-runner Andrew Cuomo’s record on housing. Friday, April 18, 2025. Photo by Lloyd Mitchell The Democratic socialist Mamdani has seen his campaign continue to rise in the polls . He consistently places second behind Cuomo while still trailing the former governor by double digits. Nevertheless, Mamdani’s straightforward platform appears to be resonating with many voters, which is evident in his status as the strongest fundraiser in the race. . He consistently places second behind Cuomo “We have built a movement that transcends race and class, a movement that reaches from the sandy beaches of Coney Island to the cricket pitches of Van Cortlandt Park,” Mamdani said during a Sunday night rally in Brooklyn attended by over a thousand supporters. “Ours is a movement that asks New Yorkers to reimagine what we think is possible—and we’ve built it together, side by side, door by door.” Meanwhile, many of the other major candidates—including city Comptroller Brad Lander, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and Brooklyn state senator Zellnor Myrie—have failed to gain traction. That has remained true even as each of them has notched their own major endorsements . ‘Getting late early’ for the Democratic field Mayoral candidates Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, and Scott Stringer attend a climate candidates forum. Photo by Gabriele Holtermann Democratic strategist Trip Yang said Cuomo and Mamdani are leading the field in first and second place due to name recognition, institutional backing, and grassroots support, respectively. “It’s really Cuomo’s name ID and perceived political strength, getting all of these endorsements, that has him out in the lead and Zohran running a very energetic, free-spirited, authentic economic-populist style of campaign that has him surging to second place,” Yang told amNewYork Metro. “Aside from that, you have a bunch of the other candidates bunched up together.” Since even before officially jumping into the race, Cuomo’s rivals have been attacking him nearly every day over his record as governor and the scandals — including the sexual misconduct allegations and his handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes, which he denies — that brought down his administration. They have also hit him over skipping most mayoral forums, holding limited press availabilities , accepting contributions from Trump donors , and using AI for research in crafting his housing plan . Another Democratic strategist, Evan Stavitsky, said that with just weeks to go until the June 24 primary, candidates are running out of time to chip away at Cuomo’s lead and change the shape of the race. “Yogi Berra famously said, ‘it’s getting late early out there,'” Stavitsky said, quoting the legendary New York Yankees catcher. “He was talking about baseball, but the same holds true for the mayor’s race. The closer that we get to the start of early voting with nothing to shake up the dynamic of the race, the harder it is for someone to surge to the top who can provide a credible challenge to Andrew Cuomo.” Is TV Cuomo’s worst enemy? Although none of the attacks on Cuomo so far appear to have affected his numbers, that dynamic could change now that candidates are spending money to promote their negative messaging"

That tension is already visible in ads released by Mamdani and Myrie over the past couple of weeks, with Mamdani using his spot to contrast himself with Cuomo and Myrie choosing to focus on his own biography. Furthermore, Yang said there is a “collective action problem” that arises when trying to get various candidates who all want to be mayor to act in concert. He said that while the Working Families Party endorsed a slate of four candidates — Mamdani, Lander, Speaker Adams, and Myrie — as an alliance against Cuomo, those contenders are all still looking out for themselves first. Stavisky argued that even if candidates collectively hit the airwaves to attack Cuomo there is no guarantee that will make a difference, given that he is a known entity much of whose baggage has been public for years. “He’s really well known and really well defined in the minds of voters,” Stavisky said. “He may have a ceiling to his support, but he also has a much higher floor.” That tension is already visible in ads released by Mamdani and Myrie over the past couple of weeks, with Mamdani using his spot to contrast himself with Cuomo and Myrie choosing to focus on his own biography.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday that he will run on a new third-party ballot line in the general election, despite his sizable lead in the run-up to the Democratic primary. The move would allow the former governor to compete in November even if he loses the June primary. And it could help him appeal to non-Democrats in what could be a competitive general election – a rare event in majority-Democratic New York City made more likely by the fact that incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is also running as an independent. Cuomo said in a statement that he would seek to appeal to “disillusioned Democrats, as well as independents and Republicans” by running on an independent ballot line called “Fight and Deliver.” Multiple polls show that Cuomo is the front-runner in the Democratic primary with a double-digit lead. Adams, facing record-low approval ratings and a torrent of scandal over his since-dismissed federal indictment, decided to skip the Democratic primary and run as an independent after Cuomo entered the race. Adams plans to run on two ballot lines , “EndAntiSemitism” and “Safe&Affordable.” On Tuesday, he accused Cuomo of stealing from his playbook. “I thought the word was ‘I’m going to be like Mike, not I’m going to be like Eric,’” he said, referring to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Cuomo has held up Bloomberg as the only competent manager the city has recently elected as mayor. The tactic of running on an independent ballot line is not new to Cuomo, who in 2014 launched the Women’s Equality Party in an attempt to win over more women voters. He resigned as governor in 2021 after being found responsible for sexually harassing 11 women, though he denies the accusations. “It’s just hedging his bets,” said Trip Yang, a democratic strategist. “He is very familiar with running on multiple party lines in a general election.” Cuomo’s new third-party ballot line means there could be at least five candidates on the ballot in November, including Adams, Cuomo, likely Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, and independent candidate Jim Walden. The Working Families Party, a progressive third party and longtime nemesis of Cuomo, has made plans to run their own candidate in November should any of their endorsed picks fail to win the June Democratic primary. The party has endorsed City Council speaker Adrienne Adams, city Comptroller Brad Lander, state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and state Sen. Zellnor Myrie in a currently unranked slate. Unlike the primary, the general election will not use ranked choice voting, which allows voters to choose up to five candidates. Instead, candidates can run on multiple ballot lines and combine the votes for their total tally. Cuomo’s primary competitors took to social media Tuesday to ridicule the former governor's strategy. “He’s scared,” Mamdani said on X . Mamdani is second in polling and fundraising and is the most left-leaning candidate in the race. Last month, he unveiled the first TV ad in the race attacking Cuomo. Over the weekend, his campaign held a concert-style rally in Brooklyn that drew around 1,500 people. “Why doesn’t he just follow in @NYCMayor 's footsteps, make it official, and become a Republican?” Lander wrote, facetiously. While the mayor’s friendly relationship with the Trump administration has fueled rumors that he would switch back to the Republican Party, he remains a registered Democrat. Adams suggested there was more drama in store for voters. “This is going to be an election with a lot of twists and turns,” he told reporters on Tuesday.
