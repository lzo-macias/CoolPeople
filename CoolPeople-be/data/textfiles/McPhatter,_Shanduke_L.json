That’s $24,000 more than the mayor. The News exclusively reported earlier this month that McPhatter, a self-professed former gang member, was arrested Jan. 6 for allegedly menacing his neighbor, an NYPD traffic agent. By Chelsia Rose Marcius and Marco Poggio UPDATED: March 13, 2020 at 8:52 PM EDT A Brooklyn judge ordered a prominent anti-gang activist to stay away from the neighbor he allegedly threatened to have killed by the Bloods. Shanduke McPhatter — a former Bloods member and founder of the fully city-funded group Gangstas Making Astronomical Community Changes — appeared before Judge Gina Levy Abadi on Wednesday in Brooklyn Criminal Court as part of the ongoing case. “I’m going to get my people, the Bloods, to come handle you. I’m going to have you killed,” McPhatter told his neighbor in December, according to a criminal complaint. The neighbor works in traffic enforcement for the NYPD. The Daily News reported exclusively on the accusations last month and how McPhatter was paid a staggering $282,990 salary by the city to head G-MACC. Several people in the courtroom on Wednesday wore GMACC shirts to show him support. When a News reporter asked about the allegations, McPhatter — who sported a stylish black suit and stud-covered gray shoes — said, “You can’t be serious.” McPhatter has long been lauded by Mayor de Blasio, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and Attorney General Jumaane Williams for his anti-gang activism. His advocacy group received more than $1.5 million in city funding between 2014 and 2018, according to its most recent non-profit tax filing. His attorney, Edward Pichardo, declined to comment on the case.

Shanduke McPhatter — a former Bloods member and founder of the fully city-funded group Gangstas Making Astronomical Community Changes — appeared before Judge Gina Levy Abadi on Wednesday in Brooklyn Criminal Court as part of the ongoing case. “I’m going to get my people, the Bloods, to come handle you. I’m going to have you killed,” McPhatter told his neighbor in December, according to a criminal complaint. The neighbor works in traffic enforcement for the NYPD. The Daily News reported exclusively on the accusations last month and how McPhatter was paid a staggering $282,990 salary by the city to head G-MACC. Several people in the courtroom on Wednesday wore GMACC shirts to show him support. When a News reporter asked about the allegations, McPhatter — who sported a stylish black suit and stud-covered gray shoes — said, “You can’t be serious.” McPhatter has long been lauded by Mayor de Blasio, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and Attorney General Jumaane Williams for his anti-gang activism. His advocacy group received more than $1.5 million in city funding between 2014 and 2018, according to its most recent non-profit tax filing. His attorney, Edward Pichardo, declined to comment on the case.

I’m going to have you killed,” activist Shanduke McPhatter told his neighbor, according to a criminal complaint. The former Bloods member’s group, Gangstas Making Astronomical Community Changes, has been a fixture at protests against gun violence alongside prominent politicians since it first partnered with City Hall in 2014.

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams has contributed city funds to G-MACC for years. The Mayor’s Office to Prevent Gun Violence listed G-MACC as a resource for recently-released Rikers Island inmates. The advocacy group received more than $1.5 million in city funding between 2014 and 2018, according to its most recent non-profit tax filing. But McPhatter’s recent arrest for threatening his neighbor, who works in traffic enforcement for the NYPD, as well as a recent federal takedown of a Rikers Island contraband ring, have raised questions about the anti-gang group.

Jonathan Medina, who has been charged with being an intermediary in a Rikers Island contraband scheme, is to the right. Expand By Chelsia Rose Marcius and Stephen Rex Brown UPDATED: February 3, 2020 at 1:50 AM EST A prominent anti-gang activist with ties to City Hall is accused of threatening to sic the Bloods on his Brooklyn neighbor. “I’m going to get my people, the Bloods, to come handle you. I’m going to have you killed,” activist Shanduke McPhatter told his neighbor, according to a criminal complaint. The former Bloods member’s group, Gangstas Making Astronomical Community Changes, has been a fixture at protests against gun violence alongside prominent politicians since it first partnered with City Hall in 2014. Last month, McPhatter, who founded the group, attended a meeting with Mayor de Blasio and received a proclamation from Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams has contributed city funds to G-MACC for years. The Mayor’s Office to Prevent Gun Violence listed G-MACC as a resource for recently-released Rikers Island inmates. The advocacy group received more than $1.5 million in city funding between 2014 and 2018, according to its most recent non-profit tax filing. But McPhatter’s recent arrest for threatening his neighbor, who works in traffic enforcement for the NYPD, as well as a recent federal takedown of a Rikers Island contraband ring, have raised questions about the anti-gang group.

A G-MACC staffer and McPhatter’s brother are among those charged with the smuggling operation allegedly involving crooked correction officers. City Hall said it was unaware of “the extent” of the allegations involving G-MACC. The group is no longer providing re-entry services to former Rikers inmates as the city conducts a review. “The described allegations are unacceptable and of great concern. To ensure G-MACC is able to serve our neighborhoods in a manner that reflects the values of our administration, we are requiring the organization to strengthen their internal protocols and procedures,” City Hall spokeswoman Avery Cohen said. Shanduke McPhatter (left), the founder of Gangsters Making Astronomical Community Change, has rubbed elbows with Mayor de Blasio (right) and spoken at Brooklyn Borough Hall in the last week. McPhatter is accused of threatening his neighbor on Carlton Ave. in Brooklyn on Dec. 23. After threatening to call in the Bloods, McPhatter again menaced the neighbor on Jan. 2, prosecutors say. “Hey copper, I have not forgotten what I said, I’m going to finish what I said, I’m going to shoot you,” McPhatter, 41, allegedly said. He was arrested on Jan. 6, charged with misdemeanor menacing and harassment, and released without bail. Two weeks later on Martin Luther King Day, McPhatter attended a meeting of the city’s Anti-Violence Crisis Management System. The initiative “uses credible messengers — many of whom have previous involvement in the criminal justice system — to identify and mediate conflicts before they escalate in areas with high gun violence,” according to City Hall. McPhatter posted a video of himself as de Blasio spoke in the background. “Showing the world what this movement is. Making sure people feel the appreciation and support,” de Blasio told the small gathering. “We’re all aiming for the same thing.” McPhatter delivered a speech at Brooklyn Borough Hall two days later, advocating for formerly incarcerated people, according to his social media . He received a proclamation honoring his efforts. “The Borough President was unaware of Mr. McPhatter’s arrest until now. In the years the Borough President has interacted with Mr. McPhatter, he has known him to have a strong commitment to ending gun violence,” Adams spokesman Jonah Allon said. McPhatter is due in court on Feb. 5. “I have advised my client not to speak with the press as we work through the criminal process pursuant to Mr. McPhatter’s recent arrest,” Legal Aid attorney John Williams said. “As he has from the beginning of the case, Mr. McPhatter emphatically denies the charges in this case.” But as McPhatter fights the case, G-MACC associates are also the subject of a major federal contraband investigation at Rikers Island. One alleged intermediary in the contraband scheme, Jonathan “Trigg” Medina, was a “violence interrupter supervisor” who led mediation workshops for G-MACC at Rikers, according to an online bio . He last worked in the jail in November 2017, a Department of Correction spokesman said. McPhatter posted a photo with Medina, 29, on Instagram in December. An inmate allegedly at the center of the smuggling, James “Jah Blize” Albert, identifies himself as “director of operation” of G-MACC on LinkedIn. A source with knowledge confirmed that Albert has also used the name James McPhatter, who was identified in a 2014 article as co-founder of G-MACC. Albert and Shanduke McPhatter are brothers, the source said. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Medina and Albert, 43, were among those involved in a months-long plot to sneak weed and suboxone into Rikers by bribing six corrupt correction officers. The two used Bloods lingo like “Oakland Raider jerseys” for marijuana, “Jungle” for Brooklyn and “pink panties” for a correction officer, according to a criminal complaint. Albert had not worked for G-MACC at Rikers, the DOC spokesman said. G-MACC had provided a variety of programming at the jail, including a seven-week workshop for incarcerated adolescents, according to its website. G-MACC worked at the jail off and on beginning in 2015. They last provided “limited conflict resolution services” in June 2019, the DOC spokesman said. G-MACC was allowed into the jail over the objections of DOC’s intel unit, which was troubled by social media showing members of the group flashing gang signs, a former high-ranking member of the unit said. “We were against it but we were overruled,” the former member said. The objections, which were raised within the last year, were"

    "text": "complaint. The former Bloods member’s group, Gangstas Making Astronomical Community Changes, has been a fixture at protests against gun violence alongside prominent politicians since it first partnered with City Hall in 2014. Last month, McPhatter, who founded the group, attended a meeting with Mayor de Blasio and received a proclamation from Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams has contributed city funds to G-MACC for years. The Mayor’s Office to Prevent Gun Violence listed G-MACC as a resource for recently-released Rikers Island inmates. The advocacy group received more than $1.5 million in city funding between 2014 and 2018, according to its most recent non-profit tax filing. But McPhatter’s recent arrest for threatening his neighbor, who works in traffic enforcement for the NYPD, as well as a recent federal takedown of a Rikers Island contraband ring, have raised questions about the anti-gang group. Two of the people charged in the bust have ties to the advocacy group, which includes former gang members who know first-hand the danger of street life. A G-MACC staffer and McPhatter’s brother are among those charged with the smuggling operation allegedly involving crooked correction officers. City Hall said it was unaware of “the extent” of the allegations involving G-MACC. The group is no longer providing re-entry services to former Rikers inmates as the city conducts a review. “The described allegations are unacceptable and of great concern. To ensure G-MACC is able to serve our neighborhoods in a manner that reflects the values of our administration, we are requiring the organization to strengthen their internal protocols and procedures,” City Hall spokeswoman Avery Cohen said. McPhatter is accused of threatening his neighbor on Carlton Ave. in Brooklyn on Dec. 23. After threatening to call in the Bloods, McPhatter again menaced the neighbor on Jan. 2, prosecutors say. “Hey copper, I have not forgotten what I said, I’m going to finish what I said, I’m going to shoot you,” McPhatter, 41, allegedly said. He was arrested on Jan. 6, charged with misdemeanor menacing and harassment, and released without bail. Two weeks later on Martin Luther King Day, McPhatter attended a meeting of the city’s Anti-Violence Crisis Management System. The initiative “uses credible messengers — many of whom have previous involvement in the criminal justice system — to identify and mediate conflicts before they escalate in areas with high gun violence,” according to City Hall. McPhatter posted a video of himself as de Blasio spoke in the background. “Showing the world what this movement is. Making sure people feel the appreciation and support,” de Blasio told the small gathering. “We’re all aiming for the same thing.” McPhatter delivered a speech at Brooklyn Borough Hall two days later, advocating for formerly incarcerated people, according to his social media . He received a proclamation honoring his efforts. “The Borough President was unaware of Mr. McPhatter’s arrest until now. In the years the Borough President has interacted with Mr. McPhatter, he has known him to have a strong commitment to ending gun violence,” Adams spokesman Jonah Allon said. McPhatter is due in court on Feb. 5. “I have advised my client not to speak with the press as we work through the criminal process pursuant to Mr. McPhatter’s recent arrest,” Legal Aid attorney John Williams said. “As he has from the beginning of the case, Mr. McPhatter emphatically denies the charges in this case.” But as McPhatter fights the case, G-MACC associates are also the subject of a major federal contraband investigation at Rikers Island. One alleged intermediary in the contraband scheme, Jonathan “Trigg” Medina, was a “violence interrupter supervisor” who led mediation workshops for G-MACC at Rikers, according to an online bio . He last worked in the jail in November 2017, a Department of Correction spokesman said. McPhatter posted a photo with Medina, 29, on Instagram in December. An inmate allegedly at the center of the smuggling, James “Jah Blize” Albert, identifies himself as “director of operation” of G-MACC on LinkedIn. A source with knowledge confirmed that Albert has also used the name James McPhatter, who was identified in a 2014 article as co-founder of G-MACC. Albert and Shanduke McPhatter are brothers, the source said. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Medina and Albert, 43, were among those involved in a months-long plot to sneak weed and suboxone into Rikers by bribing six corrupt correction officers. The two used Bloods lingo like “Oakland Raider jerseys” for marijuana, “Jungle” for Brooklyn and “pink panties” for a correction officer, according to a criminal"

That resulted in G-MACC being temporarily barred from the jail. “They are still gang members and they’re manipulating the jail system,” a jails insider said. “They duped the department that they are trying to do good.” Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Arrests underway as pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia take over Butler Library Arrests underway as pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia take over Butler Library Arrests underway as pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia take over Butler Library Brooklyn teen mourning slain friend is shot to death 2 days later in retaliation Brooklyn teen mourning slain friend is shot to death 2 days later in retaliation Brooklyn teen mourning slain friend is shot to death 2 days later in retaliation Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sports full head of gray hair during jury selection Sean 'Diddy' Combs sports full head of gray hair during jury selection Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sports full head of gray hair during jury selection First U.S. pope elected: Robert Cardinal Prevost will be Pope Leo XIV First U.S. pope elected: Robert Cardinal Prevost will be Pope Leo XIV First U.S. pope elected: Robert Cardinal Prevost will be Pope Leo XIV Man chokes woman in Manhattan subway car in unprovoked attack: cops Man chokes woman in Manhattan subway car in unprovoked attack: cops Man chokes woman in Manhattan subway car in unprovoked attack: cops New report shows NYC helicopter breaking apart in midair before crash that killed 6 New report shows NYC helicopter breaking apart in midair before crash that killed 6 New report shows NYC helicopter breaking apart in midair before crash that killed 6 ‘Boardwalk Empire’ star Michael Pitt arrested in Brooklyn for sexual abuse ‘Boardwalk Empire’ star Michael Pitt arrested in Brooklyn for sexual abuse ‘Boardwalk Empire’ star Michael Pitt arrested in Brooklyn for sexual abuse Brooklyn public school principal busted for DWI after vehicle overturns in crash Brooklyn public school principal busted for DWI after vehicle overturns in crash Brooklyn public school principal busted for DWI after vehicle overturns in crash Smokey Robinson accused of rape, sexual assault by 4 former housekeepers Smokey Robinson accused of rape, sexual assault by 4 former housekeepers Smokey Robinson accused of rape, sexual assault by 4 former housekeepers SEE IT: Kanye West storms out of Piers Morgan interview — again SEE IT: Kanye West storms out of Piers Morgan interview — again SEE IT: Kanye West"

    "text": "complaint. Albert had not worked for G-MACC at Rikers, the DOC spokesman said. G-MACC had provided a variety of programming at the jail, including a seven-week workshop for incarcerated adolescents, according to its website. G-MACC worked at the jail off and on beginning in 2015. They last provided “limited conflict resolution services” in June 2019, the DOC spokesman said. G-MACC was allowed into the jail over the objections of DOC’s intel unit, which was troubled by social media showing members of the group flashing gang signs, a former high-ranking member of the unit said. “We were against it but we were overruled,” the former member said. The objections, which were raised within the last year, were dismissed due to pressure from City Hall, the source said. Messages for Medina’s attorney were not returned. Albert, who is currently serving a sentence of 23 years to life in state prison for robbery, had not been assigned an attorney for the contraband case. A lawyer who previously represented Albert declined to comment. Former Correction commissioner Martin Horn cautioned that isolated instances of jail volunteers smuggling contraband should not diminish the importance of partnerships with community groups. “You can do all the vetting in the world. At the end of the day we’re dependent upon the people,” said Horn, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “The question always has to be, did we take reasonable steps to minimize risk?” The Brooklyn Borough President’s office agreed, citing declines in violence where G-MACC operated in East Flatbush. “The model has proven to be extremely effective,” the spokesman said.

Shanduke McPhatter, the embattled violence interrupter who got into hot water for allegedly threatening an NYPD traffic cop , is vying to become Brooklyn’s next borough president. Shanduke McPhatter “I’m going to focus on a safe borough. I put a lot of time and effort into community safety,” the former member of the Bloods street gang said. “How do we focus on all the other issues if the community isn’t safe?” McPhatter runs the anti-violence nonprofit Gangtas Making Astronomical Community Changes, which in 2020 raked in $2.3 million — much of it from the city — to pay for its efforts to reduce violence. A significant part of that money went to paying McPhatter’s salary, which at one point stood at an exorbitant $282,990 — about $20,000 more than what Mayor de Blasio makes. McPhatter ultimately saw his pay reduced to $157,828 after the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice audited the nonprofit. But it appears McPhatter may now be in line for more taxpayer cash — the city Campaign Finance Board records list him as a “participant” in its publicly funded campaign finance program. “This guy just doesn’t know when to quit,” said one police source of McPhatter’s run. “He was ostracized by City Hall due to a few high-profile arrests and the last straw was his bloated $282,000 annual salary that he paid himself, compared to the typical violence interrupter salary of $79,000. Then he just rebranded himself as an activist and published author.” McPhatter’s campaign Facebook page notes that the “campaign is inspired by the passion and desire to cultivate a unified and safer Brooklyn.” To date, the campaign has 578 likes on Facebook.

On Thursday, during his State of the City presentation, de Blasio said he would be creating a joint task force to end gun violence that would consist of both the NYPD and violence interrupters. “We’ll use the power of the Cure Violence Movement and the Crisis Management System to deepen its reach in our communities,” he said during the pretaped presentation. “We’ll double the workforce that does this crucial work, involving and engaging community members to solve community problems.” De Blasio and police reform advocates have been singing the praises of violence interrupters for months and have presented them as an alternative to solely using police to stem the tide of violence that has recently washed over the city. But the movement is not without its blemishes. On Thursday, a violence interrupter for a different group based in the Bronx, Stand Up to Violence, was charged with murder .

Shanduke McPhatter Last February, the former gang member was accused in a criminal complaint of threatening to order the Bloods to attack a neighbor, who works as an NYPD traffic agent. “I’m going to get my people, the Bloods, to come handle you. I’m going to have you killed,” he told the neighbor, according to the complaint. McPhatter denied the accusation Friday, saying it “never happened.” “If the person had this altercation, it wasn’t me,” he said. “I just want my name to be cleared.” The political campaign is an unexpected move for McPhatter, who has a court appearance in August — after the Democratic primary — on charges of threatening the traffic cop. Last year he was forced to take a step back from his public role as executive director of GMACC after the Daily News revealed the criminal charge, as well as charges against a GMACC “violence interrupter supervisor” for allegedly participating in a contraband ring at Rikers Island. A Nov. 2019 audit obtained by the Daily News through a Freedom of Information Law request also shows problems at GMACC were deeper than previously known. In addition to McPhatter’s eye-popping salary, investigators at the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice found $116,250 worth of “questioned costs.” GMACC’s Deputy Director Tiffany Lemela also gave herself an 80% raise in 2018 — from $85,000 per year to $153,000. After McPhatter signed off on a “corrective action plan” in March 2020 with the city declaring him persona non grata at City Hall , he posted several videos on Instagram showing tense confrontations with cops in Fort Greene.

Shanduke McPhatter, the embattled violence interrupter who got into hot water for allegedly threatening an NYPD traffic cop , is vying to become Brooklyn’s next borough president. “I’m going to focus on a safe borough. I put a lot of time and effort into community safety,” the former member of the Bloods street gang said. “How do we focus on all the other issues if the community isn’t safe?” McPhatter runs the anti-violence nonprofit Gangtas Making Astronomical Community Changes, which in 2020 raked in $2.3 million — much of it from the city — to pay for its efforts to reduce violence. A significant part of that money went to paying McPhatter’s salary, which at one point stood at an exorbitant $282,990 — about $20,000 more than what Mayor de Blasio makes. McPhatter ultimately saw his pay reduced to $157,828 after the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice audited the nonprofit. But it appears McPhatter may now be in line for more taxpayer cash — the city Campaign Finance Board records list him as a “participant” in its publicly funded campaign finance program. “This guy just doesn’t know when to quit,” said one police source of McPhatter’s run. “He was ostracized by City Hall due to a few high-profile arrests and the last straw was his bloated $282,000 annual salary that he paid himself, compared to the typical violence interrupter salary of $79,000. Then he just rebranded himself as an activist and published author.” McPhatter’s campaign Facebook page notes that the “campaign is inspired by the passion and desire to cultivate a unified and safer Brooklyn.” To date, the campaign has 578 likes on Facebook.

Shanduke McPhatter, the embattled violence interrupter who got into hot water for allegedly threatening an NYPD traffic cop , is vying to become Brooklyn’s next borough president. “I’m going to focus on a safe borough. I put a lot of time and effort into community safety,” the former member of the Bloods street gang said. “How do we focus on all the other issues if the community isn’t safe?” McPhatter runs the anti-violence nonprofit Gangtas Making Astronomical Community Changes, which in 2020 raked in $2.3 million — much of it from the city — to pay for its efforts to reduce violence. A significant part of that money went to paying McPhatter’s salary, which at one point stood at an exorbitant $282,990 — about $20,000 more than what Mayor de Blasio makes. McPhatter ultimately saw his pay reduced to $157,828 after the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice audited the nonprofit. But it appears McPhatter may now be in line for more taxpayer cash — the city Campaign Finance Board records list him as a “participant” in its publicly funded campaign finance program. “This guy just doesn’t know when to quit,” said one police source of McPhatter’s run. “He was ostracized by City Hall due to a few high-profile arrests and the last straw was his bloated $282,000 annual salary that he paid himself, compared to the typical violence interrupter salary of $79,000. Then he just rebranded himself as an activist and published author.” McPhatter’s campaign Facebook page notes that the “campaign is inspired by the passion and desire to cultivate a unified and safer Brooklyn.” To date, the campaign has 578 likes on Facebook. Mayor de Blasio has made cure-violence programs like McPhatter’s a central piece of his police reform agenda. On Thursday, during his State of the City presentation, de Blasio said he would be creating a joint task force to end gun violence that would consist of both the NYPD and violence interrupters. “We’ll use the power of the Cure Violence Movement and the Crisis Management System to deepen its reach in our communities,” he said during the pretaped presentation. “We’ll double the workforce that does this crucial work, involving and engaging community members to solve community problems.” De Blasio and police reform advocates have been singing the praises of violence interrupters for months and have presented them as an alternative to solely using police to stem the tide of violence that has recently washed over the city.

    "text": "altercation, it wasn’t me,” he said. “I just want my name to be cleared.” The political campaign is an unexpected move for McPhatter, who has a court appearance in August — after the Democratic primary — on charges of threatening the traffic cop. Last year he was forced to take a step back from his public role as executive director of GMACC after the Daily News revealed the criminal charge, as well as charges against a GMACC “violence interrupter supervisor” for allegedly participating in a contraband ring at Rikers Island. A Nov. 2019 audit obtained by the Daily News through a Freedom of Information Law request also shows problems at GMACC were deeper than previously known. In addition to McPhatter’s eye-popping salary, investigators at the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice found $116,250 worth of “questioned costs.” GMACC’s Deputy Director Tiffany Lemela also gave herself an 80% raise in 2018 — from $85,000 per year to $153,000. After McPhatter signed off on a “corrective action plan” in March 2020 with the city declaring him persona non grata at City Hall , he posted several videos on Instagram showing tense confrontations with cops in Fort Greene. He also unloaded on city officials, including Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice Deputy Director Eric Cumberbatch and now-former MOCJ executive director Liz Glazer. “ #88pct got a Nypd officer who don’t know me to lie and create a false charge in this conspired character defamation. This never happened. Then the Mayor’s office got with the daily news and fed them inaccurate information to assist the Mayor and Liz Glazer the Director of The mayors office of criminal justice who “Pioneered the Rico Act to prosecute Gang members. ERIC CUMBERBATCH SOLD HIS SOUL and left us for dead knowing how foul and the mismanaged that office,” McPhatter wrote, alongside an image of the Daily News cover on Feb. 3. “They gave me the front page the day after the #superbowl !!
