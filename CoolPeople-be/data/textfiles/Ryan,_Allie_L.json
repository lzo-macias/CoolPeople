Expand all | Collapse all Expand all Collapse all Who are you? Tell us about yourself. My family and I are long time fixtures of the East Village & Lower East Side arts, music, bicycling & environmental communities. I am proud to raise my kids here. I am running to represent District 2 because I am one of many people who have been adversely affected by policies recently passed by City Council and the deBlasio administration, such as the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project and New York City public schools not meeting the needs of our children. I know first hand that our district needs BOTH flood protection and parkland. Kids have been experiencing knowledge loss between grade levels for years leading me to the position that the school year and academic curriculum need to be reformed. I have been a community organizer with a mom perspective. Yet, the reality is, right now quality of life issues truly dominate the conversation. I am experiencing many of the same issues as my neighbors in District 2 such as noise, crime, trash, rats, street safety and a lack of real affordable housing. As a documentary filmmaker, I have shed light on some of these subjects ranging from former inmates re-entering society, transportation alternatives such as urban cycling infrastructure, and advocates for free speech and freedom of assembly.

What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time? When I was in elementary school during summer school a teacher let us watch the space shuttle go into space. It was the only time I remember a teacher bringing out a television for students to watch. Everyone in the classroom was in awe to see the space shuttle blasting off into space. To this day, I remember staring at the large (now small by comparison ) television on an AV cart with everyone counting together \"3-2-1- Blast Off!\" as the space shuttle's rockets blasted fire. I was almost 9 years old. What was your very first job? How long did you have it? My first job out of college was working for a start up credentialing service that streamlined a doctor application process to apply for doctor privileges at hospitals in Richmond, Virginia. At the same time on the weekends I worked at an art museum at the front desk and in the coat room. I learned to work with others as well as representing the organizations I worked for to the public. I learned to manage an ever-changing case load with varying deadlines. I enjoyed having the opportunity to visit art exhibitions, which fueled my love of art history. Juggling two jobs meant working every day. I worked at the start up for two years and I worked at the museum for 5 years. What is your favorite book? Why? Maps to the Other Side: The Adventures of a Bipolar Cartographer by Sasha Altman DuBrul is my favorite book. Sasha has been friends with my husband from the 1990s so I was familiar with Sasha as a member of the Lower East Side political ska-punk community. However, DuBrul's life is so much more than a musician. For one, he is a co-founder of the Icarus Project, providing alternative forms of help and care for people who suffer from Bipolarmental health challenges. Overall, I love DuBrul's storytelling and interweaving of BiPolar Disorder, Youthful Wanderlust and Gardening. The way the book is structured, I was able to savor each chapter and reflect before reading the next chapter. I wish this book was given to every high school student as they begin their junior year. DuBrul's passion for life and courage to live a life he wants to live is inspiring. I live to give this book as gifts to family and friends. Debating a career change or wishing you could do something but don't have the resources... read this book. DuBrul re-examines and affirms the tried and true saying \"If there's a will, there's a way.\" Overall, I love DuBrul's storytelling and interweaving of BiPolar Disorder, Youthful Wanderlust and Gardening.

Photo by Renée Monrose. I’d like to introduce myself to the readers of The Village View, particularly those of you in the redistricted blocks surrounding Washington Square Park. I am running to represent you as your new City Councilperson. Many of you know me due to my fighting alongside neighbors to save the Morton Williams supermarket and ensure our seniors are not left in a food shopping desert. Or you may know me for battling to dismantle the once useful restaurant sheds, now a burden on residents and boon only to rats and restaurant landlords. Or perhaps you remember me as a tireless park crusader who was arrested battling to save the 1,000 mature trees sentenced to death at East River Park or my work to prevent the destruction of the Elizabeth Street Garden and who secured the cleanup and re-seeding of Tompkins Square Park. Either way, you can rest assured that I will be hands-on in fighting for District 2’s newest entry, Washington Square Park, as it has changed to a point where residents are paying armed guards to fill in where their tax dollars and elected officials have failed them. Now those of you who DON’T know me might be interested in the fact that I am a Democrat, pro-choice, pro-education, pro-small business, pro-neighborhood preservation and anti-taking money from multi-millionaire developer and special interest lobbyists. I have no interest in becoming a shill and rubber stamper for their interests. Before joining the political realm, I was a documentary film producer covering issues of Free Speech, Right of Assembly and those re-entering society after being incarcerated. Our household is a union household and my filmmaker husband is a 25-year IATSE member currently standing in solidarity with the Writers Guild of America I am a cancer survivor, mother of two, avid cyclist who is fighting against the middle and working class killing congestion pricing. Why? Because New York City is a diverse city with diverse transportation needs and we need to have leaders that recognize and represent the interests of ALL of their constituents. If you would like to know more about my opponent, the incumbent Carlina Rivera, I recommend you call her office when you have a problem and see how you are treated and what the ultimate result is. My team and I easily gathered over four times the required signatures to secure my name on the Democratic Primary Ballot often simply by answering the question about who I am running against. Clipboards were practically pulled from my hands as the constituents on the streets asked “Where do I sign?” Not once did I find a supporter who tried to convince me I was taking on an opponent who should serve two more years. The constituents have been ignored, insulted and subjected to divisive tactics for the last six years and they know what business as usual will look like. I hope you will reach out and perform due diligence on both myself and my opponent before rubber stamping a de Blasio leftover who I am sure does not want you to research her. After reading, speaking to neighbors and listening to your gut. I hope you will trust in me to have your backs and fight for your neighborhood as well as all of Council District 2. District 2 needs someone to represent the residents, NOT the developers, special interests and politicians who are never made to suffer and live with the consequences of their own poor policies. Allie Ryan is a Democrat running for City Council District 2, which includes Greenwich Village, NoHo, Union Square, East Village, Lower East Side, Gramercy and Kips Bay.

Photo by Renée Monrose. I’d like to introduce myself to the readers of The Village View, particularly those of you in the redistricted blocks surrounding Washington Square Park. I am running to represent you as your new City Councilperson. Many of you know me due to my fighting alongside neighbors to save the Morton Williams supermarket and ensure our seniors are not left in a food shopping desert. Or you may know me for battling to dismantle the once useful restaurant sheds, now a burden on residents and boon only to rats and restaurant landlords. Or perhaps you remember me as a tireless park crusader who was arrested battling to save the 1,000 mature trees sentenced to death at East River Park or my work to prevent the destruction of the Elizabeth Street Garden and who secured the cleanup and re-seeding of Tompkins Square Park. Either way, you can rest assured that I will be hands-on in fighting for District 2’s newest entry, Washington Square Park, as it has changed to a point where residents are paying armed guards to fill in where their tax dollars and elected officials have failed them. Now those of you who DON’T know me might be interested in the fact that I am a Democrat, pro-choice, pro-education, pro-small business, pro-neighborhood preservation and anti-taking money from multi-millionaire developer and special interest lobbyists. I have no interest in becoming a shill and rubber stamper for their interests. Before joining the political realm, I was a documentary film producer covering issues of Free Speech, Right of Assembly and those re-entering society after being incarcerated. Our household is a union household and my filmmaker husband is a 25-year IATSE member currently standing in solidarity with the Writers Guild of America I am a cancer survivor, mother of two, avid cyclist who is fighting against the middle and working class killing congestion pricing. Why? Because New York City is a diverse city with diverse transportation needs and we need to have leaders that recognize and represent the interests of ALL of their constituents. If you would like to know more about my opponent, the incumbent Carlina Rivera, I recommend you call her office when you have a problem and see how you are treated and what the ultimate result is. My team and I easily gathered over four times the required signatures to secure my name on the Democratic Primary Ballot often simply by answering the question about who I am running against. Clipboards were practically pulled from my hands as the constituents on the streets asked “Where do I sign?” Not once did I find a supporter who tried to convince me I was taking on an opponent who should serve two more years. The constituents have been ignored, insulted and subjected to divisive tactics for the last six years and they know what business as usual will look like. I hope you will reach out and perform due diligence on both myself and my opponent before rubber stamping a de Blasio leftover who I am sure does not want you to research her.

Clipboards were practically pulled from my hands as the constituents on the streets asked “Where do I sign?” Not once did I find a supporter who tried to convince me I was taking on an opponent who should serve two more years. The constituents have been ignored, insulted and subjected to divisive tactics for the last six years and they know what business as usual will look like. I hope you will reach out and perform due diligence on both myself and my opponent before rubber stamping a de Blasio leftover who I am sure does not want you to research her. After reading, speaking to neighbors and listening to your gut. I hope you will trust in me to have your backs and fight for your neighborhood as well as all of Council District 2. District 2 needs someone to represent the residents, NOT the developers, special interests and politicians who are never made to suffer and live with the consequences of their own poor policies. Allie Ryan is a Democrat running for City Council District 2, which includes Greenwich Village, NoHo, Union Square, East Village, Lower East Side, Gramercy and Kips Bay.

Or you may know me for battling to dismantle the once useful restaurant sheds, now a burden on residents and boon only to rats and restaurant landlords. Or perhaps you remember me as a tireless park crusader who was arrested battling to save the 1,000 mature trees sentenced to death at East River Park or my work to prevent the destruction of the Elizabeth Street Garden and who secured the cleanup and re-seeding of Tompkins Square Park. Either way, you can rest assured that I will be hands-on in fighting for District 2’s newest entry, Washington Square Park, as it has changed to a point where residents are paying armed guards to fill in where their tax dollars and elected officials have failed them. Now those of you who DON’T know me might be interested in the fact that I am a Democrat, pro-choice, pro-education, pro-small business, pro-neighborhood preservation and anti-taking money from multi-millionaire developer and special interest lobbyists. I have no interest in becoming a shill and rubber stamper for their interests. Before joining the political realm, I was a documentary film producer covering issues of Free Speech, Right of Assembly and those re-entering society after being incarcerated. Our household is a union household and my filmmaker husband is a 25-year IATSE member currently standing in solidarity with the Writers Guild of America I am a cancer survivor, mother of two, avid cyclist who is fighting against the middle and working class killing congestion pricing. Why? Because New York City is a diverse city with diverse transportation needs and we need to have leaders that recognize and represent the interests of ALL of their constituents.
