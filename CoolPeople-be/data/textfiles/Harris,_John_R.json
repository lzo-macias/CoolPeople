The complaint says the four, unnamed women were housekeepers of the Robinsons at the time of the alleged misconduct. Robinson's wife Frances Robinson is also named. Law Harvey Weinstein's trial is underway in Manhattan The complaint alleges that Jane Doe 1, who was a housekeeper for the Robinsons from January 2023 to February 2024, was forced to resign due to Smokey Robinson's \"repeated sexual assaults and sexual harassment against her.\" The other women are also alleging multiple sexual assaults, stretching back to at least 2007. The plaintiffs are represented by the law firm Harris & Hayden. The complaint says the women are also accusing Smokey Robinson of false imprisonment, emotional distress and gender violence. Allegations against both include emotional distress and illegal working conditions. Sponsor Message Robinson's attorney, Christopher Frost, sent a statement Thursday calling the allegations \"vile\" and \"false.\" \"This is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon,\" the statement read. At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, attorney John Harris called Smokey Robinson a \"serial assaulter\" and said the women kept quiet about the alleged misconduct out of fear, because they were low-wage workers \"living paycheck to paycheck\" and were \"intimidated\" by Robinson's celebrity. He also said the women were threatened, but did not specify the nature of the threats. The women are also being represented by Herbert Hayden. The women's attorneys are seeking a total of $50 million in damages. They say the women have not yet filed police reports. As the former frontman of The Miracles, Robinson, who is 85, is responsible for some of Motown's biggest hits including \"The Tears of a Clown\" and \"I Second That Emotion.\" Robinson eventually became Motown Records' vice president.

The complaint says the four, unnamed women were housekeepers of the Robinsons at the time of the alleged misconduct. Robinson's wife Frances Robinson is also named. Law Harvey Weinstein's trial is underway in Manhattan The complaint alleges that Jane Doe 1, who was a housekeeper for the Robinsons from January 2023 to February 2024, was forced to resign due to Smokey Robinson's \"repeated sexual assaults and sexual harassment against her.\" The other women are also alleging multiple sexual assaults, stretching back to at least 2007. The plaintiffs are represented by the law firm Harris & Hayden. The complaint says the women are also accusing Smokey Robinson of false imprisonment, emotional distress and gender violence. Allegations against both include emotional distress and illegal working conditions. Sponsor Message Robinson's attorney, Christopher Frost, sent a statement Thursday calling the allegations \"vile\" and \"false.\" \"This is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon,\" the statement read. At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, attorney John Harris called Smokey Robinson a \"serial assaulter\" and said the women kept quiet about the alleged misconduct out of fear, because they were low-wage workers \"living paycheck to paycheck\" and were \"intimidated\" by Robinson's celebrity. He also said the women were threatened, but did not specify the nature of the threats. The women are also being represented by Herbert Hayden. The women's attorneys are seeking a total of $50 million in damages. They say the women have not yet filed police reports. As the former frontman of The Miracles, Robinson, who is 85, is responsible for some of Motown's biggest hits including \"The Tears of a Clown\" and \"I Second That Emotion.\" Robinson eventually became Motown Records' vice president.

I was born in June of 1997 on Long Island to two incredibly supportive parents who always encouraged me to strive for excellence. From a young age, I was deeply interested in entrepreneurship. At the age of 12, I began shadowing my father as he ran his small business, instilling in me the values of hard work, respect, and integrity. After high school, he entrusted me with the responsibility of taking over his role.

If the mayor in your city is a member of the city council and there's a city manager appointed to handle the day-to-day administration of the city government, what do you believe should be the mayor's top priority in office? If the mayor's role is to serve on the city council while a city manager handles daily operations, the mayor's top priority should be setting the vision and direction for the city. This includes working with the council to establish clear priorities that reflect the needs and desires of the community, such as economic development, public safety, and infrastructure improvements. The mayor should also focus on building strong relationships with both the city manager and the public to ensure that the council's policies are effectively implemented and that the community is engaged and informed. If the mayor in your city is not a member of the city council and oversees the day-to-day administration of the city government, what do you believe is the ideal relationship between the mayor and city council? The ideal relationship between the mayor and the city council should be one of collaboration and mutual respect. While the mayor oversees the day-to-day administration, the city council is responsible for setting policies and making legislative decisions. The mayor should work closely with the council to ensure that the administration effectively implements the council's policies. Open communication is key, with regular updates and discussions to align on goals and address any challenges. Both the mayor and the council should see themselves as partners working toward the same objective: improving the quality of life for all residents in the city. What do you love most about your city? What I love most about my city is the diversity and resilience of its people. We come from all walks of life, bringing together a rich tapestry of cultures, ideas, and traditions that make our city vibrant and unique. Despite challenges, there’s a strong sense of community and a shared determination to build a better future for everyone. The energy of the city is inspiring, and it’s this blend of diversity, culture, and unwavering spirit that makes me proud to call it home. What do you perceive to be your city's greatest challenges over the next decade? Over the next decade, I perceive that our city's greatest challenges will include affordable housing, as the cost of living continues to rise, making it difficult for many to find stable and affordable homes. Public safety will also remain a key concern, requiring ongoing efforts to reduce crime and improve trust between law enforcement and the community. Additionally, infrastructure modernization will be critical to support a growing population and adapt to climate change, ensuring our city is resilient and prepared for the future. Finally, economic inequality will need to be addressed, as we strive to create more opportunities and reduce disparities across our neighborhoods. What do you believe is the ideal relationship between your city and the state government? The ideal relationship between our city and the state government should be one of partnership and collaboration. The city should have the autonomy to address local issues, while the state provides support, resources, and guidance when needed. Both levels of government should work together to align on broader goals, such as economic development, public safety, and infrastructure improvements, ensuring that policies are effective and benefit all residents. Regular communication and mutual respect are key to making this partnership successful, allowing us to address challenges together and create a thriving environment for our citizens. What do you believe is the ideal relationship between your city and the federal government? The ideal relationship between our city and the federal government should be based on cooperation and mutual support. The federal government should provide resources, funding, and guidance on national issues that impact our city, such as infrastructure, public health, and security. In turn, the city should implement federal policies in a way that best serves our local community while also having the flexibility to address unique local challenges. Open communication and collaboration are essential, ensuring that the needs of our residents are met while contributing to the broader national goals.

    "text": "should be based on trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. The mayor should support law enforcement by ensuring they have the resources and training needed to effectively protect and serve the community. At the same time, the mayor must hold law enforcement accountable to the highest standards of integrity and transparency. Regular communication is key to aligning on public safety goals and addressing community concerns. By working together, the mayor’s office and law enforcement can build a safer, more just city for all residents. What are your views on financial transparency and government accountability? Financial transparency and government accountability are fundamental to building and maintaining public trust. I believe that every dollar spent by the government should be accounted for and made visible to the public. This transparency ensures that resources are being used effectively and prevents corruption or misuse of funds. Moreover, government officials must be held accountable for their decisions and actions, ensuring that they serve the public interest with integrity. A government that is both transparent and accountable is essential for a healthy democracy, as it empowers citizens to make informed decisions and holds leaders responsible for their commitments.
