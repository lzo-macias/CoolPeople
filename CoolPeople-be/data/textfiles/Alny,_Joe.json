This is about one year earlier than the idea of a professor from Harvard University who suggested building an economic unity, called “Chimerica.” (Now I give up this idea of building a \"United China\" to replace the People's Republic of China, but separate China into 10 or 40 countries. This is also a good way for Chinese people to learn about the top civilizations of this world.) * In 2007, when I studied the MPA program at Troy University, AL, I suggested building a political unity, called “Amechina”, to unite America and China into one nation.

This is also a good way for Chinese people to learn about the top civilizations of this world.) “Amechina” is a Chinese style of respecting America more, but in the American way, it should be “Chimerica.” However, the Chinese think “Chimerica” is considered to respect China more. So “Chimerica” may be accepted by both sides, but it means different. it is tricky, Haha. Ask an American interpreter, she/he will agree and smile. But the problem is the interpreter is not a diplomat. An American diplomat is not a Chinese interpreter. When communist China is not a big issue it may not seem important too much, however, when communism becomes the biggest threat to our country and this world, an American politician who knows Chinese communism seems very important. That’s why I seek to serve our nation. We don’t have too much time. Waiting just means more and more costs in the future. If President Biden said he wouldn’t leave “withdraw from Afghanistan to another president,” why not say he won’t leave defeated Communist to another president? Yes, he can. He just doesn’t know communists very well and can’t find the most efficient way to beat them. “Amechina” is a Chinese style of respecting America more, but in the American way, it should be “Chimerica.” However, the Chinese think “Chimerica” is considered to respect China more.

As you know, I'm running for NYC mayor in 2025 as a Republican. Though it's next year, I'm not famous and not rich, and I only have an intelligent mind, so to win the campaign, we need to do extra jobs. That's why I work until 1am or 2 am sometimes. I'm interested in meeting all 3 people or any of them. In-person is the best, and Zoom is also ok. The secretary did a good job. She expressed it very accurately, haha. If the meetings are scheduled, I should go to D.C. to visit them, but the campaign is busy. I prefer to meet any or all of them in New York. You and they are probably concerned about why I'm interested in meeting them, right? The reasons are as follows. Thanks for your prompt response.

You and they are probably concerned about why I'm interested in meeting them, right? The reasons are as follows. Since Giovanni da Verrazzano first landed in NY harbor in 1524, NYC has had 110 mayors. I am most concerned with 2 Mayors, the first one is Fiorello H. La Guardia, the 99th mayor who served from 1934-1945, and the second one is Ed Koch, the 105th mayor, who served from 1978-1989.

La Guardia, the 99th mayor who served from 1934-1945, and the second one is Ed Koch, the 105th mayor, who served from 1978-1989. ​ ​ La Guardia Ranked #1 from his time until 1933 according to the survey among scholars and experts in politics and other industries. He is the best mayor of the big cities in U.S. history. Many New Yorkers may not know he was a mayor, though go in and out of LaGuardia airport many times. If I am elected, I will go to the Bronx to visit La Guardia's cemetery. Let him know, at least a New Yorker in 2026 will still remember him. And I will start a journey after Eric Admas in 2026, make NYC the best ever, like La Guardia did for New Yorkers. I have lived in NYC for more than 15 years. I have plans for NYC, but I need experts like you to verify them and at the same time give me some suggestions.

So, NYC seeks for some foundational or universal changes to make it to welcome a New Times, the best ever. The problems we are going to solve are not only troubled New Yorkers but also the whole nation of our country. We need some changes like on Aug 2nd, 1776, what happened in Philadelphia affected our nation. That required intelligence and faith as our founding fathers had. I'm confident that, as a group, we can do it. The founding fathers did great, but time changed, their shadows protected us from suffering under scorching summer sunlight, but now it's late afternoon and their shadows stopped us from seeing the sun, the truth, the fact, and the beautiful view of this Earth. We need new regulations. Our law system created criminals, our politics created short-view politicians, and our education teaches no future no hope students. It's not about more police in security, healthier politicians in politics, or more education money, but the foundational rules need to be changed in our everyday lives, we still need the same values and principles we believe as our ancestors did. We need to stop fighting but that needs powerful persuadable ideas and a trustable leadership team. It's no use or evil just to shout to unite or stop fighting with a stupid or short-view idea or team. That can only lead to laughter, neglect, or disobedience. And that's the situation now we have.
