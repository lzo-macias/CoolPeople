Saint Jermaine Endeley is a 21-year-old NYU student, and he’s running for the Democratic nomination for the State Senate seat in Staten Island and Brooklyn. A self-described “pro-business Democrat” and creator of a his own 5–5–5 economic stimulus plan , Endeley’s taking a farther right stance than opponent, 4-term incumbent Democrat Sen. Diane Savino. As of the night of December 12th, his Facebook is up to 56 likes (it was at 15 last week ), and he is sporting three times as many fuzzy profile pictures as before. We e-mailed Endeley about his campaign, balancing NYU, and dining halls. He responded with two LOLs and a press release. What made you decide to run now? Well I simply felt like the time was now. I am looking at the way politicians behave today and it honestly makes me sick sometimes. There are so many important issues to be dealt with and here we are fighting over petty politics in both Washington and Albany. Politicians cannot even pass budgets and government can’t pay it’s bills. You see members of Congress insider trading and Governors selling U.S Senate seats. I feel like the last generation has dealt 90’s babies tough cards to play and we do not have many options. And I feel like a generational change in all levels of government might be what is necessary to restore some sense of responsibility. Do you think your age or student status will be a factor going forward in the campaign? I think it will for some folks. I think it will be a positive factor for others. I am not the only young person in NYC politics who has successfully run for office. You have Eric Ulrich of Queens who was 23. David Carlucci upstate who was 22. And even Teddy Roosevelt was 18. I think if I have the issues and facts on my side I’ll be okay. Plus it’s my hometown, everyone knows me from my high school years. I’ve read that the incumbent, Sen. Diane Savino, has a deep fundraising bank. How are you planning on competing with that? It will be hard. Going against any incumbent is hard. But I cannot let that discourage or intimate me. [Note: in a later e-mail, Endeley said he meant “intimidate.”] I am going to have to see if grass roots and small dollar fundraising can still get the job done in the age of “Citizens United”. I think with the power of social media and good public policy, I can encourage people that I will be a better choice. But she will no doubt raise way more money than me. Unless NYU students want to help me raise small donations? LOL Why are you running to the right of Savino? Well thats just where I am on the issues. I will let the media determine if it is the right or left. I am no doubt a pro business Democrat. I think you would have to be crazy not to be in this economy. I am naturally a fiscal conservative- I think government should live within it’s means. People are going to label me as anti Labor but that is not true. How could I be when my mom is in a labor union that is the reason she is still even employed. I just think sometimes they over reach on policy issues here in NYC and I only want to be an honest broker between all interests. I also think government should be efficient and limited to a certain extent. However I do believe government has a role to play in economics and solving the hardships of poverty. There just has to be a mutual responsibility between society and the individual. I occupied Wall street because their culture of greed crashed the economy and some still do not take full responsibility. But I do not think we should end, over regulate, or over tax America’s economic engine. I just think there needs to be some new rules of the road. Not only for wall Street but for everybody. Why should we vote for you? Im not sure how many of you live in my district but you should help campaign LOL. I say that because my election is more significant than me or even the policies I believe in. It is about a generational frustration with how politics"

I am the most honest politician you can choose from. How can you campaign and be an NYU student at the same time? I wont be. I took a leave of absence and will return if I lose. If I win, I can also still finish- I’m not that far from graduation. The position is technically part-time. Most members of the New York Legislature make millions running businesses and law firms when they are not in session. If they can do that, I think I can handle a few courses here and there until I’m done. Last question: Upstein or Downstein? YOU MUST DECIDE. Upstein dude. Who can deny Chik-Fil-A… Later, he e-mailed us a press release, noting various disappointments with Cuomo’s money distribution and the lack of attendence of Sen. Savino at regional economic distribution meetings. However, he does have big dreams for Staten Island: “We could use a nice Imax Theater in St. George among many other development ideas on the table for the north shore. I am glad we got the park in Fresh Kills. I can’t wait to take a jog in the summer and go out for a kayak with my friends.” Endeley also hopes for the legalization of “non-Indian Casinos and outer borough pick ups for livery cabs” as both are great for the NYC economy.

They include: a primary election, including a caucus or convention that has authority to select a nominee; a general election; a runoff election; and a special election held to fill a vacant seat. 11 CFR 100.2 . Election cycle The period beginning the day after the previous general election for a given federal office and ending on the date of the general election for that office. The number of years in an election cycle differs according to the federal office sought. The election cycle spans two years for House candidates; four years for presidential candidates; and six years for Senate candidates. See 11 CFR 100.3(b) . Electioneering communication Any broadcast, cable or satellite communication that (1) refers to a clearly identified candidate for federal office; (2) is publicly distributed within certain time periods before an election and (3) is targeted to the relevant electorate. 11 CFR 100.29 . Employer The organization or person by whom an individual is employed, and not the name of his or her supervisor. 11 CFR 100.21 . Ending cash on hand The total amount of cash on hand that remains after the amount of cash on hand at the beginning of the reporting period is adjusted to add the total receipts for the reporting period and subtract the total disbursements for the reporting period. Executive and administrative personnel Individuals employed by a corporation or labor organization who are paid on a salary rather than hourly basis and who have policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities. The definition does not include professionals who are represented by a labor organization, salaried foremen and lower-level supervisors having direct supervision over hourly employees, former or retired personnel who are not stockholders, and consultants who are not employees under the Internal Revenue Code. 11 CFR 114.1(c) , 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-1 . Exempt party activities Certain candidate support activities that state and local party groups may undertake without making a contribution or expenditure, provided specific rules are followed.

A written agreement to make an expenditure is also considered an expenditure. 11 CFR 100.111 and 100.112 . Expenditure report period In the case of a major party, the expenditure report period begins on September 1 before the election or on the date on which the major party’s presidential nominee is chosen, whichever is earlier; and the period ends 30 days after the presidential election. In the case of a minor or new party, the period will be the same as that of the major party with the shortest expenditure report period. See 11 CFR 9002.12 . Express advocacy Unambiguously advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate. There are two ways that a communication can be defined as express advocacy (candidate advocacy): by use of certain “explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat” and by the “only reasonable interpretation” test. See 11 CFR 100.22 . Facilitation The use of corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election (other than raising funds for the organization’s separate segregated fund). Facilitation results in a prohibited contribution to the committee that benefits from the activity. 11 CFR 114.2(f) . Family For purposes of candidate travel rules, \"immediate family\" means the father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, spouse (see separate definition), father-in-law or mother-in-law of the candidate. See 11 CFR 100.93(g)(4) . For purposes of rules governing SSF solicitations and corporate/labor communications, \"families\" includes spouses (see separate definition), mothers, fathers, sons and daughters who live in the same household.
