I am very proud to have served our great country as a United States Marine during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). I am a retired sergeant with the New York Police Department (NYPD) who has served in various positions throughout my career, from investigative ranks to public relations to supervisory positions. After my NYPD career, I went back to college to attain a Master’s degree in Social Work and currently am a Licensed Master Social Worker serving as a psychotherapist. I believe my experience is unique. I hope this glimpse demonstrates how I will fight, problem-solve, and collaborate with any persons who will allow us to reach these objectives together. I also come from a working-class family, a father, and husband looking for those same goals to leave my children in a stronger community. And a better NYC.
