    "text": "Printer Friendly Woman Sentenced In Manhattan Federal Court For “Water Park For Foster Kids” Fraud Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that LILIANA TRAFFICANTE was sentenced this morning in Manhattan federal court by U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts to 41 months in prison for her leadership role in a five-year scheme to obtain money from investors by claiming that the money would be used for a project intended to help foster children, when in fact TRAFFICANTE spent much of the money on personal expenses and other purposes. TRAFFICANTE pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2010, and agreed to pay restitution to the victims of her offense, pursuant to a plan to be set by the Court. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “Instead of developing water parks for foster children as she said she would, Liliana Trafficante used the money to support her own lifestyle. In doing so, she exploited a worthy cause for personal gain, cheating foster kids out of an opportunity to truly benefit from the investors’ contributions.” According to the charging documents in the case and statements made in open court today at the sentencing proceeding: LILIANA TRAFFICANTE held herself out as the founder and Chief Executive Officer of International Dreams, a Manhattan-based entity. In addition, she is the principal of, or otherwise affiliated with, a number of entities that appear to be related to International Dreams, including GoOcean Park and Resort LLC, Bouchville Manors, The Little Water Park That Could, and Signature A (collectively, the “Trafficante Entities”). TRAFFICANTE claimed to be raising money for the purchase of land and completion of a water park for foster children (the “Water Park Project”). Among other methods, TRAFFICANTE raised money through postings on the Craigslist website. TRAFFICANTE made numerous false statements to individuals in order to induce them to make loans to and/or investments in the Trafficante Entities. For example, according to the Complaint, TRAFFICANTE told one individual that land had been located for the Water Park Project. TRAFFICANTE claimed that the land was rich with natural resources, the exploration of which prior to construction could help fund the Water Park Project. Based on these representations, the individual loaned $100,000 to one of the Trafficante Entities. In connection with this loan, TRAFFICANTE and this individual executed a promissory note that stated that the “purpose” of the $100,000 loan was to help “GoOcean Water Park & Resort purchase excavating equipment.” In fact, no land had been purchased by TRAFFICANTE for a water park, or for any other purpose, and the money was not used for equipment of any kind. Rather, among other non-equipment payments, TRAFFICANTE made $40,000 in rent payments on behalf of family members the same day that the $100,000 was wired to an account she controlled. * * * In addition to the prison term, Judge Batts sentenced TRAFFICANTE to three years of supervised release. TRAFFICANTE also was ordered to pay restitution of $750,000, as well as a $100 special assessment fee. Mr. Bharara praised the work of the FBI, which investigated this case. Today’s announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys’ offices and state and local partners, it’s the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since the inception of FFETF in November 2009, the Justice Department has filed more than 12,841 financial fraud cases against nearly 18,737 defendants including nearly 3,500 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov . This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Ingoglia is in charge of the prosecution. 14-177 Return to Top"

Batts to 41 months in prison for her leadership role in a five-year scheme to obtain money from investors by claiming that the money would be used for a project intended to help foster children, when in fact TRAFFICANTE spent much of the money on personal expenses and other purposes. TRAFFICANTE pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2010, and agreed to pay restitution to the victims of her offense, pursuant to a plan to be set by the Court. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “Instead of developing water parks for foster children as she said she would, Liliana Trafficante used the money to support her own lifestyle. In doing so, she exploited a worthy cause for personal gain, cheating foster kids out of an opportunity to truly benefit from the investors’ contributions.” According to the charging documents in the case and statements made in open court today at the sentencing proceeding: LILIANA TRAFFICANTE held herself out as the founder and Chief Executive Officer of International Dreams, a Manhattan-based entity. In addition, she is the principal of, or otherwise affiliated with, a number of entities that appear to be related to International Dreams, including GoOcean Park and Resort LLC, Bouchville Manors, The Little Water Park That Could, and Signature A (collectively, the “Trafficante Entities”). TRAFFICANTE claimed to be raising money for the purchase of land and completion of a water park for foster children (the “Water Park Project”). Among other methods, TRAFFICANTE raised money through postings on the Craigslist website. TRAFFICANTE made numerous false statements to individuals in order to induce them to make loans to and/or investments in the Trafficante Entities. For example, according to the Complaint, TRAFFICANTE told one individual that land had been located for the Water Park Project. TRAFFICANTE claimed that the land was rich with natural resources, the exploration of which prior to construction could help fund the Water Park Project. Based on these representations, the individual loaned $100,000 to one of the Trafficante Entities. In connection with this loan, TRAFFICANTE and this individual executed a promissory note that stated that the “purpose” of the $100,000 loan was to help “GoOcean Water Park & Resort purchase excavating equipment.” In fact, no land had been purchased by TRAFFICANTE for a water park, or for any other purpose, and the money was not used for equipment of any kind. Rather, among other non-equipment payments, TRAFFICANTE made $40,000 in rent payments on behalf of family members the same day that the $100,000 was wired to an account she controlled. In addition to the prison term, Judge Batts sentenced TRAFFICANTE to three years of supervised release. TRAFFICANTE also was ordered to pay restitution of $750,000, as well as a $100 special assessment fee. Mr. Bharara praised the work of the FBI, which investigated this case. Today’s announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys’ offices and state and local partners, it’s the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since the inception of FFETF in November 2009, the Justice Department has filed more than 12,841 financial fraud cases against nearly 18,737 defendants including nearly 3,500 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov . This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.

Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since the inception of FFETF in November 2009, the Justice Department has filed more than 12,841 financial fraud cases against nearly 18,737 defendants including nearly 3,500 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov . This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Ingoglia is in charge of the prosecution.

Liliana Trafficante, 58, announced her campaign earlier this month on Instagram , writing that her sudden calling for public service was driven by there being “no help” for her “hurting community.” Liliana Trafficante is running for a Bronx City Council seat after spending years locked up in federal prison. AP The Country Club resident’s longest-shot candidacy comes just over a decade after she pled guilty to felony wire fraud conspiracy, having bilked investors in a fictitious plan to build a waterpark on 120 acres in Goshen, according to Justice Department officials . Trafficante was sentenced to nearly three years in federal prison and ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution to her victims, of which she’s coughed up just $118, according to Manhattan federal court records.

Liliana Trafficante, 58, announced her campaign earlier this month on Instagram , writing that her sudden calling for public service was driven by there being “no help” for her “hurting community.” Liliana Trafficante is running for a Bronx City Council seat after spending years locked up in federal prison. AP The Country Club resident’s longest-shot candidacy comes just over a decade after she pled guilty to felony wire fraud conspiracy, having bilked investors in a fictitious plan to build a waterpark on 120 acres in Goshen, according to Justice Department officials . Trafficante was sentenced to nearly three years in federal prison and ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution to her victims, of which she’s coughed up just $118, according to Manhattan federal court records.

The political neophyte claims she’s pursuing a seat in the Bronx’s 13th District, which is currently repped by freshmen Republican Kristy Marmorato and covers Country Club and Throggs Neck, although she erroneously filed paperwork to run in Manhattan’s 3rd District.

The law faces a challenge in Manhattan Supreme Court. Trafficante has received zero donations, according to city campaign finance records. The wannabe pol, who currently works for government services company Maximus, insisted her time in the clink makes her the ideal representative for her nabe. “I just want to serve and make this community better, and I think that if you have lived the problem, you’re better suited,” she said.

Trafficante conducted a five-year scheme to defraud investors by falsely claiming that their money would be used to build a water park to benefit foster children. She secured more than $1 million in loans and investments, then spent much of the money on personal expenses and to repay others who had given her money for the project. Win Morrison, broker for Green Lake Resort in Catskill, which Trafficante claimed she was going to buy, had mixed feelings about her guilty plea. \"I think that if that's the only thing they could get her on, that's a shame,\" he said. \"The lady has ruined more lives than anyone else that I know.\" Morrison said Trafficante strung his clients and him along for more than a year. She signed a contract to buy the property. But she didn't have the money. She continued to express interest in the property right up through May, about the time she met with two FBI agents in a Manhattan diner. Morrison said he even lent her money a few times to get her out of a couple of difficult situations. She never repaid him. Green Lake Resort was only the last in a long line of such false promises. Before coming to Goshen, Trafficante pursued sites in Chester and Woodbury, as well as one near Lake Placid, in each case failing to come up with the money to buy the land. In September 2007, she made a $14 million offer on another site, 120 acres in Goshen, but never went to contract on that, either. \"She could never come up with money for the closing,\" said Ed Arace, a partner in landowner 124 Goshen Partners. \"We eventually just cut her off completely.\" In another case, Trafficante told an investor that land which had been located for the water park project was rich with natural resources, and that the exploration of the land before construction could help fund the water park. The investor lent $100,000 to one of Trafficante's businesses. Trafficante made $40,000 in rent payments the same day the $100,000 was wired to her account. Trafficante faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. As part of her plea agreement, she also agreed to pay restitution to her victims.

    "text": "BUSINESS Trafficante gets jail for bilking investors Jessica DiNapoli NEW YORK — Liliana Trafficante was sentenced Tuesday to three years and five months in prison for misleading investors in a $120 million Goshen water park project that she said would help children transition out of foster care. Before her sentencing in U.S. District Court on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Trafficante, a self-described crusader for kids, apologized for the scheme. She raised about $1 million from investors for the water park, but spent much of it on personal expenses, including rent for family members. She said it was a \"mistake in judgment,\" and that she acted out of fear. \"I know I'm a different person,\" said Trafficante, who is now blond. Trafficante recently served 14 months for impersonating an official from a children's nonprofit to steal close to $10,000 in groceries. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. She has already served seven months on the federal fraud charge related to the water park scheme, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Ingoglia said the fraud was \"particularly reprehensible\" because she didn't just attract investors with high returns. \"What was being preyed on, what was being abused, was people's desire to help,\" he said. The Goshen water park project, called GoOcean, promised to create jobs and provide housing for children making the transition out of foster care. Trafficante came to Goshen after scoping sites in Lake Placid, Woodbury and Chester. About six years ago, she announced numerous closing dates for the purchase of the Goshen site, located behind the Eastgate office park just off Exit 124 on Route 17, but never finalized the deal. She was charged with fraud and pleaded guilty in 2010. Her sentencing had been pushed back for more than three years. The delay came from trying to figure out Trafficante's relationship with her son, said U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts. It turns out there is no legal relationship between the two, she said. Trafficante said in court she can be a \"good mother\" to the boy. Her attorney, John Meringolo, said a psychiatric evaluation showed she suffered from \"narcissistic behaviors.\" \"I'm not saying she's an angel,\" Meringolo said, asking Batts to take the diagnosis into consideration during sentencing. Ingoglia said that many people who take other people's money are narcissistic in some way. Trafficante was also ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution. Ingoglia said it was unlikely victims would get any money back. John Minardi of Queens, one of Trafficante's victims, showed up in court Tuesday. He made an initial investment of $30,000 with her, and sent thousands more after she showed him documents that looked legitimate. She told him he would be the site engineer for the water park, a job similar to the one he currently holds. He paid for a flyover of the Goshen site in a plane. \"It looked good,\" he said. \"Other people believed it just as much as I did.\" jdinapoli@th-record.com Trafficante gets jail for bilking investors NEW YORK — Liliana Trafficante was sentenced Tuesday to three years and five months in prison for misleading investors in a $120 million Goshen water park project that she said would help children transition out of foster care.
