Martinez has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Rolling pipe centering apparatus Patent number: 4624637 Abstract: When pipes 8 are rollingly conveyed through a furnace along parallel rails 7, any lateral migrations of the pipes are periodically corrected by movable stops 18 which are extended inwardly in unison to abut the pipe ends and re-center them. The stops are mounted on elbowed arms 14 articulated about axes 15 disposed beneath the furnace bed together with fluid control cylinders 16 for the arms, thus providing unobstructed access around the side walls 2 of the furnace. The pipes roll over elevated slide runners 11 during their lateral re-centering by the stops, thereby avoiding the wear and abrasion of the rail crowns. Type: Grant Filed: September 9, 1985 Date of Patent: November 25, 1986 Assignee: Pont-A-Mousson S.A. Inventors: Rene Genesio, Jean P.
