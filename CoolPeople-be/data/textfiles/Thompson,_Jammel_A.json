Okporo is Abreu’s main challenger. He’s a passionate advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and refugees . Originally from Nigeria, Okporo has written extensively on both subjects, drawing from his own experiences. His platform includes strengthening tenant protections, holding Columbia University accountable to its community benefits agreement, strengthening the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) program, addressing gun violence, fully funding mental health resources, defending immigrant and worker rights, and universal childcare. “New York must be a city that protects its people, not one that pushes them aside. As an immigrant, an activist, and a community leader, I have fought for policies that uphold dignity, fairness, and opportunity for all,” said Okporo. “Now, I’m ready to take that fight to City Hall. Our campaign is about ensuring middle-class families can afford to stay in their homes, guaranteeing retirees the healthcare they deserve, and making our neighborhoods safer without criminalizing poverty. In the face of fear and division, we will stand united — for an NYC that works for all of us.” He’s raised $35,861 in private funds and received $117,055 in public funds . Ashman is a lifelong resident in Crown Heights, who was born of Caribbean immigrant parents. His platform focuses on eight critical issues: reducing crime and deed theft, open streets plan for the district, tackling the affordability crisis, enforcing equitable zoning laws, creating wealth building opportunities and employment, enforcing fair share provisions in the City Charter, and advocating on behalf of the district. He’s raised $29,516 in private funds and an impressive $115,748 in public funds. “I am campaigning for the 35th City Council position because we require and deserve stronger representation than what we currently receive from our incumbent representative- representation that reflects the true value of our collective hard earned tax dollars,” said Ashman.

She was first elected in 2021. She’s raised $36,896 in private funds for her reelection campaign, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB). Pieters has raised $26,380 and Daniels has raised $5,257 in private funds. District 28 – Tyrell D. Hankerson, Romeo Hitlall, Latoya LeGrand, Japneet Singh District 28’s race in Queens is unique because City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is term-limited this year, leaving an opening for her council seat and a new Speaker . Several candidates have tossed their hat in the ring to replace Adams, including her Chief of Staff Tyrell “Ty” Hankerson . “This district isn’t new to me. It’s my home, and I have lived in every corner of it,” said Hankerson. “I have spent several years working on the issues that matter most to the people of this community, including affordability, public safety, education, quality of life, responsible development, and environmental justice. I seek to unite this community because we are ONE DISTRICT 28, and I will be a Councilmember that serves everyone. Together, we can build real solutions that ensure no one is overlooked and every voice is heard.” RELATED: The Rundown 2025: Big Races to Watch Hankerson’s platform is focused on addressing issues like affordable housing, ensuring public safety with accountability, improving the quality of education, advancing responsible development, and tackling environmental justice.

Contributed by her campaign. “I am honored to run for reelection to represent the residents of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, and Clinton Hill in the New York City Council,” said Hudson. “Four years ago, I first ran for the Council to give back to a community that has given so much to me.” In her time in office, she has passed bills to lay the groundwork for free or low-cost childcare, bolster access to doula and midwife care to address the Black maternal mortality crisis, provide direct cash assistance to our city’s most marginalized residents, and expand NYPD accountability. She’s also helped restore significant funding to beloved institutions like libraries and cultural organizations. Her reelection platform includes fighting for deeply affordable housing, supporting community-led gun violence interrupters, enacting universal childcare, defending immigrant communities, expanding protections for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers, and creating an accessible city for older adults. Hudson has raised $69,624 in private funds and $129,694 in public funds . Robertson, one of her main challengers, ran in the 2021 city council elections in a packed district race and ultimately lost to Hudson. For over 20 years, Robertson has worked as a community organizer with the Washington Avenue Botanic Block Association (WABBA) and the Crown Heights Community Council (CHCC). He is a fierce advocate for older adults and tenants rights, he said. He’s raised $3,975 in private funds. Ashman is a lifelong resident in Crown Heights, who was born of Caribbean immigrant parents. His platform focuses on eight critical issues: reducing crime and deed theft, open streets plan for the district, tackling the affordability crisis, enforcing equitable zoning laws, creating wealth building opportunities and employment, enforcing fair share provisions in the City Charter, and advocating on behalf of the district. He’s raised $29,516 in private funds and an impressive $115,748 in public funds. “I am campaigning for the 35th City Council position because we require and deserve stronger representation than what we currently receive from our incumbent representative- representation that reflects the true value of our collective hard earned tax dollars,” said Ashman.

She was first elected to represent District 41 from 2006 to 2017. In 2021, she won again, reclaiming her old city council seat. So far she’s raised $11,500 in private funds for yet another reelection campaign. Many of her challengers are passionate advocates albeit not well funded. Henderson is the NYC Regional Board Chair at Citizen Action and currently a doctoral candidate. He proudly hails from the Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn. “I am pursuing this office to be the next Councilmember of the 41st district of Brooklyn because over 140,000 registered voters in this beautiful district are awaiting that authentic leader who will see ALL neighborhoods in the district and deliver through FUNDING, POLICIES, AND RESOURCES,” said Henderson in a statement. Cunningham was raised by a tight knit family that has deep roots in Harlem. She has worked as a union and community organizer building coalitions around issues such as worker safety, increasing wages and flexibility for workers, securing equity and resources for public school students, and public safety. “I am seeking to represent the 41st district and have a proven record of having political courage to stand with the many to fight for a New York that is clean, safe, and affordable for all,” said Cunningham. “A New York that prioritizes the dignity of our retirees, essential workers, and public servants. I pledge to fight corruption and special interests conspiring to diminish the great promise of this city and our democracy.” Lawman’s motto"

This year kicks off a slew of city council elections, with quite a few candidates facing off with Black incumbents in their respective districts. Upping the spice factor to 2025 city council elections is the element of Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)– where instead of choosing only one favorite candidate, voters rank up to five candidates in each race–in this year’s June primary. Based on New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB) info from this January, here’s the candidates for competitive races and funds they’ve raised so far. District 7- Incumbent Shaun Abreu, Edafe Okporo Abreu’s district covers the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill, and Washington Heights in Manhattan. Prior to getting elected to office in 2021, he was a tenant rights attorney. He’s been awarded $174,562 in public funds by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB). “New Yorkers don’t back down from a fight, and neither do I,” said Abreu. “In the last three years, I’ve led on affordable housing and tenant rights, gotten trash bags off our sidewalks, and passed worker protection laws that are a model for the nation. I secured unprecedented levels of funding for parks, fought for our libraries, and expanded access to mental health services. Now, I’m running for reelection to keep up the momentum and create lasting change.” Sign up for our FREE acclaimed newsletters! The news mainstream media just doesn't cover.

Okporo is Abreu’s main challenger. He’s a passionate advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and refugees . Originally from Nigeria, Okporo has written extensively on both subjects, drawing from his own experiences. His platform includes strengthening tenant protections, holding Columbia University accountable to its community benefits agreement, strengthening the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) program, addressing gun violence, fully funding mental health resources, defending immigrant and worker rights, and universal childcare. “New York must be a city that protects its people,"

This year kicks off a slew of city council elections, with quite a few candidates facing off with Black incumbents in their respective districts. Upping the spice factor to 2025 city council elections is the element of Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)– where instead of choosing only one favorite candidate, voters rank up to five candidates in each race–in this year’s June primary. Based on New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB) info from this January, here’s the candidates for competitive races and funds they’ve raised so far. District 7- Incumbent Shaun Abreu, Edafe Okporo Abreu’s district covers the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill, and Washington Heights in Manhattan. Prior to getting elected to office in 2021, he was a tenant rights attorney. He’s been awarded $174,562 in public funds by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB). “New Yorkers don’t back down from a fight, and neither do I,” said Abreu. “In the last three years, I’ve led on affordable housing and tenant rights, gotten trash bags off our sidewalks, and passed worker protection laws that are a model for the nation. I secured unprecedented levels of funding for parks, fought for our libraries, and expanded access to mental health services.

Okporo is Abreu’s main challenger. He’s a passionate advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and refugees . Originally from Nigeria, Okporo has written extensively on both subjects, drawing from his own experiences. His platform includes strengthening tenant protections, holding Columbia University accountable to its community benefits agreement, strengthening the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) program, addressing gun violence, fully funding mental health resources, defending immigrant and worker rights, and universal childcare. “New York must be a city that protects its people,"

This year kicks off a slew of city council elections, with quite a few candidates facing off with Black incumbents in their respective districts. Upping the spice factor to 2025 city council elections is the element of Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)– where instead of choosing only one favorite candidate, voters rank up to five candidates in each race–in this year’s June primary. Based on New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB) info from this January, here’s the candidates for competitive races and funds they’ve raised so far. District 7- Incumbent Shaun Abreu, Edafe Okporo Abreu’s district covers the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill, and Washington Heights in Manhattan. Prior to getting elected to office in 2021, he was a tenant rights attorney. He’s been awarded $174,562 in public funds by the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB). “New Yorkers don’t back down from a fight, and neither do I,” said Abreu. “In the last three years, I’ve led on affordable housing and tenant rights, gotten trash bags off our sidewalks, and passed worker protection laws that are a model for the nation. I secured unprecedented levels of funding for parks, fought for our libraries, and expanded access to mental health services.

Okporo is Abreu’s main challenger. He’s a passionate advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and refugees . Originally from Nigeria, Okporo has written extensively on both subjects, drawing from his own experiences. His platform includes strengthening tenant protections, holding Columbia University accountable to its community benefits agreement, strengthening the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) program, addressing gun violence, fully funding mental health resources, defending immigrant and worker rights, and universal childcare. “New York must be a city that protects its people,"

As an immigrant, an activist, and a community leader, I have fought for policies that uphold dignity, fairness, and opportunity for all,” said Okporo. “Now, I’m ready to take that fight to City Hall.

Ashman is a lifelong resident in Crown Heights, who was born of Caribbean immigrant parents. His platform focuses on eight critical issues: reducing crime and deed theft, open streets plan for the district, tackling the affordability crisis, enforcing equitable zoning laws, creating wealth building opportunities and employment, enforcing fair share provisions in the City Charter, and advocating on behalf of the district. He’s raised $29,516 in private funds and an impressive $115,748 in public funds. “I am campaigning for the 35th City Council position because we require and deserve stronger representation than what we currently receive from our incumbent representative- representation that reflects the true value of our collective hard earned tax dollars,” said Ashman.

Pieters has raised $26,380 and Daniels has raised $5,257 in private funds. District 28 – Tyrell D. Hankerson, Romeo Hitlall, Latoya LeGrand, Japneet Singh District 28’s race in Queens is unique because City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is term-limited this year, leaving an opening for her council seat and a new Speaker . Several candidates have tossed their hat in the ring to replace Adams, including her Chief of Staff Tyrell “Ty” Hankerson . “This district isn’t new to me. It’s my home, and I have lived in every corner of it,” said Hankerson. “I have spent several years working on the issues that matter most to the people of this community, including affordability, public safety, education, quality of life, responsible development, and environmental justice. I seek to unite this community because we are ONE DISTRICT 28, and I will be a Councilmember that serves everyone. Together, we can build real solutions that ensure no one is overlooked and every voice is heard.” RELATED: The Rundown 2025: Big Races to Watch Hankerson’s platform is focused on addressing issues like affordable housing, ensuring public safety with accountability, improving the quality of education, advancing responsible development, and tackling environmental justice. He is also committed to expanding access to quality healthcare, supporting small businesses, and driving economic development across the district. So far he’s raised $25,141 in private funds and $82,445 in public funds. Other candidates in the race include Romeo Hitlall , a Community Board 10 member and real estate broker; LaToya LeGrand , a constituent services representative for Assemblymember Vivian Cook; and Japneet Singh , a Sikh social activist that ran for state senate in 2022. District 35 – Incumbent Crystal Hudson, Hector Robertson, Sharon Wedderburn, Dion M. Ashman “I am honored to run for reelection to represent the residents of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, and Clinton Hill in the New York City Council,” said Hudson. “Four years ago, I first ran for the Council to give back to a community that has given so much to me.” In her time in office, she has passed bills to lay the groundwork for free or low-cost childcare, bolster access to doula and midwife care to address the Black maternal mortality crisis, provide direct cash assistance to our city’s most marginalized residents, and expand NYPD accountability. She’s also helped restore significant funding to beloved institutions like libraries and cultural organizations. Her reelection platform includes fighting for deeply affordable housing, supporting community-led gun violence interrupters, enacting universal childcare, defending immigrant communities, expanding protections for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers, and creating an accessible city for older adults. Hudson has raised $69,624 in private funds and $129,694 in public funds .

As an immigrant, an activist, and a community leader, I have fought for policies that uphold dignity, fairness, and opportunity for all,” said Okporo. “Now, I’m ready to take that fight to City Hall. Our campaign is about ensuring middle-class families can afford to stay in their homes, guaranteeing retirees the healthcare they deserve, and making our neighborhoods safer without criminalizing poverty. In the face of fear and division, we will stand united — for an NYC that works for all of us.” He’s raised $35,861 in private funds and received $117,055 in public funds . Ashman is a lifelong resident in Crown Heights, who was born of Caribbean immigrant parents. His platform focuses on eight critical issues: reducing crime and deed theft, open streets plan for the district, tackling the affordability crisis, enforcing equitable zoning laws, creating wealth building opportunities and employment, enforcing fair share provisions in the City Charter, and advocating on behalf of the district. He’s raised $29,516 in private funds and an impressive $115,748 in public funds. “I am campaigning for the 35th City Council position because we require and deserve stronger representation than what we currently receive from our incumbent representative- representation that reflects the true value of our collective hard earned tax dollars,” said Ashman. District 27- Incumbent Nantasha Williams, Austin Pieters, Vera V. Daniels Williams’ district covers Jamaica, South Jamaica, Springfield Gardens, St. Albans, Hollis, Queens Village, Cambria Heights, and Laurelton in Queens. She was first elected in 2021. She’s raised $36,896 in private funds for her reelection campaign, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB). Pieters has raised $26,380 and Daniels has raised $5,257 in private funds. District 28 – Tyrell D. Hankerson, Romeo Hitlall, Latoya LeGrand, Japneet Singh District 28’s race in Queens is unique because City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is term-limited this year, leaving an opening for her council seat and a new Speaker . Several candidates have tossed their hat in the ring to replace Adams, including her Chief of Staff Tyrell “Ty” Hankerson . “This district isn’t new to me. It’s my home, and I have lived in every corner of it,” said Hankerson. “I have spent several years working on the issues that matter most to the people of this community, including affordability, public safety, education, quality of life, responsible development, and environmental justice. I seek to unite this community because we are ONE DISTRICT 28, and I will be a Councilmember that serves everyone. Together, we can build real solutions that ensure no one is overlooked and every voice is heard.” RELATED: The Rundown 2025: Big Races to Watch Hankerson’s platform is focused on addressing issues like affordable housing, ensuring public safety with accountability, improving the quality of education, advancing responsible development, and tackling environmental justice. He is also committed to expanding access to quality healthcare, supporting small businesses, and driving economic development across the district. So far he’s raised $25,141 in private funds and $82,445 in public funds. Other candidates in the race include Romeo Hitlall , a Community Board 10 member and real estate broker; LaToya LeGrand , a constituent services representative for Assemblymember Vivian Cook; and Japneet Singh , a Sikh social activist that ran for state senate in 2022. District 35 – Incumbent Crystal Hudson, Hector Robertson, Sharon Wedderburn, Dion M. Ashman “I am honored to run for reelection to represent the residents of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, and Clinton Hill in the New York City Council,” said Hudson. “Four years ago, I first ran for the Council to give back to a community that has given so much to me.” In her time in office, she has passed bills to lay the groundwork for free or low-cost childcare, bolster access to doula and midwife care to address the Black maternal mortality crisis, provide direct cash assistance to our city’s most marginalized residents, and expand NYPD accountability. She’s also helped restore significant funding to beloved institutions like libraries and cultural organizations. Her reelection platform includes fighting for deeply affordable housing, supporting community-led gun violence interrupters, enacting universal childcare, defending immigrant communities, expanding protections for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers, and creating an accessible city for older adults. Hudson has raised $69,624 in private funds and $129,694 in public funds .

Ashman “I am honored to run for reelection to represent the residents of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, and Clinton Hill in the New York City Council,” said Hudson. “Four years ago, I first ran for the Council to give back to a community that has given so much to me.” In her time in office, she has passed bills to lay the groundwork for free or low-cost childcare, bolster access to doula and midwife care to address the Black maternal mortality crisis, provide direct cash assistance to our city’s most marginalized residents, and expand NYPD accountability. She’s also helped restore significant funding to beloved institutions like libraries and cultural organizations. Her reelection platform includes fighting for deeply affordable housing, supporting community-led gun violence interrupters, enacting universal childcare, defending immigrant communities, expanding protections for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers, and creating an accessible city for older adults. Hudson has raised $69,624 in private funds and $129,694 in public funds .

He is a fierce advocate for older adults and tenants rights, he said. He’s raised $3,975 in private funds. Ashman is a lifelong resident in Crown Heights, who was born of Caribbean immigrant parents. His platform focuses on eight critical issues: reducing crime and deed theft, open streets plan for the district, tackling the affordability crisis, enforcing equitable zoning laws, creating wealth building opportunities and employment, enforcing fair share provisions in the City Charter, and advocating on behalf of the district. He’s raised $29,516 in private funds and an impressive $115,748 in public funds. “I am campaigning for the 35th City Council position because we require and deserve stronger representation than what we currently receive from our incumbent representative- representation that reflects the true value of our collective hard earned tax dollars,” said Ashman.

Alexandre, Dante Arnwine, Bianca Cunningham, Lawman Lynch, Jammel A Thompson Mealy’s district covers Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Ocean Hill, Brownsville, and East Flatbush in Brooklyn. She was first elected to represent District 41 from 2006 to 2017. In 2021, she won again, reclaiming her old city council seat. So far she’s raised $11,500 in private funds for yet another reelection campaign. Many of her challengers are passionate advocates albeit not well funded.

Cunningham was raised by a tight knit family that has deep roots in Harlem. She has worked as a union and community organizer building coalitions around issues such as worker safety, increasing wages and flexibility for workers, securing equity and resources for public school students, and public safety. “I am seeking to represent the 41st district and have a proven record of having political courage to stand with the many to fight for a New York that is clean, safe, and affordable for all,” said Cunningham. “A New York that prioritizes the dignity of our retirees, essential workers, and public servants. I pledge to fight corruption and special interests conspiring to diminish the great promise of this city and our democracy.” Lawman’s motto in this race is to keep Public Safety, Education, Optimization, Public Health, Love, and Entrepreneurship (P.E.O.P.L.E.) at the center. He’s raised $7,346 in private contributions so far. “Our campaign champions social justice through bold action and collaborative leadership to uplift District 41 – Brooklyn,” said Lawman. A native Brooklynite, Thompson is a dedicated public servant and community leader. He plans to put people and families first and prioritize participatory budgeting. He also wants to address senior citizens’ concerns about food insecurity and rent, enhance constituent services, and improve quality of life issues. Arnwine is the district manager for Community Board 9 in Brooklyn. His platform addresses matters of equity and equality for families of color, such as affordable housing, food insecurity and food deserts, health education, the maternal mortality crisis that many Black women are facing, and the range of health disparities Black men are dealing with. He’s raised $10,519 in private funds . “A new vision is coming to Council District 41. A vision based on presence, communication, and strategy,” said Arnwine. “It would be the greatest honor to represent you in the New York City Council as your next Council Member.” District 46 – Incumbent Mercedes Narcisse, Dimple Willabus, Kenny Altidor Narcisse’s district covers Bergen Beach, Canarsie, Flatlands, Georgetown, Gerritsen Beach, Marine Park, Mill Basin, and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn.

Diakhate, Sarah Blas, Jozette Carter-Williams Hanks’s district covers St. George-New Brighton, Tompkinsville-Stapleton-Clifton-Fox Hills, Rosebank-Shore Acres-Park Hill, West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill, Westerleigh-Castleton Corners, Port Richmond, Mariner’s Harbor-Arlington-Graniteville, Snug Harbor, Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Manor Heights, and Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island (SI). Hank follows in the footsteps of former Councilmember Debi Rose, the first Black person elected to higher office on SI. Hanks continues to be the only Black councilmember on SI. Hanks was the founder and president of the Historic Tappen Park Community Partnership and served on the city’s Panel for Education Policy (PEP) prior to getting elected in 2021. She’s raised $77,440 in private funds. Originally from Senegal, Diakhate said he has a deep passion and unwavering commitment to SI’s North Shore as a former Deputy Chief of the HIV/AIDS Unit at the United Nations, a college professor, experienced public servant, and dedicated local activist. His campaign is driven by the needs and aspirations of the community he has called home for over two decades. He plans to support the 30,000 Degrees Initiative, which aims to graduate more students to higher education; advocate for immigrants through his own experiences; fight hunger, homelessness, and the opioid crisis; and develop a clean, vibrant, and fully accessible shoreline that benefits every Staten Islander. He’s raised $7,840 in private contributions. “Our community deserves leadership that listens, understands, and takes action,” Diakhate said. “I am running to ensure Staten Islanders have the tools and resources to thrive — affordable housing, equitable healthcare, reliable transportation, waterfront development, and quality education. I will fight tirelessly to deliver these for every resident of the North Shore.” Blas, one of Hank’s other challengers, is a native New Yorker, a small business owner, and a lifelong advocate for working families as a mother of six. She said she has a passion for creating real solutions from over two decades of championing education reform, housing reform, workforce development, and more on SI. She is running for city council to give a voice to people who feel left behind. She’s raised $6,867 in private contributions. “I believe that the political is profoundly personal. The highs and lows of accessing the city’s resources for myself and my six children is what drives my commitment to the families of the North Shore,” said Blas. “I believe leadership is about service, and I have spent years advocating for real change and delivering solutions for our community. I will bring every ounce of my expertise and lived experience to City Hall.” Carter-Williams , who is a Brooklyn native with Puerto Rican roots, is passionate about addressing crime on SI and revitalizing the local economy. “Every vacant storefront represents a missed opportunity for jobs and growth,” said Carter-Willaims. “We must prioritize filling these spaces by implementing policies that foster job creation, attract small businesses to the district, and improve transportation access to support these enterprises. Revitalizing our local economy starts with empowering businesses and creating employment opportunities for residents.” In terms of public safety, she called for an increased police presence and equitable funding for precincts, community policing, improved surveillance systems, enhanced security infrastructure, and better street lighting. She is also committed to bolstering education through smaller class sizes, reintroducing home economics in high schools, increasing after school options, providing adequate funding for special needs programs, and expanding STEM programs.

Diakhate, Sarah Blas, Jozette Carter-Williams Hanks’s district covers St. George-New Brighton, Tompkinsville-Stapleton-Clifton-Fox Hills, Rosebank-Shore Acres-Park Hill, West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill, Westerleigh-Castleton Corners, Port Richmond, Mariner’s Harbor-Arlington-Graniteville, Snug Harbor, Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Manor Heights, and Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island (SI). Hank follows in the footsteps of former Councilmember Debi Rose, the first Black person elected to higher office on SI. Hanks continues to be the only Black councilmember on SI. Hanks was the founder and president of the Historic Tappen Park Community Partnership and served on the city’s Panel for Education Policy (PEP) prior to getting elected in 2021. She’s raised $77,440 in private funds. Originally from Senegal, Diakhate said he has a deep passion and unwavering commitment to SI’s North Shore as a former Deputy Chief of the HIV/AIDS Unit at the United Nations, a college professor, experienced public servant, and dedicated local activist. His campaign is driven by the needs and aspirations of the community he has called home for over two decades. He plans to support the 30,000 Degrees Initiative, which aims to graduate more students to higher education; advocate for immigrants through his own experiences; fight hunger, homelessness, and the opioid crisis; and develop a clean, vibrant, and fully accessible shoreline that benefits every Staten Islander. He’s raised $7,840 in private contributions. “Our community deserves leadership that listens, understands, and takes action,” Diakhate said. “I am running to ensure Staten Islanders have the tools and resources to thrive — affordable housing, equitable healthcare, reliable transportation, waterfront development, and quality education. I will fight tirelessly to deliver these for every resident of the North Shore.” Blas, one of Hank’s other challengers, is a native New Yorker, a small business owner, and a lifelong advocate for working families as a mother of six. She said she has a passion for creating real solutions from over two decades of championing education reform, housing reform, workforce development, and more on SI. She is running for city council to give a voice to people who feel left behind. She’s raised $6,867 in private contributions. “I believe that the political is profoundly personal. The highs and lows of accessing the city’s resources for myself and my six children is what drives my commitment to the families of the North Shore,” said Blas. “I believe leadership is about service, and I have spent years advocating for real change and delivering solutions for our community. I will bring every ounce of my expertise and lived experience to City Hall.” Carter-Williams , who is a Brooklyn native with Puerto Rican roots, is passionate about addressing crime on SI and revitalizing the local economy. “Every vacant storefront represents a missed opportunity for jobs and growth,” said Carter-Willaims. “We must prioritize filling these spaces by implementing policies that foster job creation, attract small businesses to the district, and improve transportation access to support these enterprises. Revitalizing our local economy starts with empowering businesses and creating employment opportunities for residents.” In terms of public safety, she called for an increased police presence and equitable funding for precincts, community policing, improved surveillance systems, enhanced security infrastructure, and better street lighting. She is also committed to bolstering education through smaller class sizes, reintroducing home economics in high schools, increasing after school options, providing adequate funding for special needs programs, and expanding STEM programs. She’s raised $7,465 in private contributions so far. Support our Racial Justice Journalism Since 1909, bringing you the news that mainstream media just doesn't.
