It begins when we need to do something but we do not know what. First, we embark on a journey into a land of rationality to study the normative approach. Since our ability to think and knowledge are limited and time is pressing, it is not surprising that some behavioral biases will observed in decision making processes. Of course, this will require adjusting our normative theories to capture these biases. This will be the second purpose of this course.

He has experience in flintknapping and other ancient technologies. He is specialized in Paleoanthropology , the evolution of hominin behavior, pleistocene archaeology of the Near East and of Eastern Africa , lithic analysis, as well as experimental archaeology Highlights of Shea's research include the following, in rough chronological order. Identification of stone-tipped spears used by Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens in the East Mediterranean Levant. Excavations at 'Ubeidiya, a 1.4 Million year-old site in the Jordan Valley, Israel. This research was conducted jointly with Ofer Bar-Yosef , Eitan Tchernov, Gerhard Bosinski, Sabine Gaudzinski, and Miriam Belmaker. Excavations at Ar Rasfa, a Middle Paleolithic site in Jordan . This research was conducted jointly with Patricia Crawford and Ghufran Sabri Ahmad (Univ. Mosul). Experimental and morphometric identifications of early complex projectile technology in Africa, the Near East and Europe. This work was done jointly with Zach Davis, Kyle Brown, and Mat Sisk. This project's core finding was that complex projectile technology (bow and arrow, spear thrower, and dart) were major factors in how humans dispersing from Africa displaced Neanderthals and other extinct hominins in temperate Eurasia. Paleoanthropology of the Lower Omo Valley Kibish Formation. This project recovered 200,000 year-old archaeological remains and fossils of the oldest-known Homo sapiens. This research was carried out with John Fleagle , Frank Brown , Solomon Yerga, Zelalem Assefa, Ian Wallace, and others. Proposed replacing Paleolithic archaeological research on \"behavioral modernity\" with a new focus on \"behavioral variability.\" Stone Tools in the Paleolithic and Neolithic of the Near East: A Guide. This is a reference work for the stone tool evidence from the East Mediterranean Levant. Published in 2013, it has recently been issued in paperback. Stone Tools in Human Evolution. This most recent book project uses comparisons of human and non-human primate tool use to predictively model how the stone tool evidence should change as distinctive patterns of hominin behavior evolved. It tests those predictions using evidence from more than 200 archaeological sites dating from >3 million to 6000 years ago. This work was published with Cambridge University Press in 2016 ( Stone Tools in Human Evolution: Behavioral Differences among Technological Primates ). In 2014 he earned the State University of New York Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities . [ 3 ] [ ] Publications [ edit ] [ edit ] Justin H. Pargeter, John J.
