Now, he is running to represent our community on the New York City Council. Erik believes that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more. When Hartley House, the 115 year-old settlement house in Hell’s Kitchen, was threatened with closure, Erik worked with community leaders to come up with a plan to prevent its sale to private developers. When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments . Additionally, he holds weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. Erik’s effective leadership style is reflected in these and countless other examples, as well as in the deep support his candidacy has received from hundreds of community leaders across Council District 3, organized labor, elected officials, tenant groups, healthcare groups, and more . As a longtime member of the Village Independent Democrats and a co-founder of United Thru Action, a resistance group created in the days following the 2016 presidential election, Erik has been a fierce fighter for progressive values in electoral politics. He helped organize dozens of buses of volunteers that traveled to swing districts in Pennsylvania and beyond during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, and was active in the fight to defeat the I.D.C. , which gave Democrats true control over the New York State Senate. This year, on top of his own campaign for City Council, Erik organized weekly phone banks for 17 weeks to help ensure the defeat of the most dangerous president in American history. Over 1,000 volunteers participated, making thousands of phone calls to voters in swing states. Times of crisis call for proven leadership, and the COVID-19 crisis has put New York City’s survival on the line. As our Council Member, Erik will create affordable housing and work to end homelessness fight for safe, livable and vibrant neighborhoods help our small businesses reopen safely and succeed work to root out the systemic racism that pervades society, including our criminal justice system advocate for our children and world-class public schools push for safer streets and better transportation options Erik is a graduate of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and was a Bohnett Leaders Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Senior Executives in State and Local Government program.

Erik believes that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more. When Hartley House, the 115 year-old settlement house in Hell’s Kitchen, was threatened with closure, Erik worked with community leaders to come up with a plan to prevent its sale to private developers. When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments . Additionally, he holds weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. Erik’s effective leadership style is reflected in these and countless other examples, as well as in the deep support his candidacy has received from hundreds of community leaders across Council District 3, organized labor, elected officials, tenant groups, healthcare groups, and more . As a longtime member of the Village Independent Democrats and a co-founder of United Thru Action, a resistance group created in the days following the 2016 presidential election, Erik has been a fierce fighter for progressive values in electoral politics. He helped organize dozens of buses of volunteers that traveled to swing districts in Pennsylvania and beyond during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, and was active in the fight to defeat the I.D.C. , which gave Democrats true control over the New York State Senate. This year, on top of his own campaign for City Council, Erik organized weekly phone banks for 17 weeks to help ensure the defeat of the most dangerous president in American history.

His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more.

When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district.

In 2021, he was elected to represent New York City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of the West Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Times Square, Hudson Square, Flatiron, and the Garment District. He sees his mission as simple yet vital: making New York City a better place to live. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaison in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage. From 2015 to 2021, Erik served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Council Member Corey Johnson. In this role he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of every block of Council District 3 while providing constituent services to tens of thousands of residents and working alongside tenant associations, block associations, community boards, PTAs, parks groups and others to make our community a better place to live. Erik has established a citywide reputation as one of the most active and effective members of the New York City Council, leading on critical issues such as the crises of mental health, housing, sanitation, sustainability, and more. He is working to reverse decades of failed policies and disinvestment in mental healthcare, authoring and passing landmark legislation that requires family homeless shelters to provide on-site mental health services, requiring the Department of Education to provide suicide prevention resources to students, fighting for adequate inpatient psychiatric treatment capacity, and more. Recognizing the importance of clean and healthy neighborhoods, Erik has been at the forefront of sanitation improvement efforts in the city, leading the way on reforms such as the containerization of garbage, reduced usage of single-use plastics, increased corner basket service, and other initiatives to enhance the city’s cleanliness. Few elected officials have been more vocal than Erik about the affordable housing crisis that poses an existential threat to New York City. With the lowest rental apartment vacancy rate since 1968 and the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression, Erik believes that an abundance of housing is needed to bring down housing costs. He has worked with his local community boards to create a pipeline of thousands of affordable housing units in Council District 3. Environmental sustainability is also a key priority for Erik. He has funded the planting of hundreds of new street trees in Council District 3. His legislation creating the Urban Forest Master Plan aims to increase the tree canopy coverage to 30% by 2030. He has championed universal curbside composting, renovated parks and playgrounds, waged war against single-use plastics, and promoted cycling as a form of transportation by creating new protected bike lanes on Tenth Avenue and Lower Sixth Avenue. Erik is Co-Chair of the Council’s Manhattan Delegation and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. He serves on the following City Council committees: Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addition; Public Housing; Small Business; Technology; Economic Development; Civil Service and Labor; Contracts; Higher Education; and Immigration.

    "text": "personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaison in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage. From 2015 to 2021, Erik served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Council Member Corey Johnson. In this role he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of every block of Council District 3 while providing constituent services to tens of thousands of residents and working alongside tenant associations, block associations, community boards, PTAs, parks groups and others to make our community a better place to live. Erik has established a citywide reputation as one of the most active and effective members of the New York City Council, leading on critical issues such as the crises of mental health, housing, sanitation, sustainability, and more. He is working to reverse decades of failed policies and disinvestment in mental healthcare, authoring and passing landmark legislation that requires family homeless shelters to provide on-site mental health services, requiring the Department of Education to provide suicide prevention resources to students, fighting for adequate inpatient psychiatric treatment capacity, and more. Recognizing the importance of clean and healthy neighborhoods, Erik has been at the forefront of sanitation improvement efforts in the city, leading the way on reforms such as the containerization of garbage, reduced usage of single-use plastics, increased corner basket service, and other initiatives to enhance the city’s cleanliness. Few elected officials have been more vocal than Erik about the affordable housing crisis that poses an existential threat to New York City. With the lowest rental apartment vacancy rate since 1968 and the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression, Erik believes that an abundance of housing is needed to bring down housing costs. He has worked with his local community boards to create a pipeline of thousands of affordable housing units in Council District 3. Environmental sustainability is also a key priority for Erik. He has funded the planting of hundreds of new street trees in Council District 3. His legislation creating the Urban Forest Master Plan aims to increase the tree canopy coverage to 30% by 2030. He has championed universal curbside composting, renovated parks and playgrounds, waged war against single-use plastics, and promoted cycling as a form of transportation by creating new protected bike lanes on Tenth Avenue and Lower Sixth Avenue. Erik is Co-Chair of the Council’s Manhattan Delegation and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus.
