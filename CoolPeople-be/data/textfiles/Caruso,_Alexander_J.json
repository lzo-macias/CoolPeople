Raised by an Italian father and Colombian mother, both in the legal profession, understanding the law, justice, and doing the right thing runs in my blood. As a teacher, I know first-hand how broken our public education system is in NYC. I couldn't stand by working in a system that fails our children. I’m running for the same reason I became a teacher —for the kids. If we’re not building a better society for them, then what’s the point? That means addressing our housing crisis, building better schools, and having a city government ran by tried and true public servants. This is why I’m running for NYC Council District 19.
