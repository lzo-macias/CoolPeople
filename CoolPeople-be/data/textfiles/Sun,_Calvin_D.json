Select Page Calvin D. Sun, MD Emergency Physician, Author, Speaker, & Traveler The Monsoon Diaries: A Memoir Our experiences from a decade of “monsooning” around the world—curtailed by the global shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic — have now been captured in a book, The Monsoon Diaries: A Memoir , published by HarperCollins with a foreword by the renowned Lisa Ling. Drawing from the lessons learned while traveling to over 190 countries, and from the profound grief Dr. Sun faced as a teenager after his father’s passing, this memoir chronicles his journey as a young Asian American growing up in New York, finding his calling first in medical school, and then on the open road. Through these experiences, we’ve discovered that the fight for a better world brings meaning to life, even in the most uncertain times. We hope this story helps readers transform their own tragedies into possibilities, fostering a more empathetic and connected society. Read it today! Dr. Calvin D. Sun is a board-certified Physician specializing in Emergency Medicine, a public speaker, author, activist, and travel writer based in NYC.
