They are doing so well since I’ve put them into the ground. Thank you so much Style Roses. Sunita 16/03/2025 Beautiful rose Thank you so much for the beautiful rose named Just James, bought in memory of my beloved husband who passed away suddenly in December, it will be looked after with love, Margaret Close 14/03/2025 Blue Rose Plant My plant came really quickly. Healthy looking. I will be definitely buying from this company again. I am so pleased. 25/02/25 Megan Rose Plant Potted I am absolutely astounded at the super fast over night delivery amazing and the plant is huge and very well established I’m extremely impressed with it and it is a extremely important gift for my best friend who’s 26 year old daughter has passed away and the rose plant i have bought for her is called Megan which is the name of her daughter. We are both florists and very aware of the extremely high standard expected from us and the flowers and plants we sell at the florist and so I can honestly say that I am beyond impressed with the plant . Great value for money as it will live forever and I could instantly see that the plant is going to flourish and has been loved by the grower you can tell by how the stems are cut and how green the whole plant is not even a tiny bit of black or brown dots anywhere with perfect red edges on the new leaves , I just think it’s hard to get exactly what you want unless you go to a garden centre but if you don’t drive its not always possible to get to one and then there’s no guarantee that they will have what you want so this is perfect in that respect, my advice is this is a fantastic place to buy very high quality plants for very little money and effort Amazing thank you style roses 20/02/2025 In Memory Of Mark My best friends husband passed away 2 weeks ago from a rare brain cancer. His name was mark and he was a bus driver who loved giraffes ❤️ I wanted something that could be planted in his memory by grandchildren as a lasting memory of him. I was so thrilled to find a rose called mark – he loved his rose garden, and being red like his bus it just seemed meant to be! I was a little worried about the rose travelling – it had to come to Devon and then onto London.. a long journey! It arrived in a beautiful tall box which was clearly marked and instructed upon for the delivery drivers. The rose was potted, well watered and covered in a layer of plastic so even if the worst happened and it was knocked over, it would’ve travelled well! The rose itself looked in top condition – it had already started to sprout leaves, looked a beautiful colour and was a good size. I am really impressed! Will definitely be back to order again – thank you for taking such care in sending your roses 12/02/2025 Wow! What a wonderful company! Order on Thursday evening on the Internet, confirmed immediately, delivery details on Friday morning, delivered Saturday before 10am."

I was a little worried about the rose travelling – it had to come to Devon and then onto London.. a long journey! It arrived in a beautiful tall box which was clearly marked and instructed upon for the delivery drivers. The rose was potted, well watered and covered in a layer of plastic so even if the worst happened and it was knocked over, it would’ve travelled well! The rose itself looked in top condition – it had already started to sprout leaves, looked a beautiful colour and was a good size. I am really impressed! Will definitely be back to order again – thank you for taking such care in sending your roses 12/02/2025 Wow! What a wonderful company! Order on Thursday evening on the Internet, confirmed immediately, delivery details on Friday morning, delivered Saturday before 10am."

I will definitely recommend and I am about to order another for a gift. Thank you Wonderful Superb Roses I came accross this company’s roses earlier this year when surfing the internet with ebay. I was impressed with the quality of the selection, so I ordered a couple of potted roses. Delivery was swift, and they came in specially designed cardboard boxes, which truly protected the roses. And I couldn’t get over how healthy the roses looked when they arrived. As a bonus, the company also included a really helpful leaflet that was full of useful tips on how to look after the roses. I’ve been so happy with my original order that I’ve ordered another of their beautiful roses. This time I surfed the actual Style Rose website, which is even better than the ebay site. Again, the selection is superb. Truly, everything about this wonderful company speaks of quality. I would recommend them to anyone. You will not be disappointed. Superb Roses Tequila Sunrise My Rose Bush arrived in perfect order and I was thrilled with it, thank you for taking such care with your packaging.

Challenged and living in the area many living here for over 40 years. This campaign was launched after founding an online program entitled Aging Gracefully back in 2016. She founded it with a mission to make a positive impact on the lives of aging women in the United States. She realized that what older residents experience in Queens District 21 is experienced state and nationwide. The difference she has committed to make is the desire to do something about it while enabling future generations to have a different experience once they too age. Dr. Rose's journey did not begin here. It started 30 years ago with a deep-rooted passion for serving the community and a commitment to addressing the unique needs of community across the age spectrum. As she is known to say: I envision communities are thriving from the cradle to the grave. Especially, as we age. With extensive experience in Corporate, and Community Development and as a psychotherapist by higher education, Dr. Rose has a genuine desire to promote economic and social wellness holistically. She also recognizes that people, families, cannot do it alone without an infrastructure to support them along the road. That means where we live, work, and play doing so as a Community of One. Dr. Rose excels in bring community together, building collaborative networks, and getting policy crafted meaningfully often with great results. Her dedication to advocacy ensures that the voices of both young and old heard and their concerns are addressed effectively. Trust Dr. Diane Rose to champion the well-being of all residents in Queens District 21. DREAM BIG AGAIN: # Aging Gracefully Well in Queens District 21 Introduction to Diane Rose : Why Am I Runing for Political Office ? When I look in the mirror, I see you, which motivates my candidacy. Whether you’re the mother trying to get your kids to a good school, or a woman working hard in hopes of getting promoted, or a young person about to graduate from college and wondering what’s next, or an older person like me prayerful that your income will meet your needs, and you can stay healthy. We all, regardless of age, want to do so well whatever well means to you. Though we may come from different places and speak different languages, we are and want the same things. The Quality of Life! Hi! Glad to be part of the community! I am a retired Psychotherapist by profession, College Professor/Researcher and National/State/Local Consultant on a variety of projects on Housing, Jobs, Entrepreneurship, and Human Services. I am coming out of retirement because of the invisibility and voicelessness that is projected upon older persons in my City and beyond. Though we are 55% of the voting bloc in my city, we only receive less than 1% of the City Budget allocated to meet the needs of older persons and these needs are not for those like me: A former Grandparent who raised my grandchild through High School, a Caregiver who took care of Mom, Sister, and Brother before their passing, and someone ineligible for benefits to support those in poverty where over 50% of my income goes toward housing. So, I decided to be the solution by bringing my past knowledge and experience in dealing on both sides of the aisle all who have forgotten that aging well is most important regardless of how old we are! I am here because I am the ShapeShifter, the SeaWomanship, and the BootStrapper like those who mentored me in the past! All are “no longer here to confide!” I hope this describes me well. My goal is to win! However, my weakness is technological savvy, I admit it. My work did not require it and when it did, I had assistance. Yet, when you’re retired, these resources begin to disappear. So, here I am! I hope to find the support here. As well as Comradery amongst other candidates. Please stop by and say hello! VOTE Dr. Diane Rose June 24th Create Your Own Website With Webador"
