Brown previously served as executive vice president of 21Wilberforce as well as associate professor of religion at East Texas Baptist University, where he was founding director of the Freedom Center. He earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor and a Ph.D. in divinity from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Rev.

He has submitted reports to the United Nations, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, and numerous foundations and groups. He is married to Amy, and they have three children: Hudson, Sahara and Keziah. The Currie-Strickland lecture series is made possible through the generosity of Dr. and Mrs. Gary Elliston and was established to honor the life of Dr. David R. Currie, retired executive director of Texas Baptists Committed; and the memory of Phil Strickland, who dedicated nearly 40 years of ministry to the Baptist General Convention of Texas’ Christian Life Commission. Admission to the lectures is free, but reservations are requested. To R.S.V.P, contact HPU’s School of Christian Studies by e-mail at [email protected] or by phone at 325-649-8403. Rev. Elijah M.

Unfortunately, he did not crack the depth chart and headed to FAU after his freshman season. Across the past 2 seasons with the Owls, Brown appeared in 11 games for the program. However, he has just 1 career catch for 22 yards to his credit. In spite of the limited usage, he is still an intriguing TE prospect for Mark Stoops and the Wildcats.
