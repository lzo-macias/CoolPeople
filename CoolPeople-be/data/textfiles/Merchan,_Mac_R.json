I immediately put it in my case and tried to pair it with my iPhone. It would not work. I emailed The Mac Merchant the next day asking how I go about getting a return started so I could either send it back to receive a replacement or a refund. I left all my contact info, including my order number. I was never contacted. Again on April 26, 2021 I emailed The Mac Merchant asking for the same help. My email went unanswered. Then on May 3rd I started a “chat” on their website stating again what I needed. I knew I only had 14 days to receive a refund and that was just a few days away. The “chat” told me someone would be with me in typically less than an hour, given the time of morning I had started my chat. No one ever responded to me. I continued to post on the “chat” that I would like some kind of communication because I was only a few days away from the 14 day mark and my “chats” went unanswered the entire day. I searched their site and the internet for a direct telephone number and was unable to locate one. I could only find the email address or the “chat” box. I made another attempt to connect with someone on their “chat” on May 4th, 2021, same thing, no response. Each time I gave my order number, telephone number and email address to be contacted"
