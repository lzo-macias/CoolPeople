    "text": "Brooklyn. Advocate for mandatory field trips to increase exposure to cultural institutions and the Arts for students of color. Work with principals to create Night Schools for youth & adult educational programming. Create funding opportunities for school Parent Associations to engage more families in our education system. Transportation As a member of the NYC Transit Riders Council , I have and continue to advocate for the accessibility of Franklin Avenue-Medgar Evers College (2,3,4,5,S) in the next MTA capital plan. Strong cities have strong transportation networks that are accessible to all. We should consider public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects to bring equity and increased accessibility to the network. We need a transportation infrastructure in place to support the future affordable residential and commercial opportunities we want to come online. Dante will… Highlight over and over there are ZERO ADA-accessible train stations in the 41st Council District Be an avid supporter of the expansion of the (2)(5) trains on Nostrand and (4) trains along Utica Avenue. Support common sense traffic and pedestrian policies and projects around schools, parks, and cultural institutions. Create legislation requiring car share companies to maintain spots for Alternate Side Parking rules. Fund speed reducer (speed bump) request approved for installation in D41by New York City Department of Transportation Work with the Dept. of Transportation to repurpose spots created by the “Daylighting” initiative. Modernize and reform Access-a-Ride to make the experience easier for older adults and individuals with disabilities Advocate for electric buses as the MTA considers redesigns to the Brooklyn Bus Network. Workforce Development & Small Businesses Good UNION jobs means we can negotiate higher wages and greater benefits for workers on projects in the district. I will require all ULURP application in CD41 to use union labor on projects . We will use good union jobs to bring people and families out of poverty and to create stability and securing for working families. And, commercial rent is crippling small businesses across the district. I will negotiate commercial rent stabilized leases to ensure opportunities for small businesses to thrive. Dante will… Support the expansion of merchant associations & BID operations in CD41. Modernize the city public procurement processes to ensure nonprofits get paid on time. Support Commercial Rent Stabilization Advocate for funding to ensure working receive required hours of safety training under LL196 Ensure that (re)development plans in Black neighborhoods include commitments to training and long-term employment in high-quality jobs for incumbent residents. Require developers to fill in gaps in services by reinvesting in community (Bus shelters, trash receptacles, computers for students, graffiti removal, etc. Sit down with leaders in the hospitality industry to create new opportunities for LGBTQIA+ persons and people of color in the 41st Council District who aspire to make in the culinary and beverage industries. NYCHA & Mitchell-Lama Many older adults live in NYCHA and Mitchell-Lama units across the city. Abhorrent conditions throughout NYCHA developments require swift action to address. The typical bandaids to address repairs or long overdue upgrades are unjust, leaving families sometimes living in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Additional oversight of these programs will ensure families receive the services and support required by law. Making it easier for individuals living in these buildings to renew or apply for appropriate services online will streamline processes and speed up renewal. Right now, NYCHA is under attack via the PACT-RAD program. We must stop the privatization of NYCHA and infuse the agency with funds to address the billions in needed repairs.

To address our housing crisis, we must create affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for families of all sizes while strengthening rent regulations that protect tenants. Our district needs housing that will address the long-term wants and needs of the community. Dante will… Continued enforcement of LL18 to protect our neighborhoods. We have to figure out how to prevent private equity from infiltrating our communities while giving homeowners less-bureaucratic rental opportunities. Hold KNOW YOUR RIGHTS forums and community events with tenant rights advocates and organizations. Advocate for initiatives focused on creating homeownership opportunities for all families. Demand all housing developed on city-owned lots be targeted to seniors, low and extremely low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and formerly incarcerated. Advocate to our Members of Congress to change the AMI (Area Median Income) formula used to determine affordability. Fight to bring warehoused apartments online to increase housing stock. Require certain rezonings to require the creation of community space or open space Require developers to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Infrastructure for support. All new developments with 75 units or more are required to build sufficient parking relative to the number of units created and the population demand. Work with block and neighborhood associations to inform homeowners and renters of their rights and connect them to current housing benefits. Write a policy requiring landlords/ managing agents to clean trash chutes no less than three (3) times a year and post an inspection report in the lobby of their building for tenant review. Environment, Culture, and Recreation Brooklyn is culture and art. We must promote and advocate for quality arts programming to support and strengthen the district’s cultural life. The more programs offered to our youth, the more exposure they gain to understanding other cultures, leading to conversations about unity, not division. Dante will… Support the 1% Parks Budget movement. Support enforcement of LL97 to reduce emissions from buildings Expand community garden usage and secure investments in infrastructure Support cultural events and programming by connecting organizations to public funding Additional mobile units must be procured to connect people to IDNYC, New York City’s municipal identification program.
