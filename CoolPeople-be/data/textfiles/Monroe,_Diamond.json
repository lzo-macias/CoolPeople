Mental health issues are caused by a variety of reasons , but a way to solve this problem is by including self care in your daily routine .Our mission is to create products that make people feel good in their skin and feel good about their hair. Hair Growth View all Hair Growth View all Turmeric and Honey Brightening Body Collection View all Turmeric and Honey Brightening Body Collection View all Our Story Diamond Monrooe Organics was birthed on the street of Wise Owl in Greensboro, NC. Diamond Monroe was once a curious girl that desired to explore the many potentials stored in her hair and skin. After experiemneting a variety of resources, she knew she could not do it everything on her own . So, her faith was placed in Christ leaning upon the understanding of his knowledge alone. With God she knew her visions would then become her reality making anything POSSIBLE with him\" \"For with GOD nothing shall be impossible\"- Luke 1:37 Shop Diamond Monroe Organics Meet The CEO In late 2016, I experienced heat damage in my hair along with a skin infection known as Tinea Versicolor. I tried almost every hair growth product on the market, and they were not successful for my hair. I didn’t know what to do until one day I decided to do a bit of research on my own. After lots of research I began to mix creations for myself. I grew my hair back out with our hair growth serum which is our company’s best seller. Contrastingly my skin was a much more difficult task. All my life, I always had sensitive skin, but it wasn’t until I reached the age of 17, I started to develop a bit more issues. My skin began to change colors in places that were visible which presented an issue, especially as a teenager .! The skin conditions manifested in very dry patches and were flaky. What made the issue even worse was that my sweat is what caused my skin condition to increase in severity. In this situation it felt impossible because I am a student athlete! Being a student athlete, my everyday life includes lots of sweating as I play in games and train. Even after I was recommended a specific product from the doctor, I still faced the same difficulty. So that moment I realized that, if I could make a hair product that became a solution for my hair then I can create something for the skin as well! Shark Tank Pitch The CEO Diamond Monroe was given the opportunity to pitch Diamond Monroe Organics to Shark Tank's very own Daymon John . After her three minute pitch John was quick to respond to Monroe, saying that her pitch was “one of the best pitches I’ve heard in three minutes,” saying that she had identified a problem, posed a solution and backed it up with data. “All that stuff you talked about, you backed it up,” John said. Psalms 27:1 \" The Lord Is My Light and My Salvation . Whom Shall I Fear\" In Sweet Loving memory of Annie Marie Mckoy Bethea. COMING SOON....

High-Touch Customer Service Custom Jewelry Pieces Locally Owned and Operated Decades of Experience Check Out Our Extraordinary Jewelry & Timepieces Wyatt's Diamond Jewelers 4.6 G o o g l e G o o g l e They are very knowledgeable and great people to work with! Their jewlery is beautiful and they stand behind their sales. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Lots of attractive items and friendly staff. I had been sitting on an omega watch that I was told wasn't worth fixing. Dropped it off at Wyatt's, and I am now a proud owner of fine working omega watch. Amazing!!!! I had the best experience. They treated me like family and sold me an amazing necklace. Loved hearing all the stories and history of the store. My fiance and I found the perfect engagement ring and Jim and Dean were simply lovely to deal with. Friendly, jovial, never pushy or \"Salesperson-ish\". We shopped around for due diligence reasons and came to the conclusion the ring we found at their store was \"the one\".It's not easy to part with a lot of money for a ring but when it's your soulmate, it's not an issue, but even more so when such kind and wonderful people are behind the buying process. I highly recommend them! I had been an intermittent customer of Wyatt's for years until I moved out of state. I purchased unique pieces as presents for my wife, which she has proudly worn ever since. People often notice her jewelry and make highly appreciative comments, which pleases both of us. Wyatt's has also cleaned and maintained a special watch I got as a gift (from elsewhere) very satisfactorily for years. Recently, they had it for service at the time I moved, and they were able to complete the appropriate service and ship it (insured) to my new address. I highly recommend this company, both for their experienced and candid opinions and advice as well as their artistic workmanship! I cannot imagine you would ever be disappointed. Brought in a ring that was over 100 years old to get repaired and cleaned. They did an amazing job! The service was great and I will definitely be returning in the future!
