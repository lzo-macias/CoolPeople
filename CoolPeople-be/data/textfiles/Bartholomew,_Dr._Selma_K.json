Having survived the crack epidemic, at 16 she went off to college, earned a degree in Math and Physics from Lehman College. With a baby in her arms, she worked on two master’s degrees at the same time, one from Adelphi and a master’s from Fordham and went onto earning her Doctorate.

She has put her focus on ending the achievement gap and developing the capacity of teachers and building ecosystems in STEAM across the country. Dr ★ Selma Bartholomew knows how to build partnerships that result in clear thinking, full participation, only to arrive at results that change people’s lives.
