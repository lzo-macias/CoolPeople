Shanequa , thanks for joining us, excited to have you contributing your stories and insights. Risk taking is something we’re really interested in and we’d love to hear the story of a risk you’ve taken. The most significant risk I took in starting my business was temporarily pausing my nursing career to fully explore entrepreneurship. It was a leap into the unknown, as I needed to determine if this path was truly what I wanted for the long haul. During the initial stages of my business, I still had to maintain a regular job to support my family as a single mom of three. I worked at Starbucks and also took on a full-time overnight position at a nursing rehab facility. Balancing these demanding roles while nurturing my business was no small feat. As the demand for my business grew, I realized I needed to dedicate more time to it. However, I wasn’t ready to leave my job entirely, so I transitioned from full-time work to a PRN/flexible schedule that allowed me to manage my time better. This decision came with the sacrifice of my benefits, but I was willing to take that risk to pursue my business goals. Building my business also meant spending less time with my kids and family. Thankfully, I had a strong support system in place, which helped me navigate this challenging yet rewarding journey. Every sacrifice I made was ultimately aimed at creating a better future for my family. Awesome – so before we get into the rest of our questions, can you briefly introduce yourself to our readers. As the owner of Smooth Tax Solutions LLC and Co-Founder of Mind Your Assets Tax School, I am excited to share some insights about my business and our upcoming launches. My firm is based in the heart of Birmingham, Alabama, I have been a part of the tax industry for a decade, transitioning to full-time entrepreneurship seven years ago. Alongside managing my businesses, I am also a proud mother of three.Smooth Tax Solutions LLC specializes in individual and small business taxes, offering a range of financial services tailored to meet the diverse needs of business owners. Our commitment is to provide clients with expert advice, professionalism, responsiveness, and most importantly, peace of mind when they trust us with their financial matters. Any insights you can share with us about how you built up your social media presence? Building my social media audience has been a journey rooted in consistency and understanding my followers. I make it a point to post regularly, which helps keep my audience engaged and aware of my brand. I focus on content that resonates with my audience, balancing humorous and relatable posts with straightforward business updates. This variety keeps things fresh and caters to different interests within my follower base. One key lesson I’ve learned is that followers can lose interest quickly. To combat this, I keep my captions concise and informative. Nowadays, people don’t want to read long paragraphs; they prefer quick bites of information that get straight to the point. Additionally, I believe in sharing glimpses of my personal life like celebrating my kids’ birthdays or sharing family vacations. This not only humanizes my brand but also helps my audience connect with me on a personal level, showing them that I’m just like them and not solely focused on business. Advice for Upcoming Entrepreneurs on Rising on Social Media: 1. **Stay Consistent:** Regular posting is vital.

Use analytics to refine your strategy and cater to your audience’s preferences. Can you talk to us about how your side-hustle turned into something more. Becoming a business owner and a tax professional was never part of my original dreams or plans. My journey began when I was searching for a part-time job to support my family. I stumbled upon an opportunity for a tax professional position, and though I had no prior experience, the prospect of quick earnings and the chance to engage in something I thought I’d enjoy caught my attention. I decided to give it a try, and while the money did come in quickly, I quickly realized it came with significant responsibilities. However, I embraced the challenge. I found joy in the work and developed my skills over the three years I spent with the same company. Eventually, my passion for the field and desire for independence led me to establish my own firm, Smooth Tax Solutions. It’s been an incredible journey, transforming what started as a simple part-time job into a fulfilling career and business that allows me to help others navigate their financial landscapes.
