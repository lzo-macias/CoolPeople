After attending PS 185, McKinley JHS and Xaverian High School, Brannan studied journalism in college before embarking on a career as a professional musician. His bands released several albums and toured the world – performing in over fifty countries across five continents. Later, while working at a New York City radio station, Brannan got involved in union organizing and fought to recover unpaid wages for his co-workers. He then served as chief of staff to his predecessor Councilman Vinnie Gentile before being tapped by Mayor de Blasio to help oversee the expansion of his historic universal pre-K initiative as director of intergovernmental affairs at the NYC Department of Education. A believer in the importance of making government work efficiently and making life easier for working and middle class families, Brannan was first elected in 2017 from a crowded field of ten candidates to represent southwest Brooklyn. With too many people feeling that the government only works for the wealthy and well-connected, Brannan vowed to always fight for the “little guy.” Today, when he isn’t personally making sure your garbage gets picked up or rescuing a wayward kitten in a tree, Brannan serves as Chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance where he oversees the largest municipal budget in the country. Whether pushing to expand the New York City Human Rights Law to empower survivors of domestic violence or delivering the first New York City property tax rebate in 15 years, Brannan has never backed down from a fight. As the lucky recipient of a cornea transplant, Brannan has pushed for free vision care & eyeglasses for the poor. Often acknowledging that the three chords he learned at McKinley afforded him a career as a world-touring musician, Brannan has been a champion for increased arts & music funding in our public schools.

If New Yorkers don’t feel safe, then nothing else we do matters. Justin knows that public safety is the foundation of a thriving city and our cops are a vital piece of that puzzle, but they cannot be the only piece. We need to let our cops do the jobs they signed up to do while investing in the programs and priorities that prevent crime in the first place. By expanding access to education, jobs, healthcare, food, housing, and mental health services, Justin will ensure the city’s investments in public safety are smart, holistic, effective, and grounded in community trust, making every neighborhood a safer place to live, work, and raise a family. Tackling the Absurd Cost of Living To Make Our City More Affordable Income inequality is the reason working people are still struggling to make ends meet - it’s one of the greatest challenges facing our city and our nation. The best tool we have to fight the effects of income inequality is the city budget, which can help improve the cost of living and deliver vital programs that can make life easier for working people. Justin has always been on the front lines of this fight, making sure programs like after-school and early childhood education are fully funded. As Comptroller, Justin will hold city agencies accountable for delivering equitable outcomes, push for fair wages, and invest in programs that raise up underrepresented communities. He will ensure the city’s budget works to narrow the wealth gap and make New York livable for all families – not just the wealthy few.

He knows the city’s procurement process is busted and broken, plagued by inefficiency, delays, and a lack of transparency. Too often, critical projects are held up, and New Yorkers in need are left hanging as non-profit providers are asked to do even more with even less. These vital organizations who so often serve our city’s most vulnerable shouldn’t have to take out high-interest loans to pay their staff while they wait to get paid back by the city. As Comptroller, Justin will prioritize overhauling the procurement system to make it faster, more transparent, and accountable. Diversifying Investments, Strengthening Black & Brown Communities Justin Brannan is committed to ensuring New York City’s investments drive equity, opportunity, and meaningful change. As Comptroller, Justin will champion initiatives to strengthen Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), recognizing their critical role in providing banking services, loans, and access to capital in historically neglected communities. These institutions are vital to job creation, fostering small business growth, and building generational wealth in under-resourced neighborhoods. Justin also believes the city's pension funds should reflect the diversity of the city they serve. He is dedicated to bringing more women and people of color into the ranks of pension fund managers, ensuring that investment strategies benefit from a wide range of perspectives and expertise. By supporting MDIs and prioritizing inclusive investment practices, Justin will help grow opportunity, close wealth gaps, and lift up communities that have been overlooked for far too long. Combating Climate Change Justin knows that fighting climate change is not just a moral imperative—it’s an economic opportunity. In southern Brooklyn, he has led efforts to invest in sustainable infrastructure, clean energy, and resilient green spaces, protecting communities from rising sea levels and extreme weather. As Comptroller, Justin will ensure that the city’s investments prioritize climate resilience, renewable energy, and green jobs. He will work to divest from fossil fuels and reinvest in projects that create a sustainable future for all New Yorkers. From reducing emissions to making the city more resilient to climate threats, Justin will ensure our budget reflects the urgency of the climate crisis. Cracking Down on Corruption Justin Brannan has zero tolerance for politicians who abuse their power. That’s why he wrote the law that bars anyone convicted of public corruption from ever running for office again – because if you betray the public’s trust, you don't get a second chance at being an elected official. He believes public service is a public trust and that our government should work for the people, not the well-connected. Justin will keep fighting for tougher ethics laws, real accountability, and transparency at every level – especially when it comes to your hard-earned tax dollars. Ensuring Safety in Our Subways Our subway system is the lifeblood of New York City, and every rider deserves to feel safe. Justin believes that addressing subway safety requires a reimagined, holistic approach because New York City's current approach is simply not working – especially when it comes to combating homelessness and mental illness on our subways. In the merciless winter cold and summer heat, people experiencing homelessness routinely seek shelter by riding the subways to the end of the line stations where there is a longer layover. Outreach workers attempt to coax people into accepting shelter and other services but the overtures are typically rejected over and over again. The fact that someone would rather spend the day riding the subway back and forth instead of accepting shelter and medical care is an indictment on the entire system. As Comptroller, Justin will push for better mental health services, smarter outreach in the transit system to help those in crisis, changes to the involuntary removal and commitment rules, and more safe haven beds. He will also advocate for increased staffing of station agents and unarmed transit personnel, and ensure a visible police presence that focuses on deterrence and support rather than escalation. Finally, we need to be moving people suffering from serious mental illness off the subways and directly into permanent supportive housing. By combining smart investments with accountability, Justin will work to restore safety and trust in our subway system. Investing Our Pension Funds in New York Values Justin believes the city’s pension funds must deliver steady, strong, and stable financial returns while reflecting the values of New Yorkers.

He is dedicated to bringing more women and people of color into the ranks of pension fund managers, ensuring that investment strategies benefit from a wide range of perspectives and expertise. By supporting MDIs and prioritizing inclusive investment practices, Justin will help grow opportunity, close wealth gaps, and lift up communities that have been overlooked for far too long. Combating Climate Change Justin knows that fighting climate change is not just a moral imperative—it’s an economic opportunity. In southern Brooklyn, he has led efforts to invest in sustainable infrastructure, clean energy, and resilient green spaces, protecting communities from rising sea levels and extreme weather. As Comptroller, Justin will ensure that the city’s investments prioritize climate resilience, renewable energy, and green jobs. He will work to divest from fossil fuels and reinvest in projects that create a sustainable future for all New Yorkers. From reducing emissions to making the city more resilient to climate threats, Justin will ensure our budget reflects the urgency of the climate crisis. Cracking Down on Corruption Justin Brannan has zero tolerance for politicians who abuse their power. That’s why he wrote the law that bars anyone convicted of public corruption from ever running for office again – because if you betray the public’s trust, you don't get a second chance at being an elected official. He believes public service is a public trust and that our government should work for the people, not the well-connected. Justin will keep fighting for tougher ethics laws, real accountability, and transparency at every level – especially when it comes to your hard-earned tax dollars. Ensuring Safety in Our Subways Our subway system is the lifeblood of New York City, and every rider deserves to feel safe. Justin believes that addressing subway safety requires a reimagined, holistic approach because New York City's current approach is simply not working – especially when it comes to combating homelessness and mental illness on our subways. In the merciless winter cold and summer heat, people experiencing homelessness routinely seek shelter by riding the subways to the end of the line stations where there is a longer layover. Outreach workers attempt to coax people into accepting shelter and other services but the overtures are typically rejected over and over again. The fact that someone would rather spend the day riding the subway back and forth instead of accepting shelter and medical care is an indictment on the entire system. As Comptroller, Justin will push for better mental health services, smarter outreach in the transit system to help those in crisis, changes to the involuntary removal and commitment rules, and more safe haven beds. He will also advocate for increased staffing of station agents and unarmed transit personnel, and ensure a visible police presence that focuses on deterrence and support rather than escalation. Finally, we need to be moving people suffering from serious mental illness off the subways and directly into permanent supportive housing. By combining smart investments with accountability, Justin will work to restore safety and trust in our subway system.

These institutions are vital to job creation, fostering small business growth, and building generational wealth in under-resourced neighborhoods. Justin also believes the city's pension funds should reflect the diversity of the city they serve. He is dedicated to bringing more women and people of color into the ranks of pension fund managers, ensuring that investment strategies benefit from a wide range of perspectives and expertise. By supporting MDIs and prioritizing inclusive investment practices, Justin will help grow opportunity, close wealth gaps, and lift up communities that have been overlooked for far too long. Combating Climate Change Justin knows that fighting climate change is not just a moral imperative—it’s an economic opportunity. In southern Brooklyn, he has led efforts to invest in sustainable infrastructure, clean energy, and resilient green spaces, protecting communities from rising sea levels and extreme weather. As Comptroller, Justin will ensure that the city’s investments prioritize climate resilience, renewable energy, and green jobs. He will work to divest from fossil fuels and reinvest in projects that create a sustainable future for all New Yorkers. From reducing emissions to making the city more resilient to climate threats, Justin will ensure our budget reflects the urgency of the climate crisis. Cracking Down on Corruption Justin Brannan has zero tolerance for politicians who abuse their power. That’s why he wrote the law that bars anyone convicted of public corruption from ever running for office again – because if you betray the public’s trust, you don't get a second chance at being an elected official. He believes public service is a public trust and that our government should work for the people, not the well-connected. Justin will keep fighting for tougher ethics laws, real accountability, and transparency at every level – especially when it comes to your hard-earned tax dollars. Ensuring Safety in Our Subways Our subway system is the lifeblood of New York City, and every rider deserves to feel safe. Justin believes that addressing subway safety requires a reimagined, holistic approach because New York City's current approach is simply not working – especially when it comes to combating homelessness and mental illness on our subways. In the merciless winter cold and summer heat, people experiencing homelessness routinely seek shelter by riding the subways to the end of the line stations where there is a longer layover. Outreach workers attempt to coax people into accepting shelter and other services but the overtures are typically rejected over and over again. The fact that someone would rather spend the day riding the subway back and forth instead of accepting shelter and medical care is an indictment on the entire system. As Comptroller, Justin will push for better mental health services, smarter outreach in the transit system to help those in crisis, changes to the involuntary removal and commitment rules, and more safe haven beds. He will also advocate for increased staffing of station agents and unarmed transit personnel, and ensure a visible police presence that focuses on deterrence and support rather than escalation. Finally, we need to be moving people suffering from serious mental illness off the subways and directly into permanent supportive housing. By combining smart investments with accountability, Justin will work to restore safety and trust in our subway system. Investing Our Pension Funds in New York Values Justin believes the city’s pension funds must deliver steady, strong, and stable financial returns while reflecting the values of New Yorkers.

He knows the city’s procurement process is busted and broken, plagued by inefficiency, delays, and a lack of transparency. Too often, critical projects are held up, and New Yorkers in need are left hanging as non-profit providers are asked to do even more with even less. These vital organizations who so often serve our city’s most vulnerable shouldn’t have to take out high-interest loans to pay their staff while they wait to get paid back by the city.

Expanding Opportunities Through Investments in CUNY Justin has always believed that education is the great equalizer, and he has fought to expand opportunities for students, from preschoolers to PhD candidates. As a Council Member, Justin secured funding for the creation of seven brand new public schools in southern Brooklyn, including the first high school in Bay Ridge in 80 years. Justin knows that CUNY is a critical pathway to success for so many New Yorkers, providing affordable education and job training. As Comptroller, he will work to expand access to CUNY programs, ensuring they remain affordable and responsive to the needs of a changing workforce. By investing in CUNY, Justin will help prepare the next generation of New Yorkers for success. Fighting Food Insecurity Food insecurity remains a pressing issue in New York City, with many families struggling to put meals on the table. As Comptroller, Justin will prioritize city investments in programs that combat hunger, such as funding for food pantries, school meal programs, and urban agriculture initiatives. He will hold agencies accountable for delivering resources to communities in need. Fixing New York City’s Broken Property Tax System New York City’s property tax system is outdated, unfair, and deeply inequitable. Working-class families in neighborhoods from Southeast Queens to Staten Island often pay three times the property taxes of owners of multimillion-dollar brownstones in Manhattan. As Comptroller, Justin will push for comprehensive reform to ensure a fairer, more transparent system that works for all New Yorkers. He will advocate for phasing out outdated caps on assessed value growth, creating new classifications for co-ops and condos, and implementing a property tax circuit breaker to ensure no one is overly burdened by their tax bill. These changes will ease the financial strain on working families, protect vulnerable homeowners, and bring fairness to a broken system that has long favored the wealthy few. Ensuring Digital Equity Access to reliable internet is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity. With one in four NYC households still lacking fixed broadband and affordability remaining a significant barrier, Justin will take action as Comptroller to close the digital divide. He will ensure city investments prioritize expanding high-speed broadband to under-resourced communities and demand accountability from providers to deliver affordable, reliable internet. he will push for smarter contracts that address disparities in access and cost, ensuring students, small businesses, and families in every borough have the connectivity they need to thrive in today’s digital world.

He will use the power of the Comptroller’s office to audit the New York City Department of Education and ensure every dollar spent enhances classrooms, supports teachers, and improves outcomes for students. He will work to expand school-based services like mental health support and after-school programs to better serve families and mandate arts and music instruction in every public school, ensuring students receive a well-rounded education. Addressing Carter Cases and Supporting Families Carter Cases place an extraordinary burden on families of students with disabilities and the private schools that serve them, as they often face significant delays in receiving payments for essential services. As Councilman, Justin introduced legislation to create a revolving loan fund that would provide interest-free, two-year loans to eligible private schools awaiting payments under settlement agreements or due process orders. This innovative approach ensures that schools can continue to support students with disabilities while waiting for reimbursement. As Comptroller, Justin will build on this work by ensuring the Department of Education manages Carter Case funds efficiently and transparently, reducing delays and ensuring families and schools get the support they need without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.

As Comptroller, he will work to expand access to CUNY programs, ensuring they remain affordable and responsive to the needs of a changing workforce. By investing in CUNY, Justin will help prepare the next generation of New Yorkers for success. Fighting Food Insecurity Food insecurity remains a pressing issue in New York City, with many families struggling to put meals on the table. As Comptroller, Justin will prioritize city investments in programs that combat hunger, such as funding for food pantries, school meal programs, and urban agriculture initiatives. He will hold agencies accountable for delivering resources to communities in need. Fixing New York City’s Broken Property Tax System New York City’s property tax system is outdated, unfair, and deeply inequitable. Working-class families in neighborhoods from Southeast Queens to Staten Island often pay three times the property taxes of owners of multimillion-dollar brownstones in Manhattan. As Comptroller, Justin will push for comprehensive reform to ensure a fairer, more transparent system that works for all New Yorkers. He will advocate for phasing out outdated caps on assessed value growth, creating new classifications for co-ops and condos, and implementing a property tax circuit breaker to ensure no one is overly burdened by their tax bill. These changes will ease the financial strain on working families, protect vulnerable homeowners, and bring fairness to a broken system that has long favored the wealthy few. Ensuring Digital Equity Access to reliable internet is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity. With one in four NYC households still lacking fixed broadband and affordability remaining a significant barrier, Justin will take action as Comptroller to close the digital divide. He will ensure city investments prioritize expanding high-speed broadband to under-resourced communities and demand accountability from providers to deliver affordable, reliable internet. he will push for smarter contracts that address disparities in access and cost, ensuring students, small businesses, and families in every borough have the connectivity they need to thrive in today’s digital world. Protecting Public School Budgets Justin knows education is the key to New York City’s future. He will use the power of the Comptroller’s office to audit the New York City Department of Education and ensure every dollar spent enhances classrooms, supports teachers, and improves outcomes for students. He will work to expand school-based services like mental health support and after-school programs to better serve families and mandate arts and music instruction in every public school, ensuring students receive a well-rounded education. Addressing Carter Cases and Supporting Families Carter Cases place an extraordinary burden on families of students with disabilities and the private schools that serve them, as they often face significant delays in receiving payments for essential services. As Councilman, Justin introduced legislation to create a revolving loan fund that would provide interest-free, two-year loans to eligible private schools awaiting payments under settlement agreements or due process orders. This innovative approach ensures that schools can continue to support students with disabilities while waiting for reimbursement. As Comptroller, Justin will build on this work by ensuring the Department of Education manages Carter Case funds efficiently and transparently, reducing delays and ensuring families and schools get the support they need without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. Small Business Recovery and Support As a former small business owner and currently the husband of a small business owner, Justin knows better than most that our local mom & pop shops are truly the backbone of New York City’s economy. As Comptroller, Justin will ensure city contracts prioritize local businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. He will audit and improve programs aimed at cutting red tape, providing grants, and ensuring storefronts stay open in"

Unlocking Capital for New York City’s Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses New York City has set laudable goals to increase M/WBE contracts but the challenges and disparities faced by these entrepreneurs have only gotten worse.

Companies run by women and minorities are often smaller and younger and already face significant hurdles when it comes to accessing and successfully obtaining government contracts.

To combat climate change, Justin knows cities need to do more than just mandate cleaner fuels in buildings, and support infrastructure for cleaner forms of transportation like public transit, walking, and biking. Moving forward, any serious national debate on the environment must be centered around a comprehensive approach that includes curbing the consumption of meat. New York City is a center of consumption and we must look at the food we purchase for our schools, prisons, and hospitals as another tool in our arsenal to address climate change.

Justin has always been on the front lines of this fight, making sure programs like after-school and early childhood education are fully funded. As Comptroller, Justin will hold city agencies accountable for delivering equitable outcomes, push for fair wages, and invest in programs that raise up underrepresented communities. He will ensure the city’s budget works to narrow the wealth gap and make New York livable for all families – not just the wealthy few.

Divesting NYC Pensions from Tesla Elon Musk is using his wealth and political influence to attack the very programs that NYC retirees rely on—gutting Social Security, slashing veterans’ benefits, and pulling millions in federal funding from our city. As Comptroller, Justin Brannan will push to fully divest the City’s $1.2 billion pension investment in Tesla. Musk’s dangerous behavior and volatile leadership make Tesla a financial and ethical risk to our pension system. NYC should not be investing in an unelected oligarch working against our seniors, our veterans, and our values.

Creating a First in the Nation Universal Childcare System Justin knows that raising a family in New York City can feel impossibly hard, and working families deserve real solutions to the challenges they face. As Finance Chair, he stood up against proposed cuts to early childhood education and after-school programs, making sure working parents had the support they needed. But he knows more must be done. Universal childcare wouldn’t just be a gamechanger for working families, it would be a gamechanger for our economy. Justin has been a champion for creating a universal child care system for many years. As Comptroller, Justin will work to identify the necessary funding to ensure that every family has access to high-quality childcare. This bold initiative will help parents stay in the workforce, give children the foundation they need to thrive, and make New York City a place where families can build their futures.

Procurement Reform (No Procurement, No Peace!) New York City needs to pay their damn bills on time. Our non-profit organizations are the unsung heroes of this city and yet most struggle to stay afloat as they wait to get paid for services they’ve already delivered. The city entrusts these non-profit organizations to perform critical work but then can’t be bothered to reimburse their costs. Meanwhile, across town, taxpayers are aghast to learn the bathroom in their local park playground will cost several million dollars to renovate. All of this can be fixed through procurement reform. Justin has spent his career ensuring taxpayer dollars work as hard as New Yorkers do. He knows the city’s procurement process is busted and broken, plagued by inefficiency, delays, and a lack of transparency. Too often, critical projects are held up, and New Yorkers in need are left hanging as non-profit providers are asked to do even more with even less. These vital organizations who so often serve our city’s most vulnerable shouldn’t have to take out high-interest loans to pay their staff while they wait to get paid back by the city.

That’s why he wrote the law that bars anyone convicted of public corruption from ever running for office again – because if you betray the public’s trust, you don't get a second chance at being an elected official. He believes public service is a public trust and that our government should work for the people, not the well-connected. Justin will keep fighting for tougher ethics laws, real accountability, and transparency at every level – especially when it comes to your hard-earned tax dollars.

In the merciless winter cold and summer heat, people experiencing homelessness routinely seek shelter by riding the subways to the end of the line stations where there is a longer layover. Outreach workers attempt to coax people into accepting shelter and other services but the overtures are typically rejected over and over again. The fact that someone would rather spend the day riding the subway back and forth instead of accepting shelter and medical care is an indictment on the entire system. As Comptroller, Justin will push for better mental health services, smarter outreach in the transit system to help those in crisis, changes to the involuntary removal and commitment rules, and more safe haven beds. He will also advocate for increased staffing of station agents and unarmed transit personnel, and ensure a visible police presence that focuses on deterrence and support rather than escalation. Finally, we need to be moving people suffering from serious mental illness off the subways and directly into permanent supportive housing. By combining smart investments with accountability, Justin will work to restore safety and trust in our subway system. Ensuring Safety in Our Subways Ensuring Safety in Our Subways Our subway system is the lifeblood of New York City, and every rider deserves to feel safe.

New York City can and must do more to ensure healthy communities and a sustainable climate for years to come. To combat climate change, Justin knows cities need to do more than just mandate cleaner fuels in buildings, and support infrastructure for cleaner forms of transportation like public transit, walking, and biking. Moving forward, any serious national debate on the environment must be centered around a comprehensive approach that includes curbing the consumption of meat. New York City is a center of consumption and we must look at the food we purchase for our schools, prisons, and hospitals as another tool in our arsenal to address climate change.

And since being elected, Justin has done that – bringing back over $250 million to his community through direct investments in the programs and priorities that help neighborhoods thrive. As Finance Chair, he fought to protect and expand the programs New Yorkers rely on most. When the Mayor proposed cruel cuts to libraries, early childhood education, cultural institutions, and after-school programs, Justin said, “Hell no!” and won. Now, as a candidate for New York City Comptroller, Justin is ready to take his fight for working families citywide. He’s committed to using the power of the Comptroller’s office to tackle affordability because he knows working families aren’t just struggling – they’re leaving. So every dollar of our $115 billion budget should go toward making life more livable. From public safety to affordability to your everyday quality of life, Justin’s vision for New York City focuses on bold, transformative solutions to the daily challenges working families face.

Justin will develop a dedicated NYC Workers Housing Plan to create truly affordable housing options for city employees – teachers, nurses, sanitation workers, first responders, and all those who work hard to keep this city running. As the son and husband of a teacher, Justin fiercely believes in fully investing in CUNY and ensuring it remains accessible and affordable. But Justin believes in big ideas and sweating the small stuff like getting potholes filled and making sure your garbage gets picked up on time. From growing pensions and securing dignified retirements for city workers to investing in underserved communities and auditing programs for effectiveness, Justin is laser-focused on building a city where families don’t just survive – they thrive.

His mom an early childhood educator, his wife an artist and small business owner, Justin grew up in the same public schools, parks, and playgrounds he now works to improve. Justin believes that before you can change the world, you have to start by making a difference in your own backyard. And since being elected, Justin has done that – bringing back over $250 million to his community through direct investments in the programs and priorities that help neighborhoods thrive. As Finance Chair, he fought to protect and expand the programs New Yorkers rely on most. When the Mayor proposed cruel cuts to libraries, early childhood education, cultural institutions, and after-school programs, Justin said, “Hell no!” and won. Now, as a candidate for New York City Comptroller, Justin is ready to take his fight for working families citywide. He’s committed to using the power of the Comptroller’s office to tackle affordability because he knows working families aren’t just struggling – they’re leaving. So every dollar of our $115 billion budget should go toward making life more livable. From public safety to affordability to your everyday quality of life, Justin’s vision for New York City focuses on bold, transformative solutions to the daily challenges working families face. Justin is committed to fighting for a universal child care system, so no parent has to choose between paying rent and affording quality childcare. Justin will develop a dedicated NYC Workers Housing Plan to create truly affordable housing options for city employees – teachers, nurses, sanitation workers, first responders, and all those who work hard to keep this city running. As the son and husband of a teacher, Justin fiercely believes in fully investing in CUNY and ensuring it remains accessible and affordable. But Justin believes in big ideas and sweating the small stuff like getting potholes filled and making sure your garbage gets picked up on time. From growing pensions and securing dignified retirements for city workers to investing in underserved communities and auditing programs for effectiveness, Justin is laser-focused on building a city where families don’t just survive – they thrive. With Justin as Comptroller, New York City’s budget will reflect its values: resilient, bold, and built for everyone .
