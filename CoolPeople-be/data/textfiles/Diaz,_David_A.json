He was 82. “You sent him out, you knew you were gonna get the story,” CBS News New York associate producer Wanda Prisinzano said. Few details were provided about the veteran reporter’s death . According to CBS, he died last week, but a specific timeframe was not available. His cause of death was also unclear, though family members have previously said he’d been living with a form of dementia in recent years that diminished his ability to communicate. Diaz, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1942, was just 3 years old when his family moved to Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan. He grew up there and attended Fordham Prep before going graduating from City College, and then Columbia University, where he earned his masters in journalism. An activist and community advocate, Diaz kicked off his career as a newspaper reporter before moving on-air with the NBC-owned WNBC. After nearly 15 years with the station, Diaz pivoted to CBS New York , where he worked for another 12 years before his departure in 2005 An award-winning journalist , he covered breaking news events across the five boroughs, including the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, in addition to presidential elections and other national events. Diaz spent his later years as a lecturer at CUNY , where he taught mass media and politics and journalism, according to his LinkedIn profile. David Diaz (CBS) CBS Evening News anchor Maurice Dubois remembered his former colleague as a “reporter’s reporter” and a “New York City guy,” who was “hard scrabble” while still striving to “bring others up as well.” CBS News New York’s Jennifer Jones echoed the sentiment, declaring Diaz a “legend.” “He understood New York City like very few journalist know and that was David Diaz,” CBS News New York anchor Mary Calvi added. “He was a consummate professional, a charming, charming man.” Diaz is survived by his daughters, Elena, Nina,"
