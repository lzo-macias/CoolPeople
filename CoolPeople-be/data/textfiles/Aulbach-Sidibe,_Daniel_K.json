We must fight the housing affordability crisis from the perspective of tenants and small property owners. The City Council should be creating incentive programs to attract great tenants and ways to protect both homeowners and tenants from the ravages of the market. Our goal must be to find ways to keep housing affordable for local people while allowing homeowners to stay afloat amid rising prices surrounding home ownership. Additionally, we need to be advocates for public housing residents as they navigate the system and help them to access programs and services to give them the resources they need to live better within public housing while building opportunities for them to be successful in other types of supportive housing situations. In the City Council, I will work to protect and expand cultural institutions and celebrate the rich and diverse culture, artistic history, and landscape of our Community Board’s borders. I want us to have more events like the E152 Puerto Rican Festival and bring our community’s newest members to the table, the Garifuna People, West Africans, and Dominicans among others.
