CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAMPAIGN Public Safety Safety is a fundamental right for all individuals—whether it’s personal safety, home security, or protecting businesses. As a former NYPD officer, I’m committed to tackling random street crime, safeguarding businesses, and improving public transit safety through proactive measures. Our community’s safety and quality of life have deteriorated due to failed policies that have fueled crime and lawlessness. As your District 25 council member, I’ll demand better services from our police, sanitation, and city agencies, and push back against policies that weaken law enforcement. I’ll fight to ensure our police force has the necessary personnel and training to address crime effectively while maintaining professionalism and integrity. We must respect the unique needs of all communities, particularly marginalized ones, to ensure fair policing for everyone. I will advocate for the repeal of harmful policies like Cashless Bail, Raise the Age, and discovery laws that let criminals go free. I’ll also push for a more humane, modernized Rikers Island, as borough-based jails only worsen quality of life in surrounding communities. With your support, I will be the Councilman who unites our community with integrity, compassion, and real solutions. Roosevelt Avenue Crisis Roosevelt Avenue is a key connection for District 25, including communities like Corona, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Woodside, and Flushing, but it's facing serious crime due to gang activity and human trafficking. Last summer, I joined the \"Let’s Improve Roosevelt Avenue Coalition\" and successfully secured additional law enforcement for our local precincts. This effort led to positive changes for small businesses and residents, but we still need more improvements. We must continue to push for better quality of life and stricter enforcement against illegal activities like prostitution, unlicensed vendors, and shoplifting. As your next City Council member, I’ll continue advocating for safety on Roosevelt Avenue, combat prostitution, and work to provide safe housing and job alternatives for exploited workers. I will ensure that pimps and traffickers are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I oppose decriminalizing prostitution and legalizing \"sex work\" as a regulated industry. Our focus should be on eradicating human trafficking and exploitation. Recap: Operation Restore Roosevelt Avenue (90-Day Results) 985 arrests, 134 for prostitution-related offenses 11,831 summonses 464 confiscated vehicles (including 419 illegal ATVs and motorcycles) 292 building inspections, leading to 18 vacate orders 522 vendor inspections, 94 propane tanks seized, 15,000 lbs of food donated 223 engagements with homeless individuals. Mental Health Crisis Recent violent incidents in our subway system, buses, and public spaces are closely linked to the worsening mental health crisis. Many of the homeless, including veterans with mental health issues, have been neglected. While we’ve reduced homeless veterans by 83% in the past decade, we still face a serious problem. Our city is in a mental health emergency, and we can’t let subways and jails be the only options for our most vulnerable citizens. Deinstitutionalization has failed, and we need reinstitutionalization. I will advocate for reopening and expanding Creedmoor Mental Facility and creating more facilities to provide a safe space for those in distress. I will ensure proper funding for homeless services to help individuals get back on their feet. I believe in accountability and transparency—simply throwing money at the problem won’t solve it. I’ll ensure regular audits of NGOs and demand that funds be used effectively to support those in need. I will fight for safer subways, buses, and services that help the homeless regain their dignity and provide opportunity. Education Access to quality education should not be determined by one's zip code or background, including immigration status. The Supreme Court was very clear in Plyler v. Doe that all children are entitled to a public education regardless of their immigration status. Having navigated the educational system as an immigrant and having served as a school volunteer, former PTA President and current School Leadership Team member, I understand firsthand the transformative power of education. It is imperative to equip all students with the necessary resources and opportunities for success, regardless of their circumstances. I am advocating for human solutions which will minimize harm to children and allow them to continue their education unabated. I will not advocate for defunding our schools or our public libraries. Instead, I will fight for the creation of additional adequate after school programs which will inspire our children to be innovative and free thinkers"

Roosevelt Avenue Crisis Roosevelt Avenue is a key connection for District 25, including communities like Corona, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Woodside, and Flushing, but it's facing serious crime due to gang activity and human trafficking. Last summer, I joined the \"Let’s Improve Roosevelt Avenue Coalition\" and successfully secured additional law enforcement for our local precincts. This effort led to positive changes for small businesses and residents, but we still need more improvements. We must continue to push for better quality of life and stricter enforcement against illegal activities like prostitution, unlicensed vendors, and shoplifting. As your next City Council member, I’ll continue advocating for safety on Roosevelt Avenue, combat prostitution, and work to provide safe housing and job alternatives for exploited workers. I will ensure that pimps and traffickers are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I oppose decriminalizing prostitution and legalizing \"sex work\" as a regulated industry. Our focus should be on eradicating human trafficking and exploitation. Recap: Operation Restore Roosevelt Avenue (90-Day Results) 985 arrests, 134 for prostitution-related offenses 11,831 summonses 464 confiscated vehicles (including 419 illegal ATVs and motorcycles) 292 building inspections, leading to 18 vacate orders 522 vendor inspections, 94 propane tanks seized, 15,000 lbs of food donated 223 engagements with homeless individuals. Mental Health Crisis Recent violent incidents in our subway system, buses, and public spaces are closely linked to the worsening mental health crisis. Many of the homeless, including veterans with mental health issues, have been neglected. While we’ve reduced homeless veterans by 83% in the past decade, we still face a serious problem. Our city is in a mental health emergency, and we can’t let subways and jails be the only options for our most vulnerable citizens. Deinstitutionalization has failed, and we need reinstitutionalization. I will advocate for reopening and expanding Creedmoor Mental Facility and creating more facilities to provide a safe space for those in distress. I will ensure proper funding for homeless services to help individuals get back on their feet. I believe in accountability and transparency—simply throwing money at the problem won’t solve it. I’ll ensure regular audits of NGOs and demand that funds be used effectively to support those in need. I will fight for safer subways, buses, and services that help the homeless regain their dignity and provide opportunity. Education Access to quality education should not be determined by one's zip code or background, including immigration status. The Supreme Court was very clear in Plyler v. Doe that all children are entitled to a public education regardless of their immigration status. Having navigated the educational system as an immigrant and having served as a school volunteer, former PTA President and current School Leadership Team member, I understand firsthand the transformative power of education. It is imperative to equip all students with the necessary resources and opportunities for success, regardless of their circumstances. I am advocating for human solutions which will minimize harm to children and allow them to continue their education unabated. I will not advocate for defunding our schools or our public libraries. Instead, I will fight for the creation of additional adequate after school programs which will inspire our children to be innovative and free thinkers"

Ricardo's dedication to his daughter mirrored the sacrifices made by his own mother, instilling in him a deep sense of empathy and compassion. A Champion for Change: Retiring from the NYPD in 2016, Ricardo remained active in his community, serving as President of his co-op board and advocating for cooperative initiatives.
