I will fight to ensure housing, benefits, and services go to New Yorkers who have earned them—not to those gaming the system. Freeze Property Taxes for Long-Term Seniors We must protect our senior citizens. I will push to freeze property taxes for New Yorkers over 65 who have lived in our communities for an extended period so they can afford to stay in the city they helped build. Expand Access to Fair Fares NYC Fair Fares NYC is supposed to help low-income and senior New Yorkers afford public transportation, but only 34% of eligible residents are using it. I will expand outreach and simplify the application process so more people can ride the subways and buses without breaking the bank. Stand Up to Radical Green Mandates That Hurt Working Families I will not let out-of-touch environmental policies punish everyday New Yorkers. I will fight against costly green mandates that raise utility bills, force unnecessary household regulations, and burden families with fines. We need practical, common-sense solutions—not climate virtue signaling that makes life more expensive. Lower Food and Business Costs Through Co-ops and Buying Power Food prices are out of control. I will support more food co-ops and warehouse clubs citywide, subsidize memberships for low-income residents, and promote small business buying co-ops to lower prices and empower our communities. Reduce and Eliminate Everyday Taxes From bag fees to phone surcharges and utility taxes, the cost of living keeps rising. I will eliminate unnecessary everyday taxes and block new ones. The city should live within its means—not squeeze working people. Public Safety Zero-Tolerance Safety Zones Designate schools, parks, shopping areas, and subways as Zero-Tolerance Zones, including for shoplifting. Increase patrols, improve lighting, expand surveillance, and enforce penalties to protect families. Fix Our Subways and Public Spaces Deploy NYPD and trained social workers to remove violent offenders and the severely mentally ill from transit hubs. Enforce fare payment to stop the flow of weapons and crime into the subways. Protect Women, Seniors, and Vulnerable Riders Crack down on harassment, assault, and hate crimes with tougher enforcement—especially in transit and public spaces. Neighborhood Patrol and Community Watch Launch local patrols with civic groups and retired officers to strengthen safety and trust without added taxpayer cost. Combat Auto and Package Theft Create a crime task force targeting auto break-ins, catalytic converter theft, and organized package theft rings. Deport Violent Criminals Partner with the Trump administration to deport violent non-citizen criminals. New Yorkers deserve safe streets—starting with removing repeat offenders who have no legal right to be here. Protect Pedestrians and Improve Traffic Safety Enhance crosswalks, enforce traffic laws, and penalize reckless drivers. Improve traffic signals and smart systems to reduce congestion—without taxing drivers through Congestion Pricing. Back the NYPD Restore qualified immunity and support our officers. Reverse bail reform and pro-criminal policies that have made our city less safe. Enough is enough. Hire and Retain More Police Officers Recruit more officers and deploy them where they’re needed most. Retain experienced officers by providing the respect and compensation they deserve. Seniors Protect Retiree Healthcare Support City Council Bill 1096 (check this bill) and oppose replacing traditional Medicare with Medicare Advantage for NYC retirees. Honor Promises Made Protect the benefits promised to city workers. We must uphold our obligations to those who served our city. Preserve Doctor-Patient Relationships Medicare Advantage plans risk disrupting care. Retirees should never fear losing access to trusted healthcare providers. Housing Say NO to the City of Yes Mayor Adams’ plan gives too much to developers and bypasses local voices. We want growth that reflects real community needs without changing neighborhood character. Support a Range of Housing Options Create housing for people at all stages of life—including smaller, affordable units for those just starting out. Protect Small Homeowners, Not Slumlords Provide fair processes for small landlords dealing with non-paying tenants. Treat small homeowners differently than corporate landlords in housing court.

I will expand outreach and simplify the application process so more people can ride the subways and buses without breaking the bank. Stand Up to Radical Green Mandates That Hurt Working Families I will not let out-of-touch environmental policies punish everyday New Yorkers. I will fight against costly green mandates that raise utility bills, force unnecessary household regulations, and burden families with fines. We need practical, common-sense solutions—not climate virtue signaling that makes life more expensive. Lower Food and Business Costs Through Co-ops and Buying Power Food prices are out of control. I will support more food co-ops and warehouse clubs citywide, subsidize memberships for low-income residents, and promote small business buying co-ops to lower prices and empower our communities. Reduce and Eliminate Everyday Taxes From bag fees to phone surcharges and utility taxes, the cost of living keeps rising. I will eliminate unnecessary everyday taxes and block new ones. The city should live within its means—not squeeze working people. Public Safety Zero-Tolerance Safety Zones Designate schools, parks, shopping areas, and subways as Zero-Tolerance Zones, including for shoplifting. Increase patrols, improve lighting, expand surveillance, and enforce penalties to protect families. Fix Our Subways and Public Spaces Deploy NYPD and trained social workers to remove violent offenders and the severely mentally ill from transit hubs. Enforce fare payment to stop the flow of weapons and crime into the subways. Protect Women, Seniors, and Vulnerable Riders Crack down on harassment, assault, and hate crimes with tougher enforcement—especially in transit and public spaces. Neighborhood Patrol and Community Watch Launch local patrols with civic groups and retired officers to strengthen safety and trust without added taxpayer cost. Combat Auto and Package Theft Create a crime task force targeting auto break-ins, catalytic converter theft, and organized package theft rings. Deport Violent Criminals Partner with the Trump administration to deport violent non-citizen criminals. New Yorkers deserve safe streets—starting with removing repeat offenders who have no legal right to be here. Protect Pedestrians and Improve Traffic Safety Enhance crosswalks, enforce traffic laws, and penalize reckless drivers. Improve traffic signals and smart systems to reduce congestion—without taxing drivers through Congestion Pricing. Back the NYPD Restore qualified immunity and support our officers. Reverse bail reform and pro-criminal policies that have made our city less safe. Enough is enough. Hire and Retain More Police Officers Recruit more officers and deploy them where they’re needed most. Retain experienced officers by providing the respect and compensation they deserve. Seniors Protect Retiree Healthcare Support City Council Bill 1096 (check this bill) and oppose replacing traditional Medicare with Medicare Advantage for NYC retirees. Honor Promises Made Protect the benefits promised to city workers. We must uphold our obligations to those who served our city. Preserve Doctor-Patient Relationships Medicare Advantage plans risk disrupting care. Retirees should never fear losing access to trusted healthcare providers. Housing Say NO to the City of Yes Mayor Adams’ plan gives too much to developers and bypasses local voices. We want growth that reflects real community needs without changing neighborhood character.
