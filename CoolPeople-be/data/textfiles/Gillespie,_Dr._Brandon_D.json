The Man Behind the Blue Glasses Report this article Dr. Brandon G. Dr. Brandon G. Therapist | Psychology Professor | Journalist/Content Creator Published Mar 26, 2025 + Follow At home in East Harlem, Dr. Brandon Gillespie — who goes by Dr. Brandon, sits by his west-facing window, sunlight spilling across the floor and catching the corners of his signature blue glasses. It's a moment of pause, but outside — just blocks away — the campaign is moving. On the streets of Harlem, where he's often seen looking over his shoulder at the city he loves, he walks with the people, grounded by his roots and looking ahead with purpose. The light is warm, steady — like the way he leads: with calm resolve and quiet confidence. “I needed light to thrive,” he says, smiling. “That was non-negotiable. I knew New York would stretch me — but I needed sunlight to grow.” That quiet insistence on thriving, not just surviving, has marked every stop on Gillespie’s journey — from marching in protests as a child in Dallas alongside his mother and civil rights leaders like Commissioner John Wiley Price, to coming of age in the cultural crucible of Howard University, to finally becoming a therapist, educator, and media voice in Harlem, where he’s now running to become New York City’s next mayor. “Dallas taught me to stand up,” he says. “DC taught me who I am. And Harlem? Harlem taught me how to love.” Dr. Gillespie didn’t plan to run for mayor — not yet, anyway. His dreams were expansive: a national talk show, global influence, maybe even the White House one day. But something in New York — in the exhaustion of watching his students struggle, in the disconnect on the streets, in the heaviness of the cost of just being — began to stir something deeper. “I became restless,” he says. “I got tired of just talking about change in my classroom or online. I couldn’t sleep. I knew I was being called to do something more.” It was a conversation with a friend that first planted the seed of a mayoral run. At first, he dismissed it. “I laughed and said, ‘No, I’m focused on the national campaign down the road,’” he says, smiling. “But then I prayed about it. I talked to my parents. I went to church — a church I don’t even normally attend — and that day, two city council members were sitting right next to me. I thought: am I sitting with my future co-workers?” The answer, he decided, was yes. And so the campaign began — not out of ambition, but out of necessity. “The cost of living in New York is what keeps me up at night,” he says, his voice tightening. “It’s not just the dollars and cents — it’s the weight of stress. It changes how people talk to each other, how they treat one another. You can live in a city of 8.4 million people and feel completely alone. That’s not okay.” Recommended by LinkedIn Wobbly Wednesday, Windowless Dorms Ken Steele 3 years ago The Burden We're Willing to Carry Mark Greer 2 years ago Healthcare’s Gettysburg Moment David Johnson 8 years ago Gillespie brings something rare to politics: a trauma-informed lens, rooted in emotional awareness and an understanding of how systemic stress shapes everyday life. As a therapist and professor, he sees how systems — housing, education, healthcare, policing — affect the nervous system. How poverty is trauma. How survival mode hardens hearts. How joy can be an act of resistance. “Joy belongs in politics,” he says plainly. “Joy belongs everywhere. I tell my clients they should feel joy every single day. And when"

Therapist | Psychology Professor | Journalist/Content Creator At home in East Harlem, Dr. Brandon Gillespie — who goes by Dr. Brandon, sits by his west-facing window, sunlight spilling across the floor and catching the corners of his signature blue glasses. It's a moment of pause, but outside — just blocks away — the campaign is moving. On the streets of Harlem, where he's often seen looking over his shoulder at the city he loves, he walks with the people, grounded by his roots and looking ahead with purpose. The light is warm, steady — like the way he leads: with calm resolve and quiet confidence.

I knew New York would stretch me — but I needed sunlight to grow.” “I needed light to thrive,” he says, smiling. “That was non-negotiable. I knew New York would stretch me — but I needed sunlight to grow.” That quiet insistence on thriving, not just surviving, has marked every stop on Gillespie’s journey — from marching in protests as a child in Dallas alongside his mother and civil rights leaders like Commissioner John Wiley Price, to coming of age in the cultural crucible of Howard University, to finally becoming a therapist, educator, and media voice in Harlem, where he’s now running to become New York City’s next mayor.

It’s found in the lives he touches — the students who heal, the neighbors who feel seen, the city that begins to believe in itself again. It’s in persistence. In joy. In the belief that even the most ambitious dreams — the ones whispered in third grade classrooms and carried through decades of work — can manifest with hope, community, and bold faith.
