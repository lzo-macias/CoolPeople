We thank her for her tireless dedication to the children. I was delighted to present my historic resolution recognizing Woodhaven’s 187th Birthday to the Woodhaven Residents’ Block Association. Woodhaven is one of the last remaining authentic neighborhoods in this city. I was proud to lead the State Assembly in honoring my community. I was out today at the 106 Precinct Gun Violence Awareness event. There were nearly 800 shooting victims in NYC this year. 125 children die each year from gun accidents & 70 women are fatally shot by an intimate partner every month. I’m committed to immediate legislative action. Baseball legend Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto represents the journey from scrappy roots to worldwide greatness. I was proud to speak at the street co-naming in his honor in his hometown right here in Glendale. I represent the world's most linguistically diverse area, and proudly join in celebrating Int'l #MotherLanguageDay, recognizing the need for inclusion of native languages. I’m proud of my record on language access, including in Bengali, whose language movement inspired this day. It was another incredible night catching up with my neighbors at their doors. Carolina came outside to discuss DOT issues. #GovernmentAtYourDoor Back in Albany for the start of the legislative session! After a year of unprecedented crisis in our state, I’m looking forward to helping us rebuild. Today was one of the highlights of my first term in office. I partnered with Joe Caruana & Community Care Food Pantry to serve fresh food to over 100 constituents at my office. Having an opportunity to serve my constituents, see them & talk with them made this snowy day one of the highlights of my first term so far. Proud to attend the lease signing ceremony of the historic Neirs Tavern, right here in the heart of Woodhaven. This is a model of how leaders can come together to save our small businesses. Through negotiation, intervention & corporation, Neirs Tavern will remain open for business. Congratulations to owner Loycent Gordon. I’d like to thank the entire community for their outpouring of love. Three rooms of my office are now filled top to bottom with donations for the victims of the Richmond Hill Fire. Thank you also to the all-star team of community leaders that made this possible. I’d like to thank the entire community for their outpouring of love.

I am proud to have introduced a resolution in the State Assembly making Punjabi Awareness Day in the State of New York. I was overjoyed to get my constituent her vaccination appointment! She stopped by today to print out her appointment papers and head off to the vaccination site. 1 Video"
