She grew up in East New York, Brooklyn and has lived in Sunset Park for nearly two decades. As City Council Member for District 38 — representing Red Hook and parts of Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, Dyker Heights, and Bath Beach — Alexa fights for well-resourced schools; safe and equitable school reopenings; dignified, affordable housing; equity and justice for our immigrant neighbors; and a Green New Deal for New York. Alexa has led with passion, sensibility, pragmatism, and an unwavering commitment to District 38 residents and will continue to with your support. Fully Funded Education A former PTA president, Alexa has long organized for full investment in our public schools. During her time in City Council, Alexa stood strong against Mayor Eric Adams’s cuts to education, restoring millions in funding for our schools. She will continue to fight for public education — from pre-K to CUNY. Universal, Safe, and Dignified Housing Housing is a human right. Since joining the New York City Council, Alexa has fought the wealthy developers and politicians who want to make this city a playground for the rich. She’s passed legislation that protects tenants from illegal evictions, holds private companies accountable for the quality of our city’s public housing, and will continue to stand with tenants against rent hikes. A Brooklyn We Can All Afford Working-class families are fleeing New York City over costs, while more millionaires than ever are moving to the city. We must stop the exodus of working New Yorkers from the city. Alexa is fighting for a New York that we can all afford.

As a proud Boricua, education organizer, mother, and democratic socialist, she is driven by service — to her community, to her family, and to New York City. Since joining the New York City Council in 2022, Alexa has stood strong for the communities of South Brooklyn fighting for housing for all, fully funded public schools, and a people-centered budget at City Hall. She’s sponsored dozens of bills that deliver for District 38 residents, and fights for a city government that works for the working class. A product of East New York, Brooklyn, Alexa is fueled by her family’s struggles, resilience, and deep commitment to service. As a child, Alexa watched her mother help young people rebuild their lives after experiencing poverty, incarceration, and substance-abuse disorders. Her mother’s strength laid a solid foundation of love and hope for Alexa’s family and for her relationship with her community. It also inspired her vision for a better Brooklyn and a better New York City. Building and using the collective power of her communities is at the core of this vision. The first in her family to attend college, Alexa graduated from Columbia University, then from Baruch College’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. Alexa has dedicated her career to community philanthropy, working to keep young people and adults out of our country’s criminal injustice system. She is also an organizer and activist who has continually supported the revitalization of native cultures and languages. Before joining the Council, she most recently served as the Program Director for the Scherman Foundation, funding local and national organizations working on human rights, the arts, and NYC community issues. Alexa has been proud to serve her community on a local level. Alexa served as the PS 172 PTA president for a decade, partnering with other parents to build programs, address families’ needs, and support neighborhood children. She was also a member of her local Community Board 7, served as a Parent Representative of the M.S. 88 School Leadership Team, and chaired the New York City Youth Board. She is also a member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America, and volunteered both as the Chair of the Personnel and Internal Budget Committee and as Vice-Chair of the Youth and Education Committee on Brooklyn Community Board 7. As a Latina, a mom, and your neighbor, Alexa is sensible and pragmatic. Alexa’s husband Frankie is a TWU Local 101 Member and lifelong resident of Red Hook and Sunset Park, and her intensely political daughters fuel her drive to build a better world.

Since her election in 2021, she has secured major investments for District 38 and working-class New Yorkers across the city — from restoring hundreds of millions in education funding, to securing multi-million dollar investments for neighborhood parks like Rainbow Playground and Martin Luther Park. She has also led the charge for major legislative victories for working-class Brooklyn — from protecting tenants after devastating fires, to taking on corporate polluters and fighting for clean air for our communities. And she’s fought against Mayor Adams’s reckless cuts to vital city services, demanding full funding for education, libraries, sanitation and parks. Ready for a New York City that works for the workers, not the ultra-wealthy? Read our 2025 platform and see how our movement is building a city that works for the many, not the few. Councilmember Alexa Avilés fights for education justice and public education. Quality & Equitable Education for All Alexa has spent her entire career fighting for education justice — from her time as PS 172’s PTA president, to her work as Parent Representative of the M.S. 88 School Leadership Team. She has continued to champion public education since taking office, and was one of few council members to vote against Eric Adams’s major cuts to the city’s education budget. Here’s how we’ll guarantee education for all New Yorkers. What we’ve accomplished: Fought Eric Adams’s disastrous cuts to the education budget: When Eric Adams attempted to gut funding for schools and educators, Alexa fought back against his cuts, restoring millions in cuts to public schools and childcare programs. Improved education spaces and playgrounds : Alexa has invested in schools and schoolyards across the district — such as the green Community Schoolyard at the P.S. 503 and P.S. 506 joint campus. The playground, built with green infrastructure, not only provides recreation space for students, it also will absorb ​​620,000 gallons of runoff annually, helping to reduce flooding in the neighborhood. Secured $4 million investment to develop a Latine Studies Curriculum Initiative: Alexa worked with community partners to secure funding for a Latine curriculum for NYC public schools. In a moment when MAGA lawmakers are banning books and erasing history from schools, Alexa fought to make sure the culturally-relevant education has a home in our city’s public schools. Invested in parks and green spaces: Alexa tackled District 38’s aging park infrastructure, and created more safe playground spaces for our district’s young people. She helped turn an underused concrete softball field into a popular state-of-the-art skate park in Red Hook’s Harold Ickes Playground. She secured $1.6 million to renovate Sunset Park’s Rainbow Playground, and is fighting for other park improvements in places like Pena Herrera Playground in Sunset Park. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term: Fight for universal childcare : Alexa will support the creation of a citywide Office of Childcare , tasked with creating free childcare for all NYC residents. She will fight for fully funding Pre-K and 3-K programs, rejecting cuts to early childcare and education. Fully fund education: While Trump and Musk want to dismantle public education, Alexa will champion fully investing in our schools and educators. She will reject cuts to our public education system and fight for more investments in multilingual learners, English-language learners, arts, and services for students with learning and physical disabilities. Stop ICE from entering our schools: While Eric Adams tries to undermine long-standing immigration laws in our city, Alexa will make sure teachers, administrators, and students know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE targets schools for deportation raids. She will fight to make sure our city does everything we can to protect our children and families. During her tenure as chair of the City Council’s Public Housing Committee, Alexa stood with NYCHA residents fighting to prevent more than 71,000 evictions of public housing residents. Safe, Affordable and Dignified Housing Since joining the New York City Council in 2022, Alexa has fought the wealthy developers and politicians who want to make this city a playground for the rich. Here’s how we’re building a city where every New Yorker can have an affordable, safe, and dignified home. What we’ve accomplished: Improved transparency for NYCHA management : More than 16,000 of the city’s public housing units are now managed by private companies. These privately managed NYCHA units are subject to less oversight than those under public"

Since her election in 2021, she has secured major investments for District 38 and working-class New Yorkers across the city — from restoring hundreds of millions in education funding, to securing multi-million dollar investments for neighborhood parks like Rainbow Playground and Martin Luther Park. She has also led the charge for major legislative victories for working-class Brooklyn — from protecting tenants after devastating fires, to taking on corporate polluters and fighting for clean air for our communities. And she’s fought against Mayor Adams’s reckless cuts to vital city services, demanding full funding for education, libraries, sanitation and parks. Ready for a New York City that works for the workers, not the ultra-wealthy? Read our 2025 platform and see how our movement is building a city that works for the many, not the few. Councilmember Alexa Avilés fights for education justice and public education. Quality & Equitable Education for All Alexa has spent her entire career fighting for education justice — from her time as PS 172’s PTA president, to her work as Parent Representative of the M.S. 88 School Leadership Team. She has continued to champion public education since taking office, and was one of few council members to vote against Eric Adams’s major cuts to the city’s education budget. Here’s how we’ll guarantee education for all New Yorkers. What we’ve accomplished: Fought Eric Adams’s disastrous cuts to the education budget: When Eric Adams attempted to gut funding for schools and educators, Alexa fought back against his cuts, restoring millions in cuts to public schools and childcare programs. Improved education spaces and playgrounds : Alexa has invested in schools and schoolyards across the district — such as the green Community Schoolyard at the P.S. 503 and P.S. 506 joint campus. The playground, built with green infrastructure, not only provides recreation space for students, it also will absorb ​​620,000 gallons of runoff annually, helping to reduce flooding in the neighborhood. Secured $4 million investment to develop a Latine Studies Curriculum Initiative: Alexa worked with community partners to secure funding for a Latine curriculum for NYC public schools. In a moment when MAGA lawmakers are banning books and erasing history from schools, Alexa fought to make sure the culturally-relevant education has a home in our city’s public schools. Invested in parks and green spaces: Alexa tackled District 38’s aging park infrastructure, and created more safe playground spaces for our district’s young people. She helped turn an underused concrete softball field into a popular state-of-the-art skate park in Red Hook’s Harold Ickes Playground. She secured $1.6 million to renovate Sunset Park’s Rainbow Playground, and is fighting for other park improvements in places like Pena Herrera Playground in Sunset Park. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term: Fight for universal childcare : Alexa will support the creation of a citywide Office of Childcare , tasked with creating free childcare for all NYC residents. She will fight for fully funding Pre-K and 3-K programs, rejecting cuts to early childcare and education. Fully fund education: While Trump and Musk want to dismantle public education, Alexa will champion fully investing in our schools and educators. She will reject cuts to our public education system and fight for more investments in multilingual learners, English-language learners, arts, and services for students with learning and physical disabilities. Stop ICE from entering our schools: While Eric Adams tries to undermine long-standing immigration laws in our city, Alexa will make sure teachers, administrators, and students know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE targets schools for deportation raids. She will fight to make sure our city does everything we can to protect our children and families. During her tenure as chair of the City Council’s Public Housing Committee, Alexa stood with NYCHA residents fighting to prevent more than 71,000 evictions of public housing residents. Safe, Affordable and Dignified Housing Since joining the New York City Council in 2022, Alexa has fought the wealthy developers and politicians who want to make this city a playground for the rich. Here’s how we’re building a city where every New Yorker can have an affordable, safe, and dignified home. What we’ve accomplished: Improved transparency for NYCHA management : More than 16,000 of the city’s public housing units are now managed by private companies. These privately managed NYCHA units are subject to less oversight than those under public"

Made sure renters don’t lose their homes after fires: After deadly fires destroyed apartments across NYC, Alexa fought for legislation that protects renters after devastating fires . The new law requires the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to work with the city’s Fire Department to make sure tenants know their rights when they are displaced by fires, and protect them from illegal evictions and delayed repairs. Funding affordable housing: Working with her colleagues in the Council’s Progressive Caucus, Alexa secured $2 billion for affordable housing capital funding, $140 million to rehabilitate rent-stabilized housing and expand affordable homeownership opportunities, $400 million in funding for housing vouchers, and $200 million for NYCHA upgrades and repairs. Stood with rent-stabilized tenants: Nearly one million apartments in NYC are rent-stabilized, providing protection to renters from massive rent increases from landlords.Yet in the midst of the city’s housing crisis, Mayor Eric Adams oversaw major rent hikes to rent-stabilized tenants, allowing his Rent Guidelines Board appointees to increase rent for 2.5 million New Yorkers. Alexa fought the mayor’s rent hikes and protested the big landlords who raised the rent. Her activism showed tenants how the Rent Guidelines Board works and put pressure on the mayor for raising rents in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis.

Alexa will support funding for more code enforcement and champion legislation to take homes back from the city’s worst landlords who put more New Yorkers at risk of losing their homes.

She will fight to restore the $25 million Mayor Adams cut from the office and make sure tenants have legal support when dealing with landlords who refuse to make basic repairs. Fund NYCHA and public housing repairs: District 38 contains two of the largest public housing complexes in Brooklyn — Red Hook East & Red Hook West. Public housing plays a vital role in keeping New York City affordable for working residents. As former chair of the public housing committee in City Council, Alexa won significant investments to cover rental arrears for NYCHA residents left out during COVID, added hundreds of millions for repairs, and restored cuts from Mayor Adams to the Vacant Unit Readiness program, which prepares and rehabilitates NYCHA units for new tenants.

Stop Eric Adams from evicting families from shelters: In the midst of the city’s homelessness crisis, Eric Adams pushed to kick asylum seekers and their families out of the city’s shelter system. Alexa will continue to fight against this policy, which will increase street homelessness and cost the city billions in lost wages. In her next term, Alexa will advance legislation that rescinds this cruel policy from the Mayor. Fight Trump and Musk’s chaotic agenda: From ending birthright citizenship to ending Temporary Protection Status for Haitians and other immigrant New York residents, Trump and Musk’s cruel immigration policies make New York City less safe and more unstable. In her next term, Alexa will support local legislation to defend our city from the billionaires’ chaos — from pushing local laws and resolutions defending our neighbors, to supporting the city’s lawsuits against the Trump administration, to joining immigration advocates to resist deportations and cuts to vital services that benefit all New Yorkers. Alexa fights for public safety — from investing in our communities to passing common-sense legislation to prevent discrimination and racial profiling. Building Safe Communities We can reduce crime by reducing the conditions that lead to crime like poverty and underemployment. Police and jails now do the work of social workers, educators, and health care providers. We can change that by investing in programs that stabilize and support New Yorkers and connect them with stable housing, meaningful employment, and social services. These are more effective interventions to prevent violence"

Fought to save and protect vital services for older adults from budget cuts : Alexa stood firm against proposals from Eric Adams to cut funding to the city’s Department for the Aging, including cuts to nutrition, housing, and service programs for older New Yorkers. Fighting for older immigrants: As chair of the Council’s immigration committee, Alexa organized public oversight hearings on the needs of senior immigrants, from improving access to social benefits for undocumented immigrants, to addressing obstacles due to language and cultural disparities. What we’ll keep fighting for in our next term : Fight for expanding vital senior housing programs : Alexa will push for legislation to make it easier for older adults to apply for affordable housing programs, and expand outreach to eligible seniors to prevent older New Yorkers from being priced out of their housing.

Protect seniors from discrimination : As the Trump administration ramps up its cruel, discriminatory agenda, Alexa will fight for the rights of aging New Yorkers, including the rights of older LGBTQ+ residents as they access senior housing and other services. Alexa’s Platform Councilmember Alexa Avilés fights to keep Brooklyn affordable for working New Yorkers. Since her election in 2021, she has secured major investments for District 38 and working-class New Yorkers across the city — from restoring hundreds of millions in education funding, to securing multi-million dollar investments for neighborhood parks like Rainbow Playground and Martin Luther Park. She has also led the charge for major legislative victories for working-class Brooklyn — from protecting tenants after devastating fires, to taking on corporate polluters and fighting for clean air for our communities. And she’s fought against Mayor Adams’s reckless cuts to vital city services, demanding full funding for education, libraries, sanitation and parks.

Councilmember Alexa Avilés fights for education justice and public education. Quality & Equitable Education for All Alexa has spent her entire career fighting for education justice — from her time as PS 172’s PTA president, to her work as Parent Representative of the M.S. 88 School Leadership Team. She has continued to champion public education since taking office, and was one of few council members to vote against Eric Adams’s major cuts to the city’s education budget. Here’s how we’ll guarantee education for all New Yorkers. What we’ve accomplished: Fought Eric Adams’s disastrous cuts to the education budget: When Eric Adams attempted to gut funding for schools and educators, Alexa fought back against his cuts, restoring millions in cuts to public schools and childcare programs.
