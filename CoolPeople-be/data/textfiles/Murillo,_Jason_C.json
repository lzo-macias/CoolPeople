Jason, looking forward to learning from your journey. You’ve got an amazing story and before we dive into that, let’s start with an important building block. Where do you get your work ethic from? My work ethic is deeply influenced by my upbringing and personal experiences. Growing up with limited financial resources, being homeless after leaving home at a young age with my mother, escaping from my abusive father who almost killed both of us, living in the streets, shelter & foster care system, and then public housing, I developed a strong drive to work hard, motivated by a fear of poverty in adulthood. This fear led me to engage in numerous activities, often leaving home early in the morning and returning late at night, which sometimes affected my personal relationships and time with my family. Over time, I realized that while hard work is essential, it’s equally important to appreciate the small joys in life, such as spending time with loved ones, giving back to my community, and indulging in simple pleasures such as going to a Yankees game, watch a movie, Sunday dinner with family, spending time with friends. This balance has become a cornerstone of my work ethic, emphasizing both dedication and the enjoyment of life’s moments. In my professional journey, I have distinguished myself in the entertainment industry. Acknowledging that while there may be more talented or popular individuals in my field, my unwavering work ethic sets me apart from the rest. This commitment to diligence and perseverance has been a key factor in all my success. Great, so let’s take a few minutes and cover your story. What should folks know about you and what you do? My name is Jason Murillo, a lifelong resident & native son of Manhattan’s East Village – Lower East Side, I’ am running for the New York City Council in District 2. Growing up in NYCHA public housing, I have firsthand experience with our community’s challenges that they face daily. Professionally, I’m a small business owner, entrepreneur, community organizer, advocate and activist. My campaign focuses on public safety, housing, fiscal responsibility, and community services. If our community is going to head to the polls and vote for whom should represent our community and district in the city council for the next 4 years, shouldn’t we vote for someone who truly represents us and is one of us? My campaign mission is simple to stand up for those who don’t have a voice or are often forgotten and to put our community and people first. I can’t win this race without you! Whether it’s flyering, spreading the word, volunteering, or donating, your support is crucial to achieving our shared vision for a better future. With strong leadership and a united community, we are stronger together. I’m not running for myself—I’m running for you, and I pledge to serve only the people once elected. Every day, I will fight for you—not for million-dollar developers, special interests, or lobbyists. I will work to bring back jobs for the unemployed, secure housing for homeless families, and put an end to the chaos of the migrant crisis and the reckless wasteful spending of your hard-earned tax dollars. I will safeguard NYCHA public housing to keep people in their homes and reinvest in our communities. I will fight to protect and invest in our district by securing more funding and tax breaks to keep our hospitals, libraries, schools, businesses, and community centers open year-round. With your help, support, and vote, we will make District 2—and all of NYC—stronger, safer, and better than ever! If you had to pick three qualities that are most important to develop, which three would you say matter most? To me, my top qualities are determination to never give up no matter what the odds are stacked against me to keep pushing forward no matter how many times I fail to get right back up, and to keep going. My work ethic is simply to outwork my opponents, wake up early, stay up all night, and get the job done. Luck will take you so far, but with hard work that will take you straight to the top.

In my professional journey, I have distinguished myself in the entertainment industry. Acknowledging that while there may be more talented or popular individuals in my field, my unwavering work ethic sets me apart from the rest. This commitment to diligence and perseverance has been a key factor in all my success. Great, so let’s take a few minutes and cover your story. What should folks know about you and what you do? My name is Jason Murillo, a lifelong resident & native son of Manhattan’s East Village – Lower East Side, I’ am running for the New York City Council in District 2. Growing up in NYCHA public housing, I have firsthand experience with our community’s challenges that they face daily. Professionally, I’m a small business owner, entrepreneur, community organizer, advocate and activist. My campaign focuses on public safety, housing, fiscal responsibility, and community services. If our community is going to head to the polls and vote for whom should represent our community and district in the city council for the next 4 years, shouldn’t we vote for someone who truly represents us and is one of us? My campaign mission is simple to stand up for those who don’t have a voice or are often forgotten and to put our community and people first. I can’t win this race without you! Whether it’s flyering, spreading the word, volunteering, or donating, your support is crucial to achieving our shared vision for a better future. With strong leadership and a united community, we are stronger together. I’m not running for myself—I’m running for you, and I pledge to serve only the people once elected. Every day, I will fight for you—not for million-dollar developers, special interests, or lobbyists. I will work to bring back jobs for the unemployed, secure housing for homeless families, and put an end to the chaos of the migrant crisis and the reckless wasteful spending of your hard-earned tax dollars. I will safeguard NYCHA public housing to keep people in their homes and reinvest in our communities. I will fight to protect and invest in our district by securing more funding and tax breaks to keep our hospitals, libraries, schools, businesses, and community centers open year-round. With your help, support, and vote, we will make District 2—and all of NYC—stronger, safer, and better than ever! If you had to pick three qualities that are most important to develop, which three would you say matter most? To me, my top qualities are determination to never give up no matter what the odds are stacked against me to keep pushing forward no matter how many times I fail to get right back up, and to keep going. My work ethic is simply to outwork my opponents, wake up early, stay up all night, and get the job done. Luck will take you so far, but with hard work that will take you straight to the top. Whether as a private citizen"

You’ve got an amazing story and before we dive into that, let’s start with an important building block. Where do you get your work ethic from? My work ethic is deeply influenced by my upbringing and personal experiences. Growing up with limited financial resources, being homeless after leaving home at a young age with my mother, escaping from my abusive father who almost killed both of us, living in the streets, shelter & foster care system, and then public housing, I developed a strong drive to work hard, motivated by a fear of poverty in adulthood. This fear led me to engage in numerous activities, often leaving home early in the morning and returning late at night, which sometimes affected my personal relationships and time with my family. Over time, I realized that while hard work is essential, it’s equally important to appreciate the small joys in life, such as spending time with loved ones, giving back to my community, and indulging in simple pleasures such as going to a Yankees game, watch a movie, Sunday dinner with family, spending time with friends.

Over time, I realized that while hard work is essential, it’s equally important to appreciate the small joys in life, such as spending time with loved ones, giving back to my community, and indulging in simple pleasures such as going to a Yankees game, watch a movie, Sunday dinner with family, spending time with friends. This balance has become a cornerstone of my work ethic, emphasizing both dedication and the enjoyment of life’s moments. In my professional journey, I have distinguished myself in the entertainment industry. Acknowledging that while there may be more talented or popular individuals in my field, my unwavering work ethic sets me apart from the rest. This commitment to diligence and perseverance has been a key factor in all my success. Great, so let’s take a few minutes and cover your story. What should folks know about you and what you do? My name is Jason Murillo, a lifelong resident & native son of Manhattan’s East Village – Lower East Side, I’ am running for the New York"

Professionally, I’m a small business owner, entrepreneur, community organizer, advocate and activist. My campaign focuses on public safety, housing, fiscal responsibility, and community services. If our community is going to head to the polls and vote for whom should represent our community and district in the city council for the next 4 years, shouldn’t we vote for someone who truly represents us and is one of us? My campaign mission is simple to stand up for those who don’t have a voice or are often forgotten and to put our community and people first. I can’t win this race without you! Whether it’s flyering, spreading the word, volunteering, or donating, your support is crucial to achieving our shared vision for a better future. With strong leadership and a united community, we are stronger together. I’m not running for myself—I’m running for you, and I pledge to serve only the people once elected. Every day, I will fight for you—not for million-dollar developers, special interests, or lobbyists. I will work to bring back jobs for the unemployed, secure housing for homeless families, and put an end to the chaos of the migrant crisis and the reckless wasteful spending of your hard-earned tax dollars. I will safeguard NYCHA public housing to keep people in their homes and reinvest in our communities. I will fight to protect and invest in our district by securing more funding and tax breaks to keep our hospitals, libraries, schools, businesses, and community centers open year-round. With your help, support, and vote, we will make District 2—and all of NYC—stronger, safer, and better than ever! If you had to pick three qualities that are most important to develop, which three would you say matter most? To me, my top qualities are determination to never give up no matter what the odds are stacked against me to keep pushing forward no matter how many times I fail to get right back up, and to keep going. My work ethic is simply to outwork my opponents, wake up early, stay up all night, and get the job done. Luck will take you so far, but with hard work that will take you straight to the top. Whether as a private citizen or now as a political figure and candidate, I have been advocating for people’s rights, from those living in public housing to elderly care & health services, successfully fighting for families with disabilities, keeping hospitals, community & media centers open, providing services, support & donations year-round to families throughout our communities and city. We need real change & leadership someone who will lead with compassion, empathy & common sense something that’s definitely lacking and missing in NY Politics. That’s why I’m running for public office to bring the change we all need, not with talk, and empty promises but with action. Looking back over the past 12 months or so, what do you think has been your biggest area of improvement or growth? My biggest area of growth in the last 12 months has been by far my community outreach, making connections, reaching out talking, and listening to hundreds of people throughout my district and around the city from struggling single mothers working 2 jobs trying to provide for their kids and afford the rent to a small business owner who owns a local deli store struggling to stay in business with rising rents, shoplifting, taxes and the cost of doing business in New York City, to parents fed up with rising gun violence, defunded schools & rampant crime on a daily basis, to seniors worrying will they be able to stay in their apartments. You get to know them on a personal level, know their names, and feel their pain, see their tears. It’s heartbreaking to see what they go through just to get from one day to the next because of failed elected officials who have let this city go to hell and many people leaving New York altogether. These personal experiences among others have led me to the point of running for public office because my community needs someone to be their fighter, a hero they can believe in to restore this great city to its former glory and bring common sense, public safety, protecting families, small businesses, and community first policies back to City Hall.

Photo Emily Swanson Conservative Party candidates running for city offices next year met in the Bronx on Dec. 14 to bolster their small but growing presence in the borough. The Viable Candidate Event, held at a Morrisania neighborhood church, was billed by the party as the city’s largest gathering of conservative leaders in 2024. The Bronx Conservative Party — which is distinct from the Republican Party — has seen a recent rise in its registered membership to around 3,000, in keeping with the borough’s increased support for President-elect Donald Trump, who earned nearly 30% of Bronxites’ votes in November. Statewide, the party has just over 154,000 members. With momentum on conservatives’ side, the Bronx played host to several candidates with unexpected roads into politics, including some who thought they hated politics and some who used to be Democrats. Several had previously run unsuccessfully on the conservative line, even as recently as November, but now see the opportunity to capitalize on the “Trump bump” in the reliably blue state of New York.

Email Sign Up The candidates speak The event was organized by Bronx Conservative Party vice chair and mayoral candidate Gonzalo Duran and featured speeches by over a dozen candidates for city council, public advocate and district leaders from various parts of the city. Duran acknowledged that Conservative Party candidates have a tough hill to climb in order to win in New York. “We won as a team with Trump winning, but individually, we lost,” he said. The pillars of Duran’s own mayoral platform are “leadership, transparency, anti-flipflopping and anti-corruption,” he said. He called for the recruitment of more party members, leading to more contributions and volunteers, with the goal of putting up candidates for every major office in the city. Thus far, the party’s effort has paid off, and it’s had to book larger and larger rooms for events, he said. “Now we’re getting our chops in there.” Gonzalo Duran is running for mayor as a Conservative Party member and organized the event.

Photo Emily Swanson Conservative Party candidates running for city offices next year met in the Bronx on Dec. 14 to bolster their small but growing presence in the borough. The Viable Candidate Event, held at a Morrisania neighborhood church, was billed by the party as the city’s largest gathering of conservative leaders in 2024. The Bronx Conservative Party — which is distinct from the Republican Party — has seen a recent rise in its registered membership to around 3,000, in keeping with the borough’s increased support for President-elect Donald Trump, who earned nearly 30% of Bronxites’ votes in November. Statewide, the party has just over 154,000 members. With momentum on conservatives’ side, the Bronx played host to several candidates with unexpected roads into politics, including some who thought they hated politics and some who used to be Democrats.

Denise Smith, who said she is running for Bronx City Council District 11, said she loved the diversity represented among the candidates and guests. She said she has lived in Norwood for 30 years and is new to the Conservative Party. Smith said that youth in particular are suffering a “great desperation” for more activities and events, and that they should have more opportunities to learn basic skills and career options. She also said public safety and education are in need of an “S.O.S.” “People are fed up with a system that doesn’t work,” Smith said. Emmanuel Findlay, who announced his candidacy for a Bronx seat on the City Council, pointed to infrastructure problems in the borough and apparent inequities in addressing longstanding issues. While he did not mention specific incidents, the partial building collapse last December at 1915 Billingsley Terrace stands out as an example of failure to maintain Bronx infrastructure. “If these buildings were anywhere but in the Bronx, they would not be treated this way,” he said. Findlay added that the city gave too many of its resources to undocumented migrants. “We need to take care of our own people first.” ‘Is he really Black?’ Throughout the event, most speakers stuck to common conservative themes of parental control and increased public safety. While the meeting largely struck a unifying tone, public advocate candidate Angela Aquino from Manhattan took a different approach. She said the incumbent, Jumaane Williams, was out of touch with New Yorkers and questioned his race, asking, “Is he really Black?” She explained that in her view Williams has not received real punishment for his multiple civil disobedience arrests, arguing that most Black people would have faced much harsher penalties. “The most that happened to him was suffer[ing] a stop and frisk. And he cried like a big baby when we know that the real Black person really gets arrested and gets convicted. That’s Black.” The Bronx Times reached out to Williams’ office and is awaiting response. Throughout the rest of the event, several speakers emphasized the need to put up conservative candidates for city races, even if they have slim chances of winning. Grace Marrero, who said she “may be running” for Bronx Borough President, expressed frustration at the lack of options for voters. “These incumbents won without even campaigning,” she said. If she does run for Borough President, Marrero said her candidacy would at least “put a bee in someone’s bonnet.” After the speeches, Duran told the Bronx Times he was pleased at the number and variety of candidates and grateful for those who voiced support for his mayoral bid. Their endorsements “show me that I do have a chance” at winning, said Duran. He said the event, which included a Republican party member and a moderate Democrat, was designed to be open to all. “I’m very bipartisan,” said Duran.

Findlay added that the city gave too many of its resources to undocumented migrants. “We need to take care of our own people first.” ‘Is he really Black?’ Throughout the event, most speakers stuck to common conservative themes of parental control and increased public safety. While the meeting largely struck a unifying tone, public advocate candidate Angela Aquino from Manhattan took a different approach. She said the incumbent, Jumaane Williams, was out of touch with New Yorkers and questioned his race, asking, “Is he really Black?” She explained that in her view Williams has not received real punishment for his multiple civil disobedience arrests, arguing that most Black people would have faced much harsher penalties. “The most that happened to him was suffer[ing] a stop and frisk. And he cried like a big baby when we know that the real Black person really gets arrested and gets convicted. That’s Black.” The Bronx Times reached out to Williams’ office and is awaiting response. Throughout the rest of the event, several speakers emphasized the need to put up conservative candidates for city races, even if they have slim chances of winning. Grace Marrero, who said she “may be running” for Bronx Borough President, expressed frustration at the lack of options for voters. “These incumbents won without even campaigning,” she said. If she does run for Borough President, Marrero said her candidacy would at least “put a bee in someone’s bonnet.” After the speeches, Duran told the Bronx Times he was pleased at the number and variety of candidates and grateful for those who voiced support for his mayoral bid. Their endorsements “show me that I do have a chance” at winning, said Duran. He said the event, which included a Republican party member and a moderate Democrat, was designed to be open to all. “I’m very bipartisan,” said Duran.

The Viable Candidate Event, held at a Morrisania neighborhood church, was billed by the party as the city’s largest gathering of conservative leaders in 2024. The Bronx Conservative Party — which is distinct from the Republican Party — has seen a recent rise in its registered membership to around 3,000, in keeping with the borough’s increased support for President-elect Donald Trump, who earned nearly 30% of Bronxites’ votes in November. Statewide, the party has just over 154,000 members.

Statewide, the party has just over 154,000 members. With momentum on conservatives’ side, the Bronx played host to several candidates with unexpected roads into politics, including some who thought they hated politics and some who used to be Democrats. Several had previously run unsuccessfully on the conservative line, even as recently as November, but now see the opportunity to capitalize on the “Trump bump” in the reliably blue state of New York.

Close Get the Full Story Sign Up The candidates speak The event was organized by Bronx Conservative Party vice chair and mayoral candidate Gonzalo Duran and featured speeches by over a dozen candidates for city council, public advocate and district leaders from various parts of the city. Duran acknowledged that Conservative Party candidates have a tough hill to climb in order to win in New York. “We won as a team with Trump winning, but individually, we lost,” he said. The pillars of Duran’s own mayoral platform are “leadership, transparency, anti-flipflopping and anti-corruption,” he said. He called for the recruitment of more party members, leading to more contributions and volunteers, with the goal of putting up candidates for every major office in the city. Thus far, the party’s effort has paid off, and it’s had to book larger and larger rooms for events, he said. “Now we’re getting our chops in there.” Gonzalo Duran is running for mayor as a Conservative Party member and organized the event.

Denise Smith, who said she is running for Bronx City Council District 11, said she loved the diversity represented among the candidates and guests. She said she has lived in Norwood for 30 years and is new to the Conservative Party. Smith said that youth in particular are suffering a “great desperation” for more activities and events, and that they should have more opportunities to learn basic skills and career options. She also said public safety and education are in need of an “S.O.S.” “People are fed up with a system that doesn’t work,” Smith said. Emmanuel Findlay, who announced his candidacy for a Bronx seat on the City Council, pointed to infrastructure problems in the borough and apparent inequities in addressing longstanding issues. While he did not mention specific incidents, the partial building collapse last December at 1915 Billingsley Terrace stands out as an example of failure to maintain Bronx infrastructure. “If these buildings were anywhere but in the Bronx, they would not be treated this way,” he said. Findlay added that the city gave too many of its resources to undocumented migrants. “We need to take care of our own people first.” ‘Is he really Black?’ Throughout the event, most speakers stuck to common conservative themes of parental control and increased public safety. While the meeting largely struck a unifying tone, public advocate candidate Angela Aquino from Manhattan took a different approach. She said the incumbent, Jumaane Williams, was out of touch with New Yorkers and questioned his race, asking, “Is he really Black?” She explained that in her view Williams has not received real punishment for his multiple civil disobedience arrests, arguing that most Black people would have faced much harsher penalties. “The most that happened to him was suffer[ing] a stop and frisk. And he cried like a big baby when we know that the real Black person really gets arrested and gets convicted. That’s Black.” The Bronx Times reached out to Williams’ office and is awaiting response. Throughout the rest of the event, several speakers emphasized the need to put up conservative candidates for city races, even if they have slim chances of winning. Grace Marrero, who said she “may be running” for Bronx Borough President, expressed frustration at the lack of options for voters. “These incumbents won without even campaigning,” she said. If she does run for Borough President, Marrero said her candidacy would at least “put a bee in someone’s bonnet.” After the speeches, Duran told the Bronx Times he was pleased at the number and variety of candidates and grateful for those who voiced support for his mayoral bid. Their endorsements “show me that I do have a chance” at winning, said Duran. He said the event, which included a Republican party member and a moderate Democrat, was designed to be open to all. “I’m very bipartisan,” said Duran.

Smith said that youth in particular are suffering a “great desperation” for more activities and events, and that they should have more opportunities to learn basic skills and career options.

Emmanuel Findlay, who announced his candidacy for a Bronx seat on the City Council, pointed to infrastructure problems in the borough and apparent inequities in addressing longstanding issues. While he did not mention specific incidents, the partial building collapse last December at 1915 Billingsley Terrace stands out as an example of failure to maintain Bronx infrastructure. “If these buildings were anywhere but in the Bronx, they would not be treated this way,” he said. Findlay added that the city gave too many of its resources to undocumented migrants. “We need to take care of our own people first.” ‘Is he really Black?’ Throughout the event, most speakers stuck to common conservative themes of parental control and increased public safety. While the meeting largely struck a unifying tone, public advocate candidate Angela Aquino from Manhattan took a different approach. She said the incumbent, Jumaane Williams, was out of touch with New Yorkers and questioned his race, asking, “Is he really Black?” She explained that in her view Williams has not received real punishment for his multiple civil disobedience arrests, arguing that most Black people would have faced much harsher penalties. “The most that happened to him was suffer[ing] a stop and frisk. And he cried like a big baby when we know that the real Black person really gets arrested and gets convicted. That’s Black.” The Bronx Times reached out to Williams’ office and is awaiting response.

If she does run for Borough President, Marrero said her candidacy would at least “put a bee in someone’s bonnet.” After the speeches, Duran told the Bronx Times he was pleased at the number and variety of candidates and grateful for those who voiced support for his mayoral bid.

While the meeting largely struck a unifying tone, public advocate candidate Angela Aquino from Manhattan took a different approach. She said the incumbent, Jumaane Williams, was out of touch with New Yorkers and questioned his race, asking, “Is he really Black?” She explained that in her view Williams has not received real punishment for his multiple civil disobedience arrests, arguing that most Black people would have faced much harsher penalties. “The most that happened to him was suffer[ing] a stop and frisk. And he cried like a big baby when we know that the real Black person really gets arrested and gets convicted. That’s Black.” The Bronx Times reached out to Williams’ office and is awaiting response.
