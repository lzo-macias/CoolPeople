Prosecutors proved at trial that Micro Targeting never provided any campaign services, and that the money was instead redirected to a non-profit corporation called NY 4 Life, which Wills controlled. Wills withdrew the money and made a series of personal purchases, including at Macy's, where he used a portion of the funds to purchase a $750 Louis Vuitton handbag. Prosecutors also detailed how Wills used $21,000 in State grant funds for personal and political expenses. The $21,000 was part of a $33,000 grant provided to NY 4 Life from the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS), earmarked by former State Senator Shirley Huntley while Wills was serving as Huntley's chief of staff. The grant stipulated that the money had to be used to conduct four public service projects. Yet witnesses at trial testified that NY 4 Life only held one event, while Wills used approximately $21,000 of the funds for personal and political expenses, including at Nordstrom and Home Depot. Wills also used a portion of the money to pay individuals who had carried out campaign work for his City Council race.

Former Queens Council Member Ruben Wills said he suffered \"extreme anxiety attacks\" after watching shocking bodycam video of multiple New York state correction officers mercilessly beating a defenseless inmate before his death in December. \"It was not just the brutality of this man being beaten,\" Wills told NBC New York in an exclusive interview, \"It was because I remembered some of those officers.\" Wills says some of the officers caught on bodycam assaulting Robert Brooks, 43, are the same officers who tormented and psychologically tortured him when he was incarcerated at the same Upstate Marcy Correctional Facility in 2017-2018. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE The former councilmember — who represented southeast Queens until his conviction — says he spent about eight months incarcerated at Marcy. At the time, he was serving a 2- to 6-year sentence for misusing roughly $30,000 in public and campaign money. Eventually, Wills' conviction was reversed on appeal and dismissed by a judge, but not before having had some brutal experiences behind bars, he says. Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP \"There was one group that took particular joy in hurting people,\" Wills said, describing what he says were daily beatings by a particular group of officers. Wills said the group was known as the \"hands-on-crew\" because they put their hands on prisoners. The group operated like a gang, he recalled, ruling with racist insults, fear of retribution, and even death threats. News Catholic Church 15 hours ago Live updates: American Cardinal Robert Prevost elected as new pope, takes name Leo XIV Catholic Church 4 hours ago What to know about Robert Prevost, the first pope born in the U.S. and his ties to Peru \"I would never be found,\" Wills said, describing what the officers told him when he questioned their conduct. \"They would just put me in the back of the prison in the ground and my family wouldn't know for months that I was gone.\" Wills said two officers also taunted him to kill himself after he was put in a punitive, solitary cell called the SHU. They told him the solitary confinement was suicide watch, he told News 4, even though he had insisted he was not suicidal. According to Wills, \"They said this is where they take everybody for punishment. I said suicide watch isn't punishment!\" During a recent sit-down interview with NBC New York at the Rochdale Community Center, Wills became emotional while describing the abuse he says he endured from the two correction officers outside that solitary cell. \"They were coming and kicking the door, slamming against the door all night long, telling me to kill myself, singing \"Suicide,\" Wills said, describing a song by musical artist Sean Kingston. Wills says the officers held a hangman-style sketch of him up against the cell door while calling out \"Is he dead yet? He's not dead yet!\" After Wills was released, he worked with an animation producer to create a series of video re-enactments he says represent his version of encounters with correction officers. He said one reason he created the re-enactments was to help people envision his version of how he ended up in a wheelchair for eight months. Wills said it happened on day one of his prison sentence on Rikers Island. He says that because of a pre-existing medical condition, he was supposed to be placed in the Rikers NICU, but that instead, correction officers took him on a violent van ride during which he was thrown around in a metal compartment of the van. When the van ride stopped, he was unconscious, Wills said. Citing medical neglect at Rikers, in 2018, Wills sued the city for $10 million, a fact that has been previously reported. Now, six years later, Wills says the city is \"stonewalling\" — withholding medical records he needs for his case. Wills suggested Mayor Eric Adams could have helped. \"I mean, this is not a shot at him, but we"

    "text": "Ruben Wills alleges \"psychological torture\" at the hands of some correction officers from the Upstate Marcy Correctional Facility By Melissa Russo • Published January 24, 2025 • Updated on January 24, 2025 at 11:22 am • Published January 24, 2025 • Updated on January 24, 2025 at 11:22 am • January 24, 2025 11:22 am Former Queens Council Member Ruben Wills said he suffered \"extreme anxiety attacks\" after watching shocking bodycam video of multiple New York state correction officers mercilessly beating a defenseless inmate before his death in December. \"It was not just the brutality of this man being beaten,\" Wills told NBC New York in an exclusive interview, \"It was because I remembered some of those officers.\" Wills says some of the officers caught on bodycam assaulting Robert Brooks, 43, are the same officers who tormented and psychologically tortured him when he was incarcerated at the same Upstate Marcy Correctional Facility in 2017-2018. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are The former councilmember — who represented southeast Queens until his conviction — says he spent about eight months incarcerated at Marcy. At the time, he was serving a 2- to 6-year sentence for misusing roughly $30,000 in public and campaign money. Eventually, Wills' conviction was reversed on appeal and dismissed by a judge, but not before having had some brutal experiences behind bars, he says. Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. \"There was one group that took particular joy in hurting people,\" Wills said, describing what he says were daily beatings by a particular group of officers. Wills said the group was known as the \"hands-on-crew\" because they put their hands on prisoners. The group operated like a gang, he recalled, ruling with racist insults, fear of retribution, and even death threats. News 15 hours ago Live updates: American Cardinal Robert Prevost elected as new pope, takes name Leo XIV 4 hours ago What to know about Robert Prevost, the first pope born in the U.S. and his ties to Peru \"I would never be found,\" Wills said, describing what the officers told him when he questioned their conduct. \"They would just put me in the back of the prison in the ground and my family wouldn't know for months that I was gone.\" Wills said two officers also taunted him to kill himself after he was put in a punitive, solitary cell called the SHU. They told him the solitary confinement was suicide watch, he told News 4, even though he had insisted he was not suicidal. According to Wills, \"They said this is where they take everybody for punishment. I said suicide watch isn't punishment!\" During a recent sit-down interview with NBC New York at the Rochdale Community Center, Wills became emotional while describing the abuse he says he endured from the two correction officers outside that solitary cell. \"They were coming and kicking the door, slamming against the door all night long, telling me to kill myself, singing \"Suicide,\" Wills said, describing a song by musical artist Sean Kingston. Wills says the officers held a hangman-style sketch of him up against the cell door while calling out \"Is he dead yet? He's not dead yet!\" After Wills was released, he worked with an animation producer to create a series of video re-enactments he says represent his version of encounters with correction officers. He said one reason he created the re-enactments was to help people envision his version of how he ended up in a wheelchair for eight months. Wills said it happened on day one of his prison sentence on Rikers Island. He says that because of a pre-existing medical condition, he was supposed to be placed in the Rikers NICU, but that instead, correction officers took him on a violent van ride during which he was thrown around in a metal compartment of the van. When the van ride stopped, he was unconscious, Wills said. Citing medical neglect at Rikers, in 2018, Wills sued the city for $10 million, a fact that has been previously reported. Now, six years later, Wills says the city is \"stonewalling\" — withholding medical records he needs for his case. Wills suggested Mayor Eric Adams could have helped. \"I mean, this is not a shot at him, but we have a mayor who went through police brutality when he was younger. So you would think that he would direct his Corporation Counsel to clear this backlog up,\" said Wills. The NYC"
