    "text": "NATION Hate Crime Add Topic Man charged with hate crimes after series of NYC street attacks Thao Nguyen USA TODAY A man who was arrested in March following a series of random attacks across New York City in the past year has been indicted on hate crime charges in connection to several incidents, prosecutors announced Tuesday. Skiboky Stora, 40, of Brooklyn, New York, was charged with assaulting, stalking, and harassing strangers in a string of \"anti-female, anti-white, and antisemitic incidents\" that occurred between last September and March of this year, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Stora faces three counts of third-degree assault as a hate crime, one count each of third-degree stalking as a hate crime, and second-degree aggravated harassment. \"Skiboky Stora allegedly committed a series of hate-motivated incidents against several individuals based on their perceived gender, race, and religion,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. \"Much of what defines our city is respect and acceptance of all people. Nobody should have to fear for their safety because of their identity.\" Stora was initially arrested on an assault charge in connection to an attack on at least one woman as she walked the streets of Manhattan, a New York Police Department spokesperson previously told USA TODAY. A 23-year-old woman had reported to police that she was walking in the Chelsea neighborhood on the morning of March 25 when an unknown individual struck her in the head. The victim fell to the ground and suffered pain and swelling on the left side of her head, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The victim shared her story on TikTok and Stora was arrested two days after the incident following a joint investigation by the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force and the district attorney’s office. The incident came amid unprovoked attacks that were reported by nearly a half-dozen women across New York City in which they said an unidentified person punched them in the head or face. Police previously confirmed to USA TODAY that they were investigating a similar attack on St. Patrick's Day that involved a 25-year-old woman. Suspect accused of hate crimes in four incidents In addition to the attack on March 25, prosecutors accused Stora of committing hate crimes in three other incidents in 2023. On Sept. 20, 2023, Stora is accused of elbowing a 17-year-old student in the neck and using a curse word, saying: \"You people think you can do whatever ... you want,\" according to court documents. The incident also occurred in Chelsea. Then on Oct. 26, Stora elbowed a 37-year-old woman in the left shoulder, which caused pain and bruising, court documents added. The woman was walking past Stora in Chelsea when the incident happened. And on Nov. 18, a Jewish couple — identified as a 28-year-old woman and her 28-year-old husband — were walking their dogs in Union Square when they saw Stora tearing down posters of Israeli hostages and stopped to take a photo of him, according to court documents. After Stora noticed the couple looking at him, he began to follow them and shout anti-white and antisemitic remarks. Prosecutors said a Good Samaritan invited the couple inside an apartment building to get away from Stora. He then followed them inside the building's lobby and yelled: \"Die, Jews, Die!\" at them, according to court documents. Developing into the evening: For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing. Stora was arraigned Tuesday and has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has claimed that authorities had \"no probable cause\" to arrest him, according to WNYW . \"They’re (trying to) indict me man ... this guy Alvin Bragg he’s corrupted,\" Stora said outside the courtroom on Tuesday, the TV station reported.

Bragg, Jr. Skiboky Stora, 40, of Brooklyn, has been charged with three counts of third-degree assault as a hate crime, one count of stalking as a hate crime and second-degree aggravated harassment for incidents between September of 2023 and March 2024. \"Skiboky Stora allegedly committed a series of hate-motivated incidents against several individuals based on their perceived gender, race and religion,\" said District Attorney Bragg. \"Much of what defines our city is respect and acceptance of all people. Nobody should have to fear for their safety because of their identity. I thank our prosecutors for their unwavering commitment in seeking justice for these victims.\" The charges come after 7 TikTok users reported being punched in New York in a matter of two weeks , according to police, though they said there was no evidence the incidents were related. One of the TikTokers is among the victims mentioned in Stora's list of charges.

The woman reported taking a picture of him and Stora allegedly then began to follow them and shout anti-white and antisemitic remarks, including, \"F--- you, white boy.\" A passerby led the couple inside their apartment building so they could get away from Stora, but he allegedly followed them into the building lobby, yelling antisemitic slurs in substance, according to Bragg. On March 25, 2024, a 23-year-old white woman passed Stora on the street and he allegedly struck her in the head which caused her to fall to the ground, officials say. She is reported to have suffered pain and swelling on the left side of her head. Stora was arrested shortly after an investigation by the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. ABC News' Aaron Katersky contributed to this report.
