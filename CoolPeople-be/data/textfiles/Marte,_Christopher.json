His parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic. His dad ran a bodega, while his mom worked in a garment sweatshop before becoming a home attendant. Christopher attended PS 20 and University Settlement’s afterschool programs, before studying abroad for college in China, Costa Rica, and England. Eventually, his dad’s store had to close because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. So he decided to take action. He quit his job in finance and dove deeper into working in his neighborhood. It was through founding community gardens in NYCHA, coaching MS 131’s basketball teams, and volunteering that he learned that many of the issues we face come from the same source: elected officials who line their pockets with real estate money and prioritize political gain over people. So, he decided to run for City Council in 2017. Though he fell short by 200 votes, Christopher’s campaign united people across the district. He brought together neighbors who lived only a quarter-mile away from each other but had never had a reason to work together before. His campaign created a culture of unity because he ran on a platform of change. In 2021, his bid for City Council in an open field with nine other challengers was successful. He received more votes than the second and third-place competitors combined and earned support from every part of the diverse district. As a council member, Christopher has delivered for Lower Manhattan residents, from building 100% affordable housing to creating two new parks, planting over 500 new street trees, and passing legislation to expand housing subsidies for seniors and people with disabilities. He has also been leading the fight to end the 24-hour workday for home attendants and to protect municipal retirees' healthcare from being privatized. Christopher continues to have the trust of his constituents, and in 2023, he was re-elected in a landslide victory. In the City Council Representing City Council District 1, Christopher serves as the co-chair of the Manhattan Delegation. He sits on the Parks, Aging, Landmarks and Site Deposition, Resiliency and Waterfronts, Civil Rights, and Senior Centers and Food Insecurity Committees. He has introduced 16 bills and cosponsored 185 pieces of legislation and allocated millions of dollars to community initiatives. Ready to help?

Biography Christopher Marte was born and raised on the Lower East Side, where his father owned a bodega and his mother worked in a garment factory before becoming a home attendant. When he wasn’t stacking cans, he attended local public schools and after-school programs. Eventually, his father’s store had to close down because of rent hikes, and Christopher started to see the community he loved get torn apart by luxury development and corrupt politicians. Christopher co-founded two community gardens in NYCHA and volunteered at the Bowery Mission in order to give back to the community that raised him. Professionally, Christopher started his career managing IBM’s retirement funds while paying off his student loans. As he continued to work in finance, he served on the Young Professionals Board of Defy Ventures — where he guided formerly incarcerated people through the process of starting their own small businesses. Afterwards, Christopher worked as a legal researcher at an immigration law firm, before deciding to run for City Council in 2017. Although Christopher fell short by 200 votes, he was able to unite people all across District 1; neighbors, who lived only a quarter mile away from each other but never had a reason to work together before, became closer connected. After the election, he served as the New York State Director at Arena, using his experience running for office to train a new generation of candidates and campaign staffers. In 2021, Christopher won the City Council election and now serves as District 1’s City Council Member.
