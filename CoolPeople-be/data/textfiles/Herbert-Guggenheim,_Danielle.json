Here’s what I’ll deliver for District 11: TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING Rents in The Bronx are crushing working families and pushing the unemployed and working poor toward homelessness. In District 11, 27% of residents live in poverty—well above the city average. We need immediate action to unite and empower tenants, community boards, and city planners to work with nonprofits, developers, and landlords to create solutions prioritizing people over profit. ENHANCED EDUCATION Bronx schools are in dire need for more funding and necessary materials. This disparity contributes to an achievement gap that disproportionately affects students from low-income families. Our children are being denied their right to a quality education. The future of The Bronx depends on leveling the playing field—investing more in historically disenfranchised public schools and infrastructure investments to open new schools. Teachers should be supported to ensure that every child, regardless of their ZIP code, has an equal shot at success. QUALITY HEALTHCARE First and foremost supporting our retirees right to medical coverage by supporting Bill 1096. The bridges connecting our sick and vulnerable to life-saving healthcare have collapsed. This gap is a moral crisis that demands immediate action.
