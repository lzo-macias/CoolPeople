ABOUT ABOUT Aidan Rivera is a young Staten Island native from the North Shore. The son of a public school teacher and NYC peace officer, Aidan knows that New York City is abandoning working class families across the city, and especially on the North Shore. He's running because he loves Staten Island and every piece of our vibrant community, and refuses to allow his community to be forgotten.

He's running because he loves Staten Island and every piece of our vibrant community, and refuses to allow his community to be forgotten. Shot on his way home from high school in 2012, his family knew what it meant to feel unsafe. Like so many young people on the North Shore already know, the threat of violence is a real one when you're living in \"the forgotten borough\". He worked with local representatives City Councilmember Debi Rose on the Safe Zones Program and the Ceasefire Initiative to combat gun violence and curb violence overall. He also became a certified Peer Mediator, helping his fellow students resolve conflicts peacefully. This was when he learned how important community is and how effective it can be.

    "text": "Home Music Bio Contact AidanNation AidanNation AidanNation Home Music Bio Contact Bio Bio Multi-talented American Pop / RnB artist AidanNation has 1 of 2 goals with his music, “to tug on your heartstrings with raw / real lyrics or to make you dance your @$$ off!” Growing up dancing in hip hop studios, AidanNation was no stranger to the stage from a young age, but it wasn’t until his late teenage years that he discovered he had a voice and a strong ear for harmony which led him to explore his talents in singing and songwriting. AidanNation’s childhood home was filled with RnB and much of his early influences come from artists such as Justin Timberlake, Usher and legends such as Prince, George Michael, Earth Wind & Fire, and Donny Hathaway. But don’t get it twisted, AidanNation is much more than just your average singer / songwriter and is one you must see live. On stage, AidanNation is electric as he lights up the stage with his intricate and powerful dance choreography and backup dancers in addition to his killer vocals, pulling inspiration and passion from his Puerto Rican and African American roots. Aidan is a powerful lyricist, empathetic and passionate about the music he writes and his ability to intimately connect with his audience is profound. AidanNation’s current focus is on releasing more of his original material and has nearly 10 new singles slated for release in 2024 and early 2025 across the 3 genres AidanNation loves – RnB, EDM, and Pop. One thing to note: regardless of the genre, AidanNation insists on instilling soul and emotion into his thick harmony-filled vocal arrangements and lyrics.
