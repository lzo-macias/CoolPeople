Hanks Under Fire: Scandals, Challengers, and a NYC Council Seat in Peril Copy link Facebook Email Notes More Share Transcript By M. Thomas Nast and Frankie Pressman, with Richard Luthmann Kamillah Hanks. With the 2025 NYC Council elections on the horizon, Kamillah Hanks, who represents Staten Island's North Shore, faces a storm of opposition. Her political survival is in jeopardy as powerful New York City groups, law enforcement, and aspiring politicians gear up to challenge her in the upcoming NYC Council race. The District Leader race in the largely Democratic 61st Assembly District will play heavily as to who will represent Staten Island’s 49th District at City Hall. There are developments in that contest as well. NYC Mayor Eric Adams The backlash against Hanks has been brewing for months, fueled by her controversial support of policies in defiance of NYC Mayor Eric Adams, NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and other influential figures and groups, her association with questionable figures, and a growing disconnect with her constituents. Some say the tension reached a boiling point this past weekend at the inaugural NYC Soul Food Festival at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, where Hanks' absence sparked widespread criticism. “She doesn’t even show up for her own community,” said one attendee, echoing a sentiment shared by many. “We deserve a representative who is present, listens, and cares. Kamillah Hanks is not that person.” NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams The event, headlined by NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Commissioner for Cultural Affairs Laurie Cumbo, became a hotbed of discontent against Hanks. “People are tired of her,” said another festival-goer. “She’s not fighting for us. She’s fighting for herself and her cronies.” Comunity groups from Rosebank, Port Richmond, and Arlington are also expressing dissatisfaction with Hanks. Potential Challengers Eye 2025 Primary As Hanks’ popularity wanes, several political figures are positioning themselves to challenge her in the 2025 Democratic primary. Among them are Sarah Blas, a two-time candidate who has previously run for New York State Senate and U.S. Congress, and Selina Grey, a seasoned community organizer and political activist. Sarah Blas Blas, who lives in the New York City Housing Authority’s Richmond Terrace Houses, has a history of advocating for social justice. Despite her multiple previous electoral defeats, Blas remains undeterred and is considering another run for the NYC Council seat. “This district needs real change,” Blas has previously stated. “I’ve seen our community's struggles, and I’m ready to bring meaningful change to the North Shore.” Selina Grey Selina Grey, a well-known figure in Staten Island’s North Shore community, was also eyeballing Hanks’ seat. However, sources say that after meetings with party leadership, she has decided to forgo complicating a NYC Council primary race in favor of a different political battle. Grey is a community organizer with the New York State Nurses Association and a mentor to young women through the Staten Island NAACP. She is now setting her sights on the 2025 District Leader race for the 61st Assembly District. That district, within the lines for Hanks’ Council seat, will be determinative in next June’s Democratic Primary Race. Grey has a tough task facing incumbent Jasmine “Jasi” Robinson, the current Female Democratic District Leader. Robinson, a prominent activist and member of the Staten Island Democratic Socialists of America, has strong roots in the district. She has been a vocal advocate for progressive causes and has garnered support from various activist groups. Grey’s challenge to Robinson is expected to be closely watched because it will likely also determine the outcome of the Democratic NYC Council primary.

She does the work.” Powerful NYC Groups Line Up Against Hanks Hanks' troubles are not limited to potential challengers. Powerful groups within New York City's political landscape are actively working to replace her. The Staten Island Democratic Party, led by Chair Laura Sword, has already begun interviewing candidates to primary Hanks. Sword, who is reportedly not on speaking terms with Hanks, is said to be leaning towards backing a challenger who aligns more closely with the party's values. “Kamillah does not respect the wishes of the rank and file, and that was clear when she snubbed Debi Rose for the Board of Elections position,” a county committee member said. Staten Island Dems Leader Laura Sword Mayor Eric Adams and NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams have also distanced themselves from Hanks. Both leaders, frustrated with Hanks’ defiance and controversies, have made it clear that they want nothing to do with her. Their discontent with Hanks became evident after she championed the \"How Many Stops Act,\" a piece of legislation that City Hall opposed. In a decisive move, Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams stripped Hanks of her position as Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Public Safety, a significant demotion that weakened Hanks politically. She is now one of only two NYC Democrats without a committee chair, a clear sign of her diminishing influence within the Council. “The Mayor and the Speaker see Hanks as a liability,” said a Manhattan political consultant familiar with the situation. “They want someone who can work with them, not against them. They’re not just stepping away—they’re actively involved in finding her replacement.” According to sources, both Adamses have been sending potential candidates to meet with Laura Sword, indicating their commitment to ousting Hanks. Some are presently City Hall staffers. “They’re determined to find someone who can represent Staten Island’s North Shore without the baggage that Hanks carries,” the consultant added. Adding to Hanks’ woes, law enforcement unions, including the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), have turned their backs on her. The SBA, led by President Vincent Vallelong, publicly denounced Hanks for her support of the \"How Many Stops Act,\" a bill that mandates the NYPD to track investigative interactions with the public. SBA President Vincent Vallelong Vallelong did not mince words, stating, \"She sold herself as pro-law enforcement for endorsements, but her vote exposes a lack of truthfulness and transparency. As Public Safety Committee Chair, her support of this idiotic bill demonstrates ignorance of police work and disregard for public safety.\" Hanks' relationship with law enforcement further deteriorated after her demotion by Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams. The loss of support from these key figures and the police unions has made Hanks’ re-election campaign an uphill battle. \"Once you lose the police unions, they never come back,\" said a seasoned NYC political consultant. \"And it’s near impossible to carry a district on Staten Island if you’re perceived as anti-cop.\" Scandals and Controversies Hanks’ political career has been marred by multiple scandals that have only added fuel to the fire. One of the most contentious issues is her association with the True2Life Organization, led by Malcolm Penn and Mike Perry. The group has been criticized for its public support of the parole of Shatiek Johnson, who murdered NYPD Officer Gerard Carter in 1998 on Staten Island. True2Life Organization principal Mike Perry [L] and alleged Bloods street gang murderer John Pena [R]. The decision to award a subcontract to True2Life for programming at the Gerard Carter Community Center in Stapleton, named after the slain officer, has sparked outrage. Jozette Carter-Williams, the widow of Officer Carter, expressed her vehement opposition to the move. Last year, Councilmember Kamillah Hanks stood feet away from NYPD widow Jozette Carter-Williams and her son while they advocated against parole for cop killer Shatiek Johnson. Now, Hanks is pushing NYC contracts for cop killer sympathizers. “I support second chances. And I will support Shatiek Johnson's parole the day after my son has a chance to hug his father again,” Carter-Williams said. She added, \"I am incensed at the sentiments of the current councilmember and her selected associates, the True2Life Organization, which is anti-police and anti-NYPD and their families.\" Hanks has also faced backlash for allocating $105,000 in NYC Council funds to the Canvas Institute for Arts and Culture, a nonprofit led by Henry “Bobby Digi” Olisa, husband of NYC Cultural Affairs Commissioner Laurie Cumbo.

In a decisive move, Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams stripped Hanks of her position as Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Public Safety, a significant demotion that weakened Hanks politically. She is now one of only two NYC Democrats without a committee chair, a clear sign of her diminishing influence within the Council. “The Mayor and the Speaker see Hanks as a liability,” said a Manhattan political consultant familiar with the situation. “They want someone who can work with them, not against them. They’re not just stepping away—they’re actively involved in finding her replacement.” According to sources, both Adamses have been sending potential candidates to meet with Laura Sword, indicating their commitment to ousting Hanks. Some are presently City Hall staffers. “They’re determined to find someone who can represent Staten Island’s North Shore without the baggage that Hanks carries,” the consultant added. Adding to Hanks’ woes, law enforcement unions, including the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), have turned their backs on her. The SBA, led by President Vincent Vallelong, publicly denounced Hanks for her support of the \"How Many Stops Act,\" a bill that mandates the NYPD to track investigative interactions with the public. SBA President Vincent Vallelong Vallelong did not mince words, stating, \"She sold herself as pro-law enforcement for endorsements, but her vote exposes a lack of truthfulness and transparency. As Public Safety Committee Chair, her support of this idiotic bill demonstrates ignorance of police work and disregard for public safety.\" Hanks' relationship with law enforcement further deteriorated after her demotion by Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams. The loss of support from these key figures and the police unions has made Hanks’ re-election campaign an uphill battle. \"Once you lose the police unions, they never come back,\" said a seasoned NYC political consultant. \"And it’s near impossible to carry a district on Staten Island if you’re perceived as anti-cop.\" Scandals and Controversies Hanks’ political career has been marred by multiple scandals that have only added fuel to the fire. One of the most contentious issues is her association with the True2Life Organization, led by Malcolm Penn and Mike Perry. The group has been criticized for its public support of the parole of Shatiek Johnson, who murdered NYPD Officer Gerard Carter in 1998 on Staten Island. True2Life Organization principal Mike Perry [L] and alleged Bloods street gang murderer John Pena [R]. The decision to award a subcontract to True2Life for programming at the Gerard Carter Community Center in Stapleton, named after the slain officer, has sparked outrage. Jozette Carter-Williams, the widow of Officer Carter, expressed her vehement opposition to the move. Last year, Councilmember Kamillah Hanks stood feet away from NYPD widow Jozette Carter-Williams and her son while they advocated against parole for cop killer Shatiek Johnson. Now, Hanks is pushing NYC contracts for cop killer sympathizers. “I support second chances. And I will support Shatiek Johnson's parole the day after my son has a chance to hug his father again,” Carter-Williams said. She added, \"I am incensed at the sentiments of the current councilmember and her selected associates, the True2Life Organization, which is anti-police and anti-NYPD and their families.\" Hanks has also faced backlash for allocating $105,000 in NYC Council funds to the Canvas Institute for Arts and Culture, a nonprofit led by Henry “Bobby Digi” Olisa, husband of NYC Cultural Affairs Commissioner Laurie Cumbo.

She does the work.” Powerful NYC Groups Line Up Against Hanks Hanks' troubles are not limited to potential challengers. Powerful groups within New York City's political landscape are actively working to replace her. The Staten Island Democratic Party, led by Chair Laura Sword, has already begun interviewing candidates to primary Hanks. Sword, who is reportedly not on speaking terms with Hanks, is said to be leaning towards backing a challenger who aligns more closely with the party's values. “Kamillah does not respect the wishes of the rank and file, and that was clear when she snubbed Debi Rose for the Board of Elections position,” a county committee member said.

His involvement in Hanks’ political career has drawn considerable scrutiny, particularly in light of his legal troubles.

Luthmann, a contributor to this outlet, provided background and comments on this article. He spent four years in federal prison on charges he claims were politically motivated lawfare. Now, his probation has ended, and he wants his money. “Dopey Kevin didn’t like collections calls from my lawyers. So he called the FBI and the DOJ and said I was ‘witness tampering’ to avoid paying me.

Thomas Nast and Frankie Pressman, with Richard Luthmann By M. Thomas Nast and Frankie Pressman, with Richard Luthmann With the 2025 NYC Council elections on the horizon, Kamillah Hanks, who represents Staten Island's North Shore, faces a storm of opposition. Her political survival is in jeopardy as powerful New York City groups, law enforcement, and aspiring politicians gear up to challenge her in the upcoming NYC Council race. The District Leader race in the largely Democratic 61st Assembly District will play heavily as to who will represent Staten Island’s 49th District at City Hall. There are developments in that contest as well. The backlash against Hanks has been brewing for months, fueled by her controversial support of policies in defiance of NYC Mayor Eric Adams, NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and other influential figures and groups, her association with questionable figures, and a growing disconnect with her constituents. Some say the tension reached a boiling point this past weekend at the inaugural NYC Soul Food Festival at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, where Hanks' absence sparked widespread criticism. “She doesn’t even show up for her own community,” said one attendee, echoing a sentiment shared by many. “We deserve a representative who is present, listens, and cares. Kamillah Hanks is not that person.” The event, headlined by NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Commissioner for Cultural Affairs Laurie Cumbo, became a hotbed of discontent against Hanks. “People are tired of her,” said another festival-goer. “She’s not fighting for us. She’s fighting for herself and her cronies.” Comunity groups from Rosebank, Port Richmond, and Arlington are also expressing dissatisfaction with Hanks. Potential Challengers Eye 2025 Primary As Hanks’ popularity wanes, several political figures are positioning themselves to challenge her in the 2025 Democratic primary. Among them are Sarah Blas, a two-time candidate who has previously run for New York State Senate and U.S. Congress, and Selina Grey, a seasoned community organizer and political activist. Blas, who lives in the New York City Housing Authority’s Richmond Terrace Houses, has a history of advocating for social justice. Despite her multiple previous electoral defeats, Blas remains undeterred and is considering another run for the NYC Council seat. “This district needs real change,” Blas has previously stated. “I’ve seen our community's struggles, and I’m ready to bring meaningful change to the North Shore.” Selina Grey, a well-known figure in Staten Island’s North Shore community, was also eyeballing Hanks’ seat. However, sources say that after meetings with party leadership, she has decided to forgo complicating a NYC Council primary race in favor of a different political battle. Grey is a community organizer with the New York State Nurses Association and a mentor to young women through the Staten Island NAACP. She is now setting her sights on the 2025 District Leader race for the 61st Assembly District. That district, within the lines for Hanks’ Council seat, will be determinative in next June’s Democratic Primary Race. Grey has a tough task facing incumbent Jasmine “Jasi” Robinson, the current Female Democratic District Leader. Robinson, a prominent activist and member of the Staten Island Democratic Socialists of America, has strong roots in the district. She has been a vocal advocate"

Thomas Nast and Frankie Pressman, with Richard Luthmann With the 2025 NYC Council elections on the horizon, Kamillah Hanks, who represents Staten Island's North Shore, faces a storm of opposition. Her political survival is in jeopardy as powerful New York City groups, law enforcement, and aspiring politicians gear up to challenge her in the upcoming NYC Council race. The District Leader race in the largely Democratic 61st Assembly District will play heavily as to who will represent Staten Island’s 49th District at City Hall. There are developments in that contest as well. The backlash against Hanks has been brewing for months, fueled by her controversial support of policies in defiance of NYC Mayor Eric Adams, NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and other influential figures and groups, her association with questionable figures, and a growing disconnect with her constituents. Some say the tension reached a boiling point this past weekend at the inaugural NYC Soul Food Festival at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, where Hanks' absence sparked widespread criticism. “She doesn’t even show up for her own community,” said one attendee, echoing a sentiment shared by many. “We deserve a representative who is present, listens, and cares. Kamillah Hanks is not that person.” The event, headlined by NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Commissioner for Cultural Affairs Laurie Cumbo, became a hotbed of discontent against Hanks. “People are tired of her,” said another festival-goer. “She’s not fighting for us. She’s fighting for herself and her cronies.” Comunity groups from Rosebank, Port Richmond, and Arlington are also expressing dissatisfaction with Hanks. Potential Challengers Eye 2025 Primary As Hanks’ popularity wanes, several political figures are positioning themselves to challenge her in the 2025 Democratic primary. Among them are Sarah Blas, a two-time candidate who has previously run for New York State Senate and U.S. Congress, and Selina Grey, a seasoned community organizer and political activist. Blas, who lives in the New York City Housing Authority’s Richmond Terrace Houses, has a history of advocating for social justice. Despite her multiple previous electoral defeats, Blas remains undeterred and is considering another run for the NYC Council seat. “This district needs real change,” Blas has previously stated. “I’ve seen our community's struggles, and I’m ready to bring meaningful change to the North Shore.” Selina Grey, a well-known figure in Staten Island’s North Shore community, was also eyeballing Hanks’ seat. However, sources say that after meetings with party leadership, she has decided to forgo complicating a NYC Council primary race in favor of a different political battle. Grey is a community organizer with the New York State Nurses Association and a mentor to young women through the Staten Island NAACP. She is now setting her sights on the 2025 District Leader race for the 61st Assembly District. That district, within the lines for Hanks’ Council seat, will be determinative in next June’s Democratic Primary Race. Grey has a tough task facing incumbent Jasmine “Jasi” Robinson, the current Female Democratic District Leader. Robinson, a prominent activist and member of the Staten Island Democratic Socialists of America, has strong roots in the district. She has been a vocal advocate"

Powerful groups within New York City's political landscape are actively working to replace her. The Staten Island Democratic Party, led by Chair Laura Sword, has already begun interviewing candidates to primary Hanks. Sword, who is reportedly not on speaking terms with Hanks, is said to be leaning towards backing a challenger who aligns more closely with the party's values. “Kamillah does not respect the wishes of the rank and file, and that was clear when she snubbed Debi Rose for the Board of Elections position,” a county committee member said. Mayor Eric Adams and NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams have also distanced themselves from Hanks. Both leaders, frustrated with Hanks’ defiance and controversies, have made it clear that they want nothing to do with her. Their discontent with Hanks became evident after she championed the \"How Many Stops Act,\" a piece of legislation that City Hall opposed. In a decisive move, Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams stripped Hanks of her position as Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Public Safety, a significant demotion that weakened Hanks politically. She is now one of only two NYC Democrats without a committee chair, a clear sign of her diminishing influence within the Council. “The Mayor and the Speaker see Hanks as a liability,” said a Manhattan political consultant familiar with the situation. “They want someone who can work with them, not against them. They’re not just stepping away—they’re actively involved in finding her replacement.” According to sources, both Adamses have been sending potential candidates to meet with Laura Sword, indicating their commitment to ousting Hanks. Some are presently City Hall staffers. “They’re determined to find someone who can represent Staten Island’s North Shore without the baggage that Hanks carries,” the consultant added. Adding to Hanks’ woes, law enforcement unions, including the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), have turned their backs on her. The SBA, led by President Vincent Vallelong, publicly denounced Hanks for her support of the \"How Many Stops Act,\" a bill that mandates the NYPD to track investigative interactions with the public. Vallelong did not mince words, stating, \"She sold herself as pro-law enforcement for endorsements, but her vote exposes a lack of truthfulness and transparency. As Public Safety Committee Chair, her support of this idiotic bill demonstrates ignorance of police work and disregard for public safety.\" Hanks' relationship with law enforcement further deteriorated after her demotion by Mayor Adams and Speaker Adams. The loss of support from these key figures and the police unions has made Hanks’ re-election campaign an uphill battle. \"Once you lose the police unions, they never come back,\" said a seasoned NYC political consultant. \"And it’s near impossible to carry a district on Staten Island if you’re perceived as anti-cop.\" Scandals and Controversies Hanks’ political career has been marred by multiple scandals that have only added fuel to the fire. One of the most contentious issues is her association with the True2Life Organization, led by Malcolm Penn and Mike Perry. The group has been criticized for its public support of the parole of Shatiek Johnson, who murdered NYPD Officer Gerard Carter in 1998 on Staten Island. The decision to award a subcontract to True2Life for programming at the Gerard Carter Community Center in Stapleton, named after the slain officer, has sparked outrage. Jozette Carter-Williams, the widow of Officer Carter, expressed her vehement opposition to the move. “I support second chances. And I will support Shatiek Johnson's parole the day after my son has a chance to hug his father again,” Carter-Williams said. She added, \"I am incensed at the sentiments of the current councilmember and her selected associates, the True2Life Organization, which is anti-police and anti-NYPD and their families.\" Hanks has also faced backlash for allocating $105,000 in NYC Council funds to the Canvas Institute for Arts and Culture, a nonprofit led by Henry “Bobby Digi” Olisa, husband of NYC Cultural Affairs Commissioner Laurie"

    "text": "Cumbo. Critics have pointed to Digi’s past business and charitable connections, which the FBI has reportedly scrutinized, as evidence of concern and conflict of interest. It has been reported that Digi may be an FBI informant. “This isn’t about supporting the arts; it’s about cronyism,” said a community activist who asked to remain anonymous. “Hanks is using taxpayer money to reward her political allies. It’s disgraceful.” Kevin Barry Love: A Liability Hanks Can't Shake On a personal front, Hanks’ long-time partner, Kevin Barry Love, has become an increasing liability. Love, a millionaire real estate investor, has been described as a \"fixer\" for Hanks, allegedly engaging in strong-arm tactics and questionable deals. His involvement in Hanks’ political career has drawn considerable scrutiny, particularly in light of his legal troubles. Love and Hanks are embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Richard Luthmann, a former attorney seeking over $100,000 in unpaid legal fees and millions in compensatory and punitive damages. Luthmann, a contributor to this outlet, provided background and comments on this article. He spent four years in federal prison on charges he claims were politically motivated lawfare. Now, his probation has ended, and he wants his money. “Dopey Kevin didn’t like collections calls from my lawyers. So he called the FBI and the DOJ and said I was ‘witness tampering’ to avoid paying me. I was on paper at the time, so it was effectively a threat to bust me back to prison,” Luthmann said. “The only problem is that he lied to the Feds. Neither he nor Kamillah were ever witnesses. That’s a federal crime and is civilly actionable.” The lawsuit paints a damning picture of Love, accusing him of using the largesse of Hanks’ City Council Office to defraud federal authorities, enging in tortious interference with contracts, and plotting deceptive social media campaigns during Hanks' 2017 City Council primary election loss to Debi Rose. Luthmann’s lawsuit alleges that Love made menacing phone calls to his collection lawyers, leading to the withdrawal of the case against Hanks and her campaign without Luthmann’s consent. Love’s legal issues have only added to Hanks’ growing list of problems. His aggressive tactics and penchant for speaking out of turn have made him a significant liability, further complicating Hanks’ re-election efforts. “Kevin’s mouth has always gotten him in trouble,” Luthmann said. “He looks like a real fool how he is carrying on to avoid paying some bills. He just can’t help himself. I will let him talk Kamillah out of office and himself in the Brooklyn Federal lock-up.” Luthmann’s lawsuit also implicates Hanks in the broader scheme, suggesting that she has been complicit in Love’s actions. Luthmann says Love is Hanks' agent and fixer. “He’s her Luca Brazi. Only he’s not strong and very stupid,” Luthmann said. The legal battle is ongoing, and its outcome could have profound implications for Hanks' political future. The case has already damaged her reputation because of the revelation that Hanks was behind the 2017 campaign attacks on Debi Rose. The Road Ahead As the 2025 election nears, the question remains whether Kamillah Hanks can weather the storm of opposition and scandals. The growing calls for her replacement, coupled with the challenges from within her own party and the community, suggest that her path to re-election will be anything but smooth. Despite the mounting pressure, Hanks has remained defiant, insisting that her actions have been in the best interests of her constituents. \"My decision reflects the complexity of ensuring transparency and effective policing, a view my retired NYPD Sergeant grandfather would have shared,\" Hanks stated. However, with federal investigations potentially looming, her partner's legal issues, and her support base eroding, Hanks’ time in office may be running out. It remains to be seen whether she can rally enough support to fend off her challengers or will be replaced by a candidate more aligned with Staten Island’s values. The 2025 elections will undoubtedly be a pivotal moment for the future of Staten Island's North Shore and its representation in New York City politics.

His involvement in Hanks’ political career has drawn considerable scrutiny, particularly in light of his legal troubles. Love and Hanks are embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Richard Luthmann, a former attorney seeking over $100,000 in unpaid legal fees and millions in compensatory and punitive damages. Luthmann, a contributor to this outlet, provided background and comments on this article. He spent four years in federal prison on charges he claims were politically motivated lawfare. Now, his probation has ended, and he wants his money. “Dopey Kevin didn’t like collections calls from my lawyers. So he called the FBI and the DOJ and said I was ‘witness tampering’ to avoid paying me. I was on paper at the time, so it was effectively a threat to bust me back to prison,” Luthmann said. “The only problem is that he lied to the Feds. Neither he nor Kamillah were ever witnesses. That’s a federal crime and is civilly actionable.” The lawsuit paints a damning picture of Love, accusing him of using the largesse of Hanks’ City Council Office to defraud federal authorities, enging in tortious interference with contracts, and plotting deceptive social media campaigns during Hanks' 2017 City Council primary election loss to Debi Rose. Luthmann’s lawsuit alleges that Love made menacing phone calls to his collection lawyers, leading to the withdrawal of the case against Hanks and her campaign without Luthmann’s consent.

Among them is Jozette Carter-Williams, a (hopeful) primary challenger to Council Member Kamillah Hanks, a moderate Democrat who represents Staten Island’s North Shore. Carter-Williams was knocked off the ballot last week in a ruling by the Board of Elections after representatives for Hanks’ campaign challenged Carter-Williams’ petitions, citing insufficient signatures among other issues. But Carter-Williams is making a last-ditch effort to validate her petitions in court, with both her campaign and Hanks’ set to appear in Richmond County Supreme Court on Tuesday morning on the issue. Carter-Williams’ late ex-husband Gerard Carter was an NYPD officer who was killed in the line of duty in 1998. Last month, Carter-Williams was endorsed by the New York City Police Benevolent Association. Hanks ran for reelection unopposed in the Democratic primary in 2023. This year, she has three additional challengers who already made the ballot: Abou Diakhate, Telee Brown and Sarah Blas. Hanks has so far outraised them all easily, but both Blas and Diakhate have received matching funds – though still less than half of what Hanks has received in public funds payments. Carter-Williams isn’t the only hopeful City Council candidate making a final bid for the ballot. Former City Council Member and state senator Hiram Monserrate has been fundraising to run in the crowded Queens race to replace Council Member Francisco Moya, but was kicked off the ballot last week. He and his supporters are challenging a law that prevents people who have been convicted of corruption (as he has) from running for City Council.

Among them is Jozette Carter-Williams, a (hopeful) primary challenger to Council Member Kamillah Hanks, a moderate Democrat who represents Staten Island’s North Shore. Carter-Williams was knocked off the ballot last week in a ruling by the Board of Elections after representatives for Hanks’ campaign challenged Carter-Williams’ petitions, citing insufficient signatures among other issues. But Carter-Williams is making a last-ditch effort to validate her petitions in court, with both her campaign and Hanks’ set to appear in Richmond County Supreme Court on Tuesday morning on the issue. Carter-Williams’ late ex-husband Gerard Carter was an NYPD officer who was killed in the line of duty in 1998. Last month, Carter-Williams was endorsed by the New York City Police Benevolent Association. Hanks ran for reelection unopposed in the Democratic primary in 2023. This year, she has three additional challengers who already made the ballot: Abou Diakhate, Telee Brown and Sarah Blas. Hanks has so far outraised them all easily, but both Blas and Diakhate have received matching funds – though still less than half of what Hanks has received in public funds payments. Carter-Williams isn’t the only hopeful City Council candidate making a final bid for the ballot. Former City Council Member and state senator Hiram Monserrate has been fundraising to run in the crowded Queens race to replace Council Member Francisco Moya, but was kicked off the ballot last week. He and his supporters are challenging a law that prevents people who have been convicted of corruption (as he has) from running for City Council. Monserrate’s campaign told City & State they expect to have a court hearing in the next 10 days. Share This: NEXT STORY: Will the state budget deliver on Hochul’s affordability promises?
