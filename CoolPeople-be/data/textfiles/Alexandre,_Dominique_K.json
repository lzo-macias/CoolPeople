Transitioning to professional services was a significant change, but it’s been incredibly rewarding in a variety of ways, some of which I didn't expect: 1️⃣ Work-life balance Events demanded 24/7 commitment, especially during event days. Legal marketing, on the other hand, has provided the structure I needed to plan my life. 2️⃣ Challenging problem-solving I love tackling complex challenges, and legal marketing delivers. The sector’s slow adoption of data and systems surprised me, but understanding the complexities of legal and overcoming those barriers makes every win even more satisfying. 3️⃣ A broader skill set In events, I focused mainly on B2C. Now, I collaborate across seven departments with unique needs, constantly adapting and sharpening my expertise. 4️⃣ Growth through change This move coincided with big transformations in my life, and embracing the unknown has boosted my confidence and resilience. 5️⃣ A fresh perspective Coming from outside the legal world has been a huge asset. My events experience prepared me for high pressure and heavy workloads, allowing me to bring fresh ideas and demonstrate the value of external commercial insight. The move wasn’t without challenges, but it’s been worth it for the professional and personal growth. To anyone considering professional services I would say don't underestimate the value of events/outside experience!

Critics, including high-profile figures like Elon Musk, condemned the portrayal as offensive and inappropriate for such a global event. The ceremony also featured various acts that aimed to celebrate French history and culture with a modern twist. One notable act included a depiction of Marie Antoinette with drag makeup, holding her severed head, which further fueled the controversy. Supporters of the ceremony defended it as a form of artistic expression intended to challenge norms and provoke thought, while detractors viewed it as a sign of cultural decay and a mockery of deeply held beliefs.There could have been a better way: Respectful Historical Representation 📜 Focus on historically accurate and respectful depictions of significant cultural and religious figures without parody or mockery. Eg: Highlight France's rich history with a dignified portrayal of key moments and figures, such as the Enlightenment or the contributions of French scientists and artists. Inclusive Cultural Performances 🌍 Include traditional dances, music, and art forms from various cultures to celebrate global unity and diversity. Eg: Feature a segment where artists from different countries collaborate on a performance that showcases a blend of their unique cultural heritages. Modern Technology and Innovation 🚀 Use advanced technology like augmented reality (AR) and drones to create stunning visual effects that tell a cohesive story. Eg: A light show with drones that forms symbols and landmarks from around the world, illustrating the theme of global unity and progress. Environmental and Social Themes 🌱 Highlight themes of sustainability, environmental protection, and social progress to inspire positive action. Eg: A segment dedicated to environmental conservation, showcasing initiatives and heroes working to save the planet, with immersive visuals and storytelling. Honoring Athletes' Journeys 🏅 Focus on the stories and journeys of the athletes, celebrating their hard work, dedication, and the spirit of the Olympics. Eg Short documentaries or live performances that share inspiring stories of athletes overcoming obstacles to reach the Olympics.

Eg: Highlight France's rich history with a dignified portrayal of key moments and figures, such as the Enlightenment or the contributions of French scientists and artists. Inclusive Cultural Performances 🌍 Include traditional dances, music, and art forms from various cultures to celebrate global unity and diversity. Eg: Feature a segment where artists from different countries collaborate on a performance that showcases a blend of their unique cultural heritages. Modern Technology and Innovation 🚀 Use advanced technology like augmented reality (AR) and drones to create stunning visual effects that tell a cohesive story. Eg: A light show with drones that forms symbols and landmarks from around the world, illustrating the theme of global unity and progress.

Eg: A segment dedicated to environmental conservation, showcasing initiatives and heroes working to save the planet, with immersive visuals and storytelling. Honoring Athletes' Journeys 🏅 Focus on the stories and journeys of the athletes, celebrating their hard work, dedication, and the spirit of the Olympics.
