Sus esfuerzos llevaron a la aprobación de la ley local 31 de 2023, que reconoce el abuso económico como violencia doméstica. Además, lideró una coalición diversa en Albany, luchando por una causa civil para las sobrevivientes de violencia doméstica que enfrentan deudas forzadas. Su presencia constante en el Ayuntamiento y en Albany, y su compromiso de obtener resultados, han dejado un impacto duradero en las comunidades a las que sirve, lo que le valió ser reconocido como una de las personas más influyentes en relaciones gubernamentales por CITY & STATE en 2023. Durante la pandemia, Wil organizó una huelga de alquileres contra un casero negligente, logrando una victoria legal y la condonación de una deuda considerable, cercana a seis cifras. Wil reside en el distrito con su esposa, Luisa, y su hijo, Lucas Sebastián. Participan activamente como voluntarios en diversas organizaciones sin fines de lucro de la ciudad. Wil también forma parte de la junta directiva de Union Settlement, del Consejo Asesor Comunitario del Hospital Metropolitano, del Comité de Vivienda de la Junta Comunitaria 11, y fue becario del Consejo de Profesionales Urbanos (CUP) y del programa Bridges-NY del Consejo de Relaciones Comunitarias Judías (JCRC).

I am committed to creating real affordable housing, ensuring that people of all income levels can stay in the community. My plan includes building more housing at affordable and middle-income levels to increase supply and bring down rents, addressing housing instability, and holding corporate landlords accountable for vacant properties. Learn More Learn More Addressing Public Safety Members of the community are concerned about rising crime, drug-related violence, and a lack of police presence. I understand the urgency of making our streets safer while addressing the root causes of crime. This means increasing investments in education, poverty reduction, and mental health care, while also ensuring a balanced police presence that protects all communities without over-policing low-income neighborhoods. I am dedicated to creating a safer environment for everyone, from East Harlem to the South Bronx.

The visibility of homelessness, especially among individuals struggling with mental health and substance use disorder, is a pressing concern. My plan addresses both the short-term and long-term needs by building more supportive housing for low-income residents and investing in mental health and social services. I aim to provide effective solutions that help those in need while improving the overall quality of life in our neighborhoods.
