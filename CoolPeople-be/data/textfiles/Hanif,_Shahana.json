This year, the office partnered with two local public high schools to deepen youth civic engagement and expand democratic participation. The $1.5 million in funding will go toward the following six community-driven projects that reflect the district’s deep commitment to civic engagement and local democracy. Capital Projects Renovate 3 Bathrooms at PS 282 ($450,000) – 4,004 votes Prospect Park Historic Willink Restroom Restoration ($500,000) – 3,690 votes Revamp Neglected John Jay Library into Media Hub ($450,000) – 3,639 votes Expense Projects Free Summer Arts Program for Low-Income Kindergartners ($10,000) – 3,466 votes Youth Voice For Justice: Training Students in Conflict Resolution ($20,000) – 2,588 votes Launch Women-Owned Businesses in Kensington ($12,000) – 2,540 votes Of the total 8,374 votes , 4,282 ballots were submitted online , giving District 39 the highest digital turnout among the 25 City Council districts participating this year. Additionally, 4,092 votes were cast using paper ballots . This record-breaking turnout was made possible thanks to the dedication of dozens of community volunteers, PB Delegates, and Steering Committee Members, led by Hannah Henderson-Charnow, the office’s Organizing and Budget Director. Under her leadership, Participatory Budgeting continues to grow across the district. In this PB Cycle, Council Member Hanif piloted a partnership with district high schools—Brooklyn Collaborative Studies and the John Jay Educational Complex—to involve student leaders in every step of the process. Students identified community needs within their schools, collaborated with city agencies to turn ideas into ballot proposals, and conducted voter outreach to bring their peers into the decision-making process. This year’s turnout surpassed all previous records, including 2019, which saw 7,683 total votes (5,739 online and 1,944 paper) and 2017, with 7,156 total votes (4,651 online and 2,505 paper) . PB was introduced in New York City 14 years ago, beginning in City Council District 39, and has since expanded to 25 Council Districts. At a time when trust in government is declining and federal funding for democracy initiatives is under threat, PB offers a powerful, local vision of democracy, serving as both an educational tool and a meaningful way to engage residents in decision-making.

In my decade-long involvement in PB—first as a volunteer, then as the Participatory Budgeting Director in my predecessor’s office, and now as Council Member—I’ve seen firsthand how the initiative brings together people of all ages, languages, neighborhoods, and immigration status,” said Council Member Shahana Hanif. “Participatory Budgeting continues to thrive as a powerful pathway to civic leadership. I’m deeply grateful to the District 39 PB Delegates and Steering Committee for their hard work developing this year’s ballot.” “The Participatory Budgeting process has been deeply grounding and meaningful for me and PS 282 students, staff, and parents,” said Christina, PS 282 Parent. “I’ve loved getting to know my neighbors, and I’m grateful for their support of our project. It’s amazing that this elementary school building will be getting some much-needed renovation to be more student-centered, and even more so that the community voted for it and is behind the project. That means the world to us.” “We are so grateful to the constituents of District 39, who have shown so much love for Prospect Park over the years, for their ongoing support of the park and its care,” said Deborah Kirschner, Vice President for External Relations, Prospect Park Alliance. “The restoration of the Willink Restroom is a much needed overhaul to be able to provide accessible and welcoming restroom facilities in"

This year, the office partnered with two local public high schools to deepen youth civic engagement and expand democratic participation. The $1.5 million in funding will go toward the following six community-driven projects that reflect the district’s deep commitment to civic engagement and local democracy. Capital Projects Renovate 3 Bathrooms at PS 282 ($450,000) – 4,004 votes Prospect Park Historic Willink Restroom Restoration ($500,000) – 3,690 votes Revamp Neglected John Jay Library into Media Hub ($450,000) – 3,639 votes Expense Projects Free Summer Arts Program for Low-Income Kindergartners ($10,000) – 3,466 votes Youth Voice For Justice: Training Students in Conflict Resolution ($20,000) – 2,588 votes Launch Women-Owned Businesses in Kensington ($12,000) – 2,540 votes Of the total 8,374 votes , 4,282 ballots were submitted online , giving District 39 the highest digital turnout among the 25 City Council districts participating this year. Additionally, 4,092 votes were cast using paper ballots . This record-breaking turnout was made possible thanks to the dedication of dozens of community volunteers, PB Delegates, and Steering Committee Members, led by Hannah Henderson-Charnow, the office’s Organizing and Budget Director. Under her leadership, Participatory Budgeting continues to grow across the district. In this PB Cycle, Council Member Hanif piloted a partnership with district high schools—Brooklyn Collaborative Studies and the John Jay Educational Complex—to involve student leaders in every step of the process. Students identified community needs within their schools, collaborated with city agencies to turn ideas into ballot proposals, and conducted voter outreach to bring their peers into the decision-making process. This year’s turnout surpassed all previous records, including 2019, which saw 7,683 total votes (5,739 online and 1,944 paper) and 2017, with 7,156 total votes (4,651 online and 2,505 paper) . PB was introduced in New York City 14 years ago, beginning in City Council District 39, and has since expanded to 25 Council Districts. At a time when trust in government is declining and federal funding for democracy initiatives is under threat, PB offers a powerful, local vision of democracy, serving as both an educational tool and a meaningful way to engage residents in decision-making.

Students identified community needs within their schools, collaborated with city agencies to turn ideas into ballot proposals, and conducted voter outreach to bring their peers into the decision-making process. This year’s turnout surpassed all previous records, including 2019, which saw 7,683 total votes (5,739 online and 1,944 paper) and 2017, with 7,156 total votes (4,651 online and 2,505 paper) . PB was introduced in New York City 14 years ago, beginning in City Council District 39, and has since expanded to 25 Council Districts. At a time when trust in government is declining and federal funding for democracy initiatives is under threat, PB offers a powerful, local vision of democracy, serving as both an educational tool and a meaningful way to engage residents in decision-making.

The Circle Keepers is elated to have won this year and are looking forward to continuing the work of Youth Led Restorative Justice training in D39.” “Participatory Budgeting is the only program I know where constituents can directly decide how their tax dollars are spent,” said Jared Rich, Esq., PB Delegate. “It’s civics in action and a chance for communities to fund projects that would otherwise be out of reach.” “I met so many cool people through the PB process, new people in the community, even though I have been here for 20 years,” said Nick Nyhan, Park Slope Resident, Founder of the City Sponge, and PB Delegate . “People want to talk about things they care about.

This has shown me how people will engage when given the chance.” “I recommend the PB volunteer committee to anyone looking for a hands-on way to help distribute 1.5 million dollars back into the local community in a very thoughtful way,” said Marilee, Park Slope Resident and PB Volunteer. “Being on the PB volunteer committee gave me a window into our local government. I felt empowered to develop robust projects to benefit my local community in a very hands-on way that I hadn’t experienced before.” ### About Council Member Shahana Hanif: Council Member Shahana Hanif represents Brooklyn’s 39th District and is Co-Chair of the New York City Council’s Progressive Caucus and the Council’s Task Force to Combat Hate.

My parents came to Brooklyn from rural Chittagong, Bangladesh, seeking a better life—a life grounded in safety, economic justice, and the promise of democracy.” SURVIVING LUPUS “At 17, everything changed. I was diagnosed with Lupus, an incurable illness that almost killed me. I was rushed from one Brooklyn hospital to another, undergoing treatments that left me bedridden. I lost all my hair and had to undergo both hip and left shoulder replacements. Without insurance and navigating a healthcare system that wasn’t built for people like me, I faced countless barriers—from a lack of translation services to a transit system that was nearly impossible to navigate in my condition. But through it all I had to learn how to fight for myself. That experience taught me resilience, and fueled my commitment to fight for a city where everyone has the support they need.” ORGANIZING FOR PROGRESS “Surviving Lupus showed me just how hard it is to survive in this city—and how many of our communities are hurting. I knew I had to do something to make a difference. That’s when I became a community organizer. I founded the Muslim Writers Collective, creating a powerful space for young Muslims to share their stories and strategies for resilience and joy.” As a community organizer with CAAAV, I spent two years building tenant power with Bangladeshi and Asian NYCHA residents at the Queensbridge Houses. These residents had faced discrimination and language barriers for years, but together we won critical upgrades and repairs, and fought for the funding our communities needed. I also worked directly with survivors of domestic violence to ensure they could safely escape abusive situations. Over a decade ago, I joined Sakhi for South Asian Survivors to support their work in Kensington, where they had the highest intake of survivors. With my neighbors, I helped form The Kensington Stewards to transform an empty lot into Avenue C Plaza, a vibrant public space for everyone to enjoy. There weren’t enough parks or open spaces for children to play or for women to take up space. So, we built the plaza and activated it with cultural programming to make it a true community hub.” DELIVERING FOR THE DISTRICT “In 2017, I joined then-Council Member Brad Lander’s office as Director of Organizing & Community Engagement. There, I resolved thousands of constituent cases and led initiatives like Participatory Budgeting, giving our community a direct voice in how millions of City dollars are spent. It was during this time I learned how city government can be a powerful tool for proactive change—delivering results block by block. Now, as your City Council Member, I’ve continued this commitment to responsive, action-driven service. Since taking office in January 2022, my team and I have handled over 3,000 constituent requests, ranging from increased traffic enforcement to improved sanitation services.” For example, after receiving multiple complaints about trash on Court Street, we secured additional trash cans within just 48 hours. That’s what real constituent service looks like—swift, efficient action that directly improves your daily life. Some of our highlights: We’ve made significant strides in accessibility, including opening the elevators at the 7th Avenue F/G station, building a protected bike lane on 9th Street, and installing wheelchair-accessible swings at Van Voorhees Park. We’ve also expanded critical community services: our immigration legal clinic in Kensington now operates weekly, and our monthly food distribution has provided nearly 2,500 bags of food to working-class families in 2024. Also in 2024, District 39 entered the top 10 City Council districts for new affordable housing, with the opening of 633 units and the Gowanus rezoning paving the way for thousands more. Additionally, we’ve secured over $20 million in new funding for schools, parks, infrastructure, vital non-profits, affordable housing, and Participatory Budgeting projects. STANDING UP FOR YOU “As a Council Member and Co-Chair of the Progressive Caucus, I have been at the forefront of the fight for transformational change. I’m proud of the innovative legislation I’ve written and passed, including measures to expand access to reproductive healthcare, establish universal compost for the first time in NYC, and create a Workers’ Bill of Rights that’s now posted at worksites across the city.

But it’s not enough to simply avoid Adams’s cruel cuts and austerity measures. We deserve an equitable City budget—one that reflects our values and supports all our communities. That’s why I voted against his 2023 and 2024 budgets. I’m ready to use every tool of city government to protect every block of the 39th district from Trump’s MAGA agenda.
