As a self described “pruning hook” politician, Smithie never believed in raising property or sales taxes on a few notable others – when we have millions of other options to explore. And as a reconstructionist, Smithie said, “I believe in General Ulysses Grant. I trust in what he said about reconstruction, the general welfare of the poor and less fortunate Americans in his memoir of 1885.” With this in mind, Ladies and Gentlemen, do not be too surprised if I say, “my main focus – if elected into a public office, will be to use General Grant’s view of duty and care for every single American, to revive the health of New York city, the economy of the rust belt states, the gulf coast states, California, and farming communities in the western states – all of whom have been neglected by past Presidents for the past twenty five years.” “My goal is to ReBuildNewYorkCity and ReBuildUSAtoday – through these communities.

I plan to update aging infrastructures nationwide, strengthen the middle class, boost small businesses, and make certain a future for our millennials. And I will do it by synthesizing ways of dealing with “climate change” for the economic benefit of all. And I will do it according to what was in the book of Genesis 1:26 and 1 Thessalonians 5:21. By keeping in line with the American constitution, the Bible – if I may say, my party’s charter and bylaws, Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand here today to present a brief insight into my green but sustainable plan. By focusing on climate change and material technology alone, a green but sustainable plan will not only improve our quality of life, it will boost the current economy ten times better than what we have at the moment. And this is because I see climate change as a key actor that not only touches upon us all, I see it as an actor that affect services, affect our distribution network and the effectiveness of how we interact within and outside these network. For now, my goal is to set New York city straight, do what was done after the American civil war and the great depression era to get New York city back on track, to Reform the NYPD, build affordable housing, create jobs, solve problem of homelessness in public places and in public schools, set up a public healthcare and a universal insurance plan for the all in the city, put a freeze property tax and rent hike, then boost small businesses as a way to maintain a sustainable economy for the next fifty years.” Once featured in WSJ, the New York Times and at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Abbey Laurel-Smith started life as a professional artist, and a pseudo song writer with two BBC live performance credits to his name.

I will use your tax to encourage innovations, promote American industries and re-invigorate economically depressed communities all over the country. Subsidies, aids, sovereign grants and loans would be spend at home, as I will not only be seeing to be making internal improvements to our aging infrastructures, I will use it to build an economic system where the man who puts the land to use – through farming or mining, reigns over the man who’s main aim is to hold onto a built structure.

And watch me ReBuildUSAtoday”. Manhattan, July 26th, 2024. Abbey Laurel-Smith, a Know-Nothing Party of America candidate, with a passion to “rebuild not replace”, made public his candidacy for President, United States, 2024 at the Omni Berkshire Hotel Bar in Midtown, Manhattan, New York city last month. In his opening statement, he promised a return to Henry Clay’s common “American” sense, as the best way to map out a future for the next generation of Americans. “This native “Know-Nothing” pedestrian and most realistic approach”, he claimed, “is the best way to go about setting up a type of economic security for decades to come. It is also the best way to secure an environment that is not only sustainable to us all, but one that is safe, secure and adaptive to host a smart and a self regulating technology”. He promised to ReBuildUSAtoday by securing the southern borders with ICBM tracking bases, space monitoring stations, air bases, boost the number of naval footprint in the Gulf Coast. Tackling border patrol and security impediments like land ownership, eminent domain and prohibition-era rules that are still in place in some southern border areas should never have been overlooked. He plans to revise tax codes, credits and granted exemptions. He will do away with cumbersome rules and regulations that are burdensome to startups and small businesses so he could revitalize the economy, re-energize small businesses, drive up the spirit of invention, boost channels of supply nationwide, as well as nurture entrepreneurship in economically depressed communities in the rust belt states, the farm states, and other neglected parts of the United States. “Current challenges facing the country today” he says, “could not be addressed by continuing along the lines of current policies – foreign and domestic, and a military styled economic system that have proven to be harmful and detrimental to how we deal with our America’s safety, security, wealth disparity, affordable housing and issues of growth”. “Hard to imagine”, he continues, “that some counties in the United States haven’t had a birth in the last six months. But if that is the reality in some parts of America of today, then it is the President’s responsibility to the American people to use policy instruments at his/her disposal to put an end to a few bad habits that are fashionable but dangerous and damaging to our traditional values. It is imperative we encourage and boost birth rates in Protestant American homes. It is the only way we can address this fast dwindling population of Americans, as well as replace those who are opting for the LGBTQ life style. To start this rebuilding process, Abbey Laurel-Smith is proposing four immediate steps. First is a return to a pre WWII Anglo Protestant economic system that served the country from 1812 to 1942. It is a system that gave precedence to value rate by cancelling out vanguard roles for speculated rates and as inflated rates. It is the only way we could grow our economy, boost our GDP and transfer wealth, pride and home ownership back to rural areas. Second is a roll back of the foreign office and the state department to its earliest days – when it was created around the Baptist and Methodist Churches. As a nation we don’t have a Pope or an Archbishop, yet these two bodies use the powers granted to them by this newly created office in July of 1789 to set up a plan that eventually led to the introduction of democracy and spread of christianity in Africa through the establishment of the sovereign state of Liberia in the 1800’s. Nothing wrong in adopting ther same stance in the Middle East and in some parts of Asia today. Third, we need to reckon with the fact that this is a placeholder Presidential"

He promised to ReBuildUSAtoday by securing the southern borders with ICBM tracking bases, space monitoring stations, air bases, boost the number of naval footprint in the Gulf Coast. Tackling border patrol and security impediments like land ownership, eminent domain and prohibition-era rules that are still in place in some southern border areas should never have been overlooked. He plans to revise tax codes, credits and granted exemptions. He will do away with cumbersome rules and regulations that are burdensome to startups and small businesses so he could revitalize the economy, re-energize small businesses, drive up the spirit of invention, boost channels of supply nationwide, as well as nurture entrepreneurship in economically depressed communities in the rust belt states, the farm states, and other neglected parts of the United States. “Current challenges facing the country today” he says, “could not be addressed by continuing along the lines of current policies – foreign and domestic, and a military styled economic system that have proven to be harmful and detrimental to how we deal with our America’s safety, security, wealth disparity, affordable housing and issues of growth”. “Hard to imagine”, he continues, “that some counties in the United States haven’t had a birth in the last six months. But if that is the reality in some parts of America of today, then it is the President’s responsibility to the American people to use policy instruments at his/her disposal to put an end to a few bad habits that are fashionable but dangerous and damaging to our traditional values. It is imperative we encourage and boost birth rates in Protestant American homes. It is the only way we can address this fast dwindling population of Americans, as well as replace those who are opting for the LGBTQ life style. To start this rebuilding process, Abbey Laurel-Smith is proposing four immediate steps. First is a return to a pre WWII Anglo Protestant economic system that served the country from 1812 to 1942. It is a system that gave precedence to value rate by cancelling out vanguard roles for speculated rates and as inflated rates. It is the only way we could grow our economy, boost our GDP and transfer wealth, pride and home ownership back to rural areas. Second is a roll back of the foreign office and the state department to its earliest days – when it was created around the Baptist and Methodist Churches. As a nation we don’t have a Pope or an Archbishop, yet these two bodies use the powers granted to them by this newly created office in July of 1789 to set up a plan that eventually led to the introduction of democracy and spread of christianity in Africa through the establishment of the sovereign state of Liberia in the 1800’s. Nothing wrong in adopting ther same stance in the Middle East and in some parts of Asia today. Third, we need to reckon with the fact that this is a placeholder Presidential"

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Campaign statement Donate to this campaign to help ReBuildUSAtoday Abbey Laurel-Smith steps in to the race as a Know-Nothing Republican for President 2024, with a simple message, “Put me in charge! And watch me ReBuildUSAtoday”. Manhattan, July 26th, 2024. Abbey Laurel-Smith, a Know-Nothing Party of America candidate, with a passion to “rebuild not replace”, made public his candidacy for President, United States, 2024 at the Omni Berkshire Hotel Bar in Midtown, Manhattan, New York city last month. In his opening statement, he promised a return to Henry Clay’s common “American” sense, as the best way to map out a future for the next generation of Americans. “This native “Know-Nothing” pedestrian and most realistic approach”, he claimed, “is the best way to go about setting up a type of economic security for decades to come. It is also the best way to secure an environment that is not only sustainable to us all, but one that is safe, secure and adaptive to host a smart and a self regulating technology”. He promised to ReBuildUSAtoday by securing the southern borders with ICBM tracking bases, space monitoring stations, air bases, boost the number of naval footprint in the Gulf Coast. Tackling border patrol and security impediments like land ownership, eminent domain and prohibition-era rules that are still in place in some southern border areas should never have been overlooked. He plans to revise tax codes, credits and granted exemptions. He will do away with cumbersome rules and regulations that are burdensome to startups and small businesses so he could revitalize the economy, re-energize small businesses, drive up the spirit of invention, boost channels of supply nationwide, as well as nurture entrepreneurship in economically depressed communities in the rust belt states, the farm states, and other neglected parts of the United States. “Current challenges facing the country today” he says, “could not be addressed by continuing along the lines of current policies – foreign and domestic, and a military styled economic system that have proven to be harmful and detrimental to how we deal with our America’s safety, security, wealth disparity, affordable housing and issues of growth”. “Hard to imagine”, he continues, “that some counties in the United States haven’t had a birth in the last six months. But if that is the reality in some parts of America of today, then it is the President’s responsibility to the American people to use policy instruments at his/her disposal to put an end to a few bad habits that are fashionable but dangerous and damaging to our traditional values. It is imperative we encourage and boost birth rates in Protestant American homes. It is the only way we can address this fast dwindling population of Americans, as well as replace those who are opting for the LGBTQ life style. To start this rebuilding process, Abbey Laurel-Smith is proposing four immediate steps. First is a return to a pre WWII Anglo Protestant economic system that served the country from 1812 to 1942. It is a system that gave precedence to value rate by cancelling out vanguard roles for speculated rates and as inflated rates. It is the only way we could grow our economy, boost"
