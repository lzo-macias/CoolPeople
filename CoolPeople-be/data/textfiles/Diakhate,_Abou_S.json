(Courtesy: Abou Diakhate) By Paul Liotta | pliotta@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — A longtime advocate for Staten Island’s immigrant community recently announced he’s running for the North Shore City Council seat. Abou Diakhate, of Stapleton, held a campaign launch event Jan. 26, and said recently that he’s focused on issues around affordability and quality of life. “I am running for City Council because I believe in our shared potential and our power to create a brighter future for the North Shore,” he said. “I believe if I’m elected we can transform our community into a place where family thrives, businesses will flourish, and every resident on the North Shore feels that they are part of the process.” Diakhate, a native of Senegal, has held a variety of roles in non-profit and government agencies, including the United Nations. He said issues, like improved transportation, healthcare options and education, would be his focus if elected. Throughout 2023, Diakhate acted as a vocal advocate for the immigrant community during the city’s migrant crisis. The candidate ran for the seat in 2021, but was removed from the ballot after a competitor’s petition challenge that year. In this year’s election, Diakhate is one of five candidates hoping to unseat Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore), who took office following the 2021 election. All five challengers to the incumbent — Diakhate, Jozette Carter-Williams, Sarah Blas, Neil Berry, and Aidan Rivera — are running as Democrats facing off in the June primary. Hanks cruised to re-election in 2023 facing no primary challenger and easily defeating an upstart third-party candidate. The incumbent has a significant fundraising lead over her competitors raising $77,440 through Jan. 11, according to data from the city Campaign Finance Board. The 2025 primaries will be done using ranked-choice voting, and Diakhate said there’s a possibility the non-traditional form of voting could impact the outcome. He said he would be open to possible alliances with other candidates in the race in which they would encourage supporters to rank each other over other opponents. “In ranked choice vote, you don’t need enemies, you need allies,” he said. “I will make sure I have allies, not enemies, in this race.” MORE POLITICAL NEWS City Council candidate, ex-wife of slain NYPD officer, withdraws candidacy When should voters expect results in Staten Island special election?

(Courtesy: Abou Diakhate) By Paul Liotta | pliotta@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — A longtime advocate for Staten Island’s immigrant community recently announced he’s running for the North Shore City Council seat. Abou Diakhate, of Stapleton, held a campaign launch event Jan. 26, and said recently that he’s focused on issues around affordability and quality of life. “I am running for City Council because I believe in our shared potential and our power to create a brighter future for the North Shore,” he said. “I believe if I’m elected we can transform our community into a place where family thrives, businesses will flourish, and every resident on the North Shore feels that they are part of the process.” Diakhate, a native of Senegal, has held a variety of roles in non-profit and government agencies, including the United Nations. He said issues, like improved transportation, healthcare options and education, would be his focus if elected. Throughout 2023, Diakhate acted as a vocal advocate for the immigrant community during the city’s migrant crisis. The candidate ran for the seat in 2021, but was removed from the ballot after a competitor’s petition challenge that year. In this year’s election, Diakhate is one of five candidates hoping to unseat Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore), who took office following the 2021 election. All five challengers to the incumbent — Diakhate, Jozette Carter-Williams, Sarah Blas, Neil Berry, and Aidan Rivera — are running as Democrats facing off in the June primary. Hanks cruised to re-election in 2023 facing no primary challenger and easily defeating an upstart third-party candidate. The incumbent has a significant fundraising lead over her competitors raising $77,440 through Jan. 11, according to data from the city Campaign Finance Board. The 2025 primaries will be done using ranked-choice voting, and Diakhate said there’s a possibility the non-traditional form of voting could impact the outcome. He said he would be open to possible alliances with other candidates in the race in which they would encourage supporters to rank each other over other opponents. “In ranked choice vote, you don’t need enemies, you need allies,” he said. “I will make sure I have allies, not enemies, in this race.” MORE POLITICAL NEWS City Council candidate, ex-wife of slain NYPD officer, withdraws candidacy When should voters expect results in Staten Island special election?

(Courtesy: Richards campaign) By Kristin F. Dalton | kdalton@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Abou Sy Diakhate was removed from the North Shore City Council ballot following a petition challenge from people associated with Kelvin Richards’ campaign. Diakhate’s campaign said Siaka Blake and Manuel Ortega, Richards’ campaign attorney, made the formal objections. “Petitioning during a pandemic is dangerous for the petitioners and those signing, which is why relatively few candidates citywide were challenged this year,” said Diakhate. “None of my other opponents’ petitions were questioned.” He believes his signatures were challenged because he and Richards were both competing for the African immigrant vote. “It speaks to his character,” he continued. “It’s obvious Kelvin is behind this. Otherwise, who is paying Manny Ortega.” Aarod Hecht, managing director for Richards’ campaign, declined to comment when asked about the decision to challenge only Diakhate’s signatures when there are eight other candidates on the ballot. Instead, Hecht provided a statement from African community leader Brima Sylla. “[Richards’] story and public service resonates not just with the African community, but all voters, and everyone I speak to in the community stands behind Kelvin and is rejecting others’ negativity,” Sylla said. Diakhate’s acting campaign manager Roy Moskowitz said it was a “bad strategic decision by Richards’ campaign.” “There are 9 candidates on the ballot. Other candidate supporters won’t consider including Kelvin under rank choice because of the mean spiritedness of challenging petitions in the age of COVID. Additionally, New York City Campaign Finance Law sets fixed spending limits for Council candidates. Money Richards’ campaign squandered on challenging Abou cannot be spent on more productive activities,” said acting campaign manager Roy Moskowitz. Diakhate’s campaign is researching the possibility of being restored by having federal court rule that signature requirements during a pandemic violates voting rights regulations. Last month all but one of Staten Island’s Democratic candidates for borough president signed a joint promise not to challenge petition signatures. The candidates said they want the June primary to determine who will be the Democratic choice in the general election and do not want to go through the process of fighting petition technicalities in court amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “Forcing campaigns to put staff and community members at risk by continuing petitioning longer than necessary is antithetical to our united goal of a safe and effective recovery from COVID-19,” the pledge says. It continues, “Democrats should allow primary voters to decide who will represent them in the general election using the city’s new ranked choice voting system, rather than backroom dealings between staff and campaign lawyers.” FOLLOW KRISTIN F.

Dalton | kdalton@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Abou Sy Diakhate was removed from the North Shore City Council ballot following a petition challenge from people associated with Kelvin Richards’ campaign. Diakhate’s campaign said Siaka Blake and Manuel Ortega, Richards’ campaign attorney, made the formal objections. “Petitioning during a pandemic is dangerous for the petitioners and those signing, which is why relatively few candidates citywide were challenged this year,” said Diakhate. “None of my other opponents’ petitions were questioned.” He believes his signatures were challenged because he and Richards were both competing for the African immigrant vote. “It speaks to his character,” he continued. “It’s obvious Kelvin is behind this. Otherwise, who is paying Manny Ortega.” Aarod Hecht, managing director for Richards’ campaign, declined to comment when asked about the decision to challenge only Diakhate’s signatures when there are eight other candidates on the ballot. Instead, Hecht provided a statement from African community leader Brima Sylla. “[Richards’] story and public service resonates not just with the African community, but all"
