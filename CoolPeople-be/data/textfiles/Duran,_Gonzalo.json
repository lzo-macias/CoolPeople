This is not just a campaign—it is a movement ingrained in the belief that New York City deserves leadership that is as dynamic and diverse as its people. Recently, Patrick McManus, Chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, challenged our members at our monthly meeting to step up and take action. I am proud to say that I was the first to answer that call and put my bid forward. With a background shaped by military service, leadership in the nonprofit sector, and hands-on experience in county-level politics, I stand ready to serve the great people of New York City with unwavering commitment. My passion for this city and its residents fuels my desire to make New York safer, more livable, and a place where every New Yorker can thrive. One of the greatest challenges we face in today’s political system is a lack of true diversity and representation. Too often, those in power are chosen by entrenched interests, not by the people themselves. This disconnect between leadership and the real needs of our city has left us grappling with critical issues—crime, rising costs, and the erosion of our quality of life. The time has come for us to take a stand. I believe the Conservative Party has an opportunity—and an obligation—to be bold in this race. We must not compromise our principles or dilute our vision. We must stand firm and put forth a candidate who represents the values of hard work, personal responsibility, and a deep commitment to the future of New York City. The progress we have made in recent elections shows the strength of our movement, and now is not the time to retreat. We must move forward with purpose and determination. I am committed to being the voice of conservatives across all five boroughs. I have already begun conversations with leaders in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, and I look forward to meeting with those in Queens and Staten Island in the days ahead. Together, we will build a united front that reflects the heart and soul of our city—a city that embraces its diversity, honors its history, and faces its challenges with a clear-eyed vision for the future. I am determined to gain the support of county and state party leadership, and to build on the momentum we have already established. We cannot afford to let our party’s influence weaken or miss this critical moment to bring real, lasting change to New York City. If I am elected mayor, I will fully and properly fund the New York Police Department, ensuring that our officers have the resources they need to protect and serve all New Yorkers. I will take a firm stance against crime, focusing on tackling issues like drugs, prostitution, and repeat offenders, and holding criminals accountable for their actions. At the same time, my administration will work hand in hand with community leaders to create a city that is inclusive, safe, and respectful of every New Yorker’s rights. Restoring affordability to New York City is one of my most pressing goals. Achieving this will require not only the full support of my administration but also the collective effort of all New Yorkers. Together, we can begin to tackle the housing crisis, reduce the cost of living, and ensure that our city remains accessible to those who have helped build it. What happens here in New York City has ripple effects across the nation—our actions set the tone for the rest of the country, and we have the opportunity to lead by example. This is a crucial moment for New York City. We are at a crossroads, and the decisions we make today will shape the future for generations to come. Together, we can"

This is not just a campaign—it is a movement ingrained in the belief that New York City deserves leadership that is as dynamic and diverse as its people. Recently, Patrick McManus, Chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, challenged our members at our monthly meeting to step up and take action. I am proud to say that I was the first to answer that call and put my bid forward. With a background shaped by military service, leadership in the nonprofit sector, and hands-on experience in county-level politics, I stand ready to serve the great people of New York City with unwavering commitment. My passion for this city and its residents fuels my desire to make New York safer, more livable, and a place where every New Yorker can thrive. One of the greatest challenges we face in today’s political system is a lack of true diversity and representation. Too often, those in power are chosen by entrenched interests, not by the people themselves. This disconnect between leadership and the real needs of our city has left us grappling with critical issues—crime, rising costs, and the erosion of our quality of life. The time has come for us to take a stand. I believe the Conservative Party has an opportunity—and an obligation—to be bold in this race. We must not compromise our principles or dilute our vision. We must stand firm and put forth a candidate who represents the values of hard work, personal responsibility, and a deep commitment to the future of New York City. The progress we have made in recent elections shows the strength of our movement, and now is not the time to retreat. We must move forward with purpose and determination. I am committed to being the voice of conservatives across all five boroughs. I have already begun conversations with leaders in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, and I look forward to meeting with those in Queens and Staten Island in the days ahead. Together, we will build a united front that reflects the heart and soul of our city—a city that embraces its diversity, honors its history, and faces its challenges with a clear-eyed vision for the future. I am determined to gain the support of county and state party leadership, and to build on the momentum we have already established. We cannot afford to let our party’s influence weaken or miss this critical moment to bring real, lasting change to New York City. If I am elected mayor, I will fully and properly fund the New York Police Department, ensuring that our officers have the resources they need to protect and serve all New Yorkers. I will take a firm stance against crime, focusing on tackling issues like drugs, prostitution, and repeat offenders, and holding criminals accountable for their actions. At the same time, my administration will work hand in hand with community leaders to create a city that is inclusive, safe, and respectful of every New Yorker’s rights. Restoring affordability to New York City is one of my most pressing goals. Achieving this will require not only the full support of my administration but also the collective effort of all New Yorkers. Together, we can begin to tackle the housing crisis, reduce the cost of living, and ensure that our city remains accessible to those who have helped build it.

This is not just a campaign—it is a movement built on the belief that New York City deserves leadership as dynamic and diverse as its people. As a Marine, community leader, and dedicated public servant, I have spent my life fighting for the Bronx, for New York City, and for our country. My commitment to service, leadership, and accountability has prepared me to take on the critical role of Public Advocate and be the voice that New Yorkers deserve. My background, shaped by military service, nonprofit leadership, and hands-on political experience, equips me with the skills to hold city agencies accountable and address the pressing concerns of everyday New Yorkers. New Yorkers are facing serious challenges—crime, rising costs, and a disconnect between leadership and the real needs of our communities. Too often, those in power serve entrenched interests rather than the people. I am stepping up to change that. My mission is to restore trust in government, ensure transparency, and fight for policies that make New York a safer, more livable city for all. As Public Advocate, I will take the fight directly to City Hall—introducing and co-sponsoring legislation, providing critical oversight of city agencies, and ensuring that the voices of all New Yorkers are heard. I will not just listen to complaints about city services—I will act to fix them. My plan prioritizes accountability, transparency, and real solutions that improve the quality of life for every resident. With your support, we will bring real change to City Hall. I invite all New Yorkers to stand with me, to demand better, and to be part of a movement that puts people first. The time for action is now. Let’s make New York City stronger, safer, and more accountable—together. Thank you, and as always, God Bless America.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 15, 2025 Gonzalo Duran (516) 515 – 0240 Gonzalodurannyc@gmail.com Bronx, New York – To my fellow Conservative Party members, it is with deep regret that I inform you the Conservative Party has chosen not to select me as its candidate for Mayor of New York City. While I respect the Party’s decision, I firmly believe this represents a missed opportunity—not just for me, but for the Party and the people we serve. That said, I will not challenge the Party’s chosen candidate. My commitment has always been about fighting for the values we hold dear. I have always believed that leadership is proven through action, and my work is far from over. I will continue doing what I do best—working relentlessly to serve my community, grow our movement, and strengthen our Party from within. When the time comes to stand before Party leadership again, I want there to be no doubt that I am more than ready to take on any role, any challenge, and any fight necessary to advance our shared vision. My next steps will be swift and decisive. This is not the end—it is simply the beginning of a new chapter.

While I respect the Party’s decision, I firmly believe this represents a missed opportunity—not just for me, but for the Party and the people we serve. That said, I will not challenge the Party’s chosen candidate. My commitment has always been about fighting for the values we hold dear. I have always believed that leadership is proven through action, and my work is far from over. I will continue doing what I do best—working relentlessly to serve my community, grow our movement, and strengthen our Party from within. When the time comes to stand before Party leadership again, I want there to be no doubt that I am more than ready to take on any role, any challenge, and any fight necessary to advance our shared vision. My next steps will be swift and decisive. This is not the end—it is simply the beginning of a new chapter. Thank you, and as always, God Bless America. ### Share this: Share Share Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click"
