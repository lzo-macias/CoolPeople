By Dean Chang May 6, 2025 This is The Sprint for City Hall, a limited-run series on the critical Democratic primary race for mayor. In seven weeks, New Yorkers will vote for the Democratic nominee for mayor. We’re not big on public predictions, but you can bet on one thing: The incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams, will not win the primary. He is running as an independent in November and will not be on the June 24 ballot. (More on that in a bit.) That still leaves 11 Democrats in the primary race, and a mountain of policy papers, endorsements, retail politicking and, eventually, two debates, to digest. That’s what we’re here for. I’m Dean Chang, and I oversee a fantastic team of reporters covering the race. Each Tuesday through Primary Day, they’ll be sharing a mix of news, observations, trends and campaign ephemera that might otherwise be overlooked. We’ll start with a quick overview, move to some news, and get to Fran Lebowitz’s ranked choices a bit further down. No surprise: She has thoughts.

SCOTT STRINGER For New York City Mayor Scott’s Letter to New Yorkers My vision for the future of New York City matches yours. My vision of the city is strong, safe communities where people can afford to live, stay, and put down roots. A city that continues to attract people because it’s a place where building a good life isn’t so hard. A city where a New York state of mind and peace of mind are one and the same. Why Scott New York City is broken. Families are being priced out of their homes, crime is shaking the foundation of our neighborhoods, and schools are leaving our children behind. Three years of chaos and pay-to-play politics have eroded the trust New Yorkers once had in City Hall. This isn’t just mismanagement—it’s a betrayal of the compact between the city and its people. Scott Stringer represents a stark contrast: a proven reformer with three decades of experience cleaning up government. He conducted the most in-depth and highest-impact audits of any New York City Comptroller, exposing waste and corruption, saving billions in taxpayer dollars. He's replaced patronage with merit-based hiring. He's held bad actors accountable and delivered billions in savings for taxpayers. Scott’s leadership has shown that we can fix what’s broken and build a city where opportunity thrives. As mayor, Scott will prioritize the most pressing issues facing New Yorkers: affordable housing, public safety, reliable transit, and strong schools. His vision is clear: a city that’s safe, affordable, and thriving—where loving New York doesn’t have to be so hard. This is the time to restore competence, transparency, and trust in City Hall, and Scott is ready to lead the charge. “We’ve fixed big problems before, and we can do it again,” Scott says. “This isn’t the moment for empty promises or on-the-job training.

SCOTT STRINGER For New York City Mayor Scott’s Letter to New Yorkers My vision for the future of New York City matches yours. My vision of the city is strong, safe communities where people can afford to live, stay, and put down roots. A city that continues to attract people because it’s a place where building a good life isn’t so hard. A city where a New York state of mind and peace of mind are one and the same. Why Scott New York City is broken. Families are being priced out of their homes, crime is shaking the foundation of our neighborhoods, and schools are leaving our children behind.

As mayor, Scott will prioritize the most pressing issues facing New Yorkers: affordable housing, public safety, reliable transit, and strong schools.

Courtesy of Scott Stringer By Jacob Kornbluh November 27, 2024 Like any Jewish parents, Scott Stringer and Elyse Buxbaum have been preparing for the bar mitzvah of their elder son, Maxwell Elliot, with a mix of pride and anxiety. In a recent joint interview, Buxbaum described the boy as a “natural leader” among his social set, but said “he’s nervous” about the Dec. 14 milestone. The couple, who do not belong to a synagogue, taught him some Hebrew and have rented a hall in their downtown Manhattan neighborhood for what they described as a “private, intimate” affair. Stringer, 64, was Manhattan borough president when Max was born, then New York City’s comptroller. So he and his 11-year-old brother, Miles, have been in the public eye their entire lives, and appeared in advertisements for their father’s failed mayoral bid in 2021.

Stringer and Buxbaum said Max’s Torah portion, Vayishlach — which centers on the rivalry and reconciliation between the biblical brothers Jacob and Esau — resonates with them as they approach this new campaign trying to move beyond past setbacks and arguments. “I feel like it’s very representative of where we are at this moment,” Buxbaum said in the interview. “Forgiving people for what they might have said or done is essential to make everything better and move ahead.” A second chance?

Courtesy of Scott Stringer By Jacob Kornbluh November 27, 2024 Like any Jewish parents, Scott Stringer and Elyse Buxbaum have been preparing for the bar mitzvah of their elder son, Maxwell Elliot, with a mix of pride and anxiety. In a recent joint interview, Buxbaum described the boy as a “natural leader” among his social set, but said “he’s nervous” about the Dec. 14 milestone. The couple, who do not belong to a synagogue, taught him some Hebrew and have rented a hall in their downtown Manhattan neighborhood for what they described as a “private, intimate” affair. Stringer, 64, was Manhattan borough president when Max was born, then New York City’s comptroller. So he and his 11-year-old brother, Miles, have been in the public eye their entire lives, and appeared in advertisements for their father’s failed mayoral bid in 2021.

Lander leads the field in fundraising, with $1 million raised since January, and Stringer is second at $600,000, according to campaign finance reports . That means both will qualify for up to $2.5 million in public matching funds. Adams’ upcoming corruption trial in April could upend the race. If he resigns, Jumaane Williams , the city’s public advocate who criticized Adams for his crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests , would replace him as acting mayor and could run for a full term.

Andrew Cuomo , who stepped down in 2021 following multiple sexual harassment allegations; Attorney General Letitia James , who gained national fame for prosecuting former President Donald Trump; and Rep. Ritchie Torres , a pro-Israel Democrat from the Bronx. Cuomo and James both touted their pro-Israel bonafides at a Jewish event earlier this week. Jewish voter outreach Scott Stringer on April 26, 2021. Photo by Jacob Kornbluh Jews make up about 20% of the Democratic primary electorate in New York City, with the Orthodox in Brooklyn often voting in blocs based on rabbinic endorsements . In 2021, Adams and Andrew Yang both campaigned fiercely in Haredi neighborhoods, and the mayor attributed his narrow primary victory to their suppor t. Stringer has never resonated strongly with these more conservative Haredi voters, but he would likely rely on support from Jewish voters in the Upper West Side and Brownstone Brooklyn. Related Scott Stringer is used to Jewish support. Will it carry him to City Hall? The question for Stringer, who spent nearly three decades as an elected official starting as an assembly member in 1993, is what kind of candidate he will be, given his fallout with the left last time. He previously had support from some elected officials affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, but was infuriated by the group’s celebration of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, calling them “antisemitic idiots.” “I need to build my new coalition,” Stringer said. Stringer’s views on Israel and the campus protests Scott Stringer, then-Manhattan borough president, and his wife Elyse with their son Max at the Celebrate Israel Parade on June 3, 2012. Photo by Scott M Stringer Stringer has always maintained that he was opposed to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, but said he would not seek to limit any individual’s right to peaceful expression. He said he views his campaign through a different lens because of Oct. 7 and its aftermath. “For the first time as a Jew, I realized that things would never be the same,” he said of watching the news of the assault. He would not go into detail about his views on the war in Gaza or calls for a ceasefire, saying only, “Obviously, I want peace in the Middle East, and the best way to start is by bringing the hostages home.” Some of his opponents, especially Lander and Mamdani, have taken more critical stances on Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza , aligned with pro-Palestinian forces in some of New York’s progressive precincts. On the other side, Adams, Myrie, James and Cuomo have spoken out strongly in defense of Israel. Related New York Democratic Socialists reject censure of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for hosting antisemitism panel In the interview, Stringer was critical of pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses and throughout the city, “They don’t know what ‘river’ or what ‘sea,’” he said, referencing the common chant, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” “I understand that some people just want to be part of a mob, but to the agitators who think they can bully or attack other people — that’s just not going to happen when I’m in charge,” he said. Stringer promised a “zero-tolerance approach” to all forms of hate. “When that protest turns into a riot targeting individuals, that’s when you have to say, enough is enough.” Stringer said he would focus on preventative protocols to ensure that campuses remain safe spaces for students. “After Oct. 7, it’s not just something I’d like to do,” he said. “It’s something that must be done.” Related Opinion: Why all American Jews should care about New York’s mayoral election Jacob Kornbluh is the Forward ’s senior political reporter.
