Protect current stock of affordable housing Reports show that NYC affordable housing saw a net loss of over 150,000 units, over 75% since 2019. In 2023 alone, there was an estimated net loss of over 4,000 rent-stabilized units. Units are being deregulated, often illegally.

Agreements to develop new affordable housing units are great, but they’re worthless if they aren’t enforced. We've seen numerous instances where development with permitted FAR increases under Mandatory Inclusionary Housing didn’t follow through and complete the promised affordable housing, especially when affordable housing was permitted to be off-site. Oversight is essential to tackling the housing challenge and the only way we can that ensure that the new Universal Affordability Preference program will succeed.

Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible 3. Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible The current office vacancy rate in Midtown is 20 percent. Many of these empty spaces must be repurposed as residential housing as we seek to optimize our current spaces alongside the creation of new housing. We can build up to 85,000 new mixed-income units in Midtown Manhattan by increasing allowable density on sites where residential towers are already permitted.

Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible 3. Convert commercial to residential, wherever possible The current office vacancy rate in Midtown is 20 percent. Many of these empty spaces must be repurposed as residential housing as we seek to optimize our current spaces alongside the creation of new housing.

But City of Yes, on its own, is only estimated to result in about 5,000 new units per year across the whole city.

We must be vigilant in ensuring new construction meets affordability targets. For example, what we have seen, including right across the street from my apartment, are tenements with affordable housing being torn down so that towers with a relatively small number of enormous apartments can be built, meaning that even when developers participate in mandatory inclusionary housing and comply with their legal obligations, we end up with fewer affordable units than we had before.

Housing First Housing First We need a long-term, comprehensive approach to permanent housing and mental health care for low-income New Yorkers. I support Housing First policies that prioritize providing permanent housing without preconditions, a proven, cost-effective strategy used successfully in countries like Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Japan.

Improving Homeless Services Through Coordinated Data Systems Improving Homeless Services Through Coordinated Data Systems Roughly 2,500 unsheltered individuals regularly interact with City services, from law enforcement to hospitals to nonprofits. Yet outdated technology means these systems can’t share vital information. As a result, outreach workers and first responders often engage with people without knowing their history or existing supports. By integrating these systems—with strong privacy protections—we can make interventions safer, more effective, and more humane.

I’m fighting to stop the closure of Mount Sinai Beth Israel and protect the 153 behavioral health beds at risk. I also support Borough President Mark Levine’s push to expand the Transition to Home program at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center, which could serve far more patients than it currently does. Additionally, I back his proposal for student loan forgiveness to help recruit and retain psychiatric care professionals at NYC Health + Hospitals.

I support Housing First policies that prioritize providing permanent housing without preconditions, a proven, cost-effective strategy used successfully in countries like Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Japan. This approach helps prevent recurring homelessness and addresses root causes early. We need a long-term, comprehensive approach to permanent housing and mental health care for low-income New Yorkers.

Expand Hate Crimes Training to Prosecutors and Judges 2. Expand Hate Crimes Training to Prosecutors and Judges In addition to training for law enforcement, prosecutors and judges should be required to undergo specialized training for how to identify and investigate possible hate crimes. Prosecutors should be trained to thoroughly examine the possibility that racial, homophobic or other hatred may have been a motivating factor in an attack, to order further investigative steps where necessary, and to put hate motivation forward as a factor in sentencing where appropriate. Judges should receive further training on how to identify and assess relevant evidence of hate motivation, and when to take it into account.

With these defunding efforts, it becomes even more critical to ensure the continued existence and growth of organizations that offer vital services to victims. These services—free-of-charge, confidential, pro-victim, and voluntary—are essential for those in need, particularly when they prefer to remain anonymous. Organizations like Safe Horizon provide crucial emotional support, information on legal options, guidance on financial assistance, and help with public relations. Additionally, they play a key role in accompanying victims to the police station or court, offering a sense of safety and advocacy. In a time when resources are shrinking, it is vital that we prioritize and strengthen these services, not diminish them, to ensure all victims in our community have access to the support they deserve.

[5] The following sections display her responses to the survey questions. When asked what her top priority would be if elected, the candidate made the following statement: “ Whether at school talking with parents or in the community chatting with neighbors, I'm hearing the same story: our vibrant neighborhoods are disappearing. Families and seniors are being priced out of the city because there isn't enough affordable housing, mom and pops are shutting down, transportation is increasingly unreliable and inaccessible, and for those who do manage to afford to stay in the city, our schools are overcrowded and underfunded. I will work to make New York more affordable, supporting tenants and small businesses. In the face of federal cuts, I will protect public funding for housing, schools and healthcare. I will hold the MTA accountable for improving services for all, including people with disabilities. I will ensure bicyclists, vehicles, and pedestrians safely share our streets. As a former teacher, I will be a strong advocate for all students, including those with special needs, and the hardworking teachers across our city. I will use my policy training and experience to stand up for New York and the East Side.

The questions are in the left column and the candidate's responses are in the right column. Some questions provided multiple choices, which are noted after those questions. Is it important for the city’s budget to be balanced? Answer options: Not important; Not important, but required by state law; A little important; A little important, but required by state law; Important; Very important Important Which level of government do you feel should set a minimum wage? Answer options: None, Local, State, Federal Local How do you think your city should emphasize economic development? Candidates could write their own answer or choose from the following options: Changing zoning restrictions, Create a more competitive business climate, Focusing on small business development, Instituting a citywide minimum wage, Recruiting new businesses to your city, Regulatory and licensing reforms, and tax reform Focusing on small business development. First and foremost, we need to ensure that there are no financial incentives to landlords who inflate their rents and keep their spaces vacant. I will fight to remove any and all such tax breaks for landlords with persistent vacancies lasting over one year. An additional carrot to incentivize landlords to fill vacant spaces would be to explore possible tax deductions to those who take a risk on renting shorter-term leases to first-time small businesses and pop-up shops. Second, I advocate for following in the footsteps of San Francisco, a similarly expensive city but one which boasts the lowest retail vacancy rates in the country, to implement two policies: the creation of Business Legacy Registry, which would track and maintain a public registry of small businesses that have been in New York City for at least 30 years, and the introduction of formula retail zoning restrictions to limit the number of chain stores lining our streets. Third, I agree with the numerous local elected officials and policy experts who advocate for the full elimination of the Commercial Rent Tax.

What is the one thing you’re most proud of about your city? I'm proud of the way that New Yorkers come together to protect and help one another. What is the one thing you’d most like to change about your city? The increasing influence of lobbyists, particularly on behalf of business and real estate interests, on city government is continuing to increase each year. Lobbyists in New York City have raked in record earnings in the past decade and the number of hours per week City officials spend meeting with lobbyists also keeps rising. A number of steps can be taken to bring more transparency to the lobbying process and decrease the influence of big money in government. First, the City Council should disclose lobbying meetings, just as they disclose monetary contributions, so that the public can judge what influence lobbyists have on the actions of the Council. Second, lobbyists should be required to disclose not only their client list, but also the elected officials with whom, as well as the legislation about which, they are meeting. Finally, in New York City, former elected officials are currently prohibited from any lobbying of their branch of government for one year after leaving government, with many good governance advocates pushing to increase the moratorium to two years. What is not restricted, however, is current lobbyists seeking elected positions in government. That means that individuals currently accepting money to influence policy on behalf of special interests can soon thereafter be at the helm of government themselves. This type of trajectory needs to be taken seriously and monitored closely by government watchdog organizations and constituents alike. Do you approve of the city's approach to policing and public safety? What changes, if any, do you think the city should make? I support the Public Oversight of Technology (POST) Act, which was introduced by Council Members Dan Garodnick and Vanessa L. Gibson and is currently laid over in committee. In short, the POST Act requires the NYPD to develop impact studies and use policies about its surveillance technology -- much like what’s already done by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security for tools like facial recognition software, drones, and stingrays, (fake cell towers that collect sensitive location and communications data). According to Council Member Dan Garodnick, the POST Act would provide New York City lawmakers with 'a meaningful opportunity to understand and oversee decisions about the NYPD’s acquisition and use of new surveillance technologies and provides an opportunity for public engagement.' The Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy institute that seeks to improve our systems of democracy and justice, states that the POST act is 'a thoughtful approach to balancing the need for democratic oversight and transparency with the NYPD’s legitimate need for operational secrecy.'

Do you approve of the city's sanctuary policy? What changes, if any, do you think the city should make? In the face of anti-immigrant policies, undocumented New Yorkers’ last line of defense is often an attorney. Only three percent of those who are detained and facing deportation receive favorable outcomes in their cases, but individuals who have a lawyer are six times more likely to prevail in a case, according to a 2010 study conducted by the Study Group on Immigrant Representation convened by Judge Robert Katzmann of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. New York has shown leadership in securing counsel with its Immigrant Family Unity Project, which provides lawyers to low-income people in immigration detention. In its current iteration,"

Do you approve of the city's approach to public transportation? What changes, if any, do you think the city should make? My vision for transportation in NYC is that all residents have access to safe, reliable, and accessible transportation options. People using wheelchairs and walkers, as well as parents with strollers, should be able to access all aspects of city life, and all New Yorkers should be able to rely on a safe and efficient transportation system. I have been a fierce advocate for accessible transportation in NYC. Currently, the city is falling far behind, with less than 25% of subway stops accessible to people with ambulatory disabilities. Access-a-ride, the CIty’s stopgap to the out-of-date system, is inefficient and unreliable. Since well before the “Summer of Hell” transportation crisis began, I have also been demanding that our state and local officials practice leadership and start holding the MTA accountable for maintaining and updating its aging infrastructure. Billions of dollars from the City to the MTA Capital Plan are being spent irresponsibly, without oversight. When the L train closes in 481 days, I envision a dynamic 14th street PeopleWay with a wide pedestrian promenade, ample space for bicycles, and a free, efficient shuttle bus running across Manhattan, safely and reliably delivering commuters to their next subway or bus connection. Do you approve of the city's approach to housing policy? What changes, if any, do you think the city should make? First, I will preserve and protect the current dwindling stock of affordable housing units. To do so will first require an accurate audit of existing rent-regulated apartments as well as all units that have been deregulated within the past five years. This must be done to ensure that landlords who receive J-51 and other tax benefits are not illegally deregulating units. Additionally, I applaud the recent mayoral plan to grant low-income tenants free legal representation in housing court to prevent unlawful evictions of tenants from their rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. As a City Council Member, I will fight to make sure funds are appropriated to administer this legal program, guaranteeing this right to counsel is not just granted in theory, but is also put into practice. Second, I will fight to the repeal the Urstadt Law, which wrongly denies New York City home rule on critical housing issues. There is no legitimate reason why the City of New York should not legislate on a matter specifically concerning its citizens. Finally, while I support pro-growth policies that allow for additional residential development, I will not support any development plans that do not also adequately address the following: 1) neighborhood schools have sufficient class space to accommodate an increase in population density without displacing children of current residents; 2) occupancy rates remain high, so that additional housing stock is not simply absorbed into the non-resident, pied-a-terre market; and, 3) a sufficient number of units are available at prices that middle-class tenants can afford.

Since well before the “Summer of Hell” transportation crisis began, I have also been demanding that our state and local officials practice leadership and start holding the MTA accountable for maintaining and updating its aging infrastructure. Billions of dollars from the City to the MTA Capital Plan are being spent irresponsibly, without oversight. When the L train closes in 481 days, I envision a dynamic 14th street PeopleWay with a wide pedestrian promenade, ample space for bicycles, and a free, efficient shuttle bus running across Manhattan, safely and reliably delivering commuters to their next subway or bus connection. Do you approve of the city's approach to housing policy? What changes, if any, do you think the city should make? First, I will preserve and protect the current dwindling stock of affordable housing units. To do so will first require an accurate audit of existing rent-regulated apartments as well as all units that have been deregulated within the past five years. This must be done to ensure that landlords who receive J-51 and other tax benefits are not illegally deregulating units. Additionally, I applaud the recent mayoral plan to grant low-income tenants free legal representation in housing court to prevent unlawful evictions of tenants from their rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. As a City Council Member, I will fight to make sure funds are appropriated to administer this legal program, guaranteeing this right to counsel is not just granted in theory, but is also put into practice. Second, I will fight to the repeal the Urstadt Law, which wrongly denies New York City home rule on critical housing issues. There is no legitimate reason why the City of New York should not legislate on a matter specifically concerning its citizens. Finally, while I support pro-growth policies that allow for additional residential development, I will not support any development plans that do not also adequately address the following: 1) neighborhood schools have sufficient class space to accommodate an increase in population density without displacing children of current residents; 2) occupancy rates remain high, so that additional housing stock is not simply absorbed into the non-resident, pied-a-terre market; and, 3) a sufficient number of units are available at prices that middle-class tenants can afford.

Follow through on the City Housing Authority’s 20-year old plan to make thousands of apartments fully wheelchair accessible. Prioritize the installation of pedestrian ramps and the maintenance and repair of the existing ramps. Install pedestrian countdown timers at dangerous intersections in the city. SCHOOLS As a former New York City public school teacher, I know our youngest New Yorkers are bright, energetic, and full of promise. Our education system should do everything it can to give all students the opportunities they deserve to reach their full potential. As Council Member, I will work to:Expand school enrichment programs, such as art, music, or coding, to increase engagement and cultivate critical skills. Support the Lunch4Learning program to provide free and healthy school lunch for all. Prioritize Special Education services for both students with special needs and gifted and talented students so that New York City is in compliance with federal law... Extend the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline programs to include 6th– 12th grades. Increase training for educators in non-exclusionary discipline methods, such as through the Positive Learning Collaborative, to decrease suspensions that only leave at-risk students further behind. Increase Teacher's Choice funding, which reimburses teachers for a portion of what they spend out of pocket on classroom supplies. Make mayoral control permanent. There is widespread agreement that mayoral control is good for New York City’s schools. And yet every year or two, this policy is used for political leverage in Albany. The state legislature should make mayoral control permanent, with robust community engagement measures put in place. I believe the Mayor should be able to make long-term decisions when it comes to NYC schools. And it will be my job as Council Member to hold the Mayor accountable for those decisions. SENIORS By 2040, seniors will make up 1 in 5 people. The needs of this fast-growing population warrant robust initiatives to make sure that New Yorkers remain healthy, active, and engaged with their communities as they age. Involve older adults in the policy planning process about their own health and social services. Increase access to mental health services for isolated seniors by supporting tele-health video-counseling. Invest in job training, technology training, and placement for seniors through 'age-smart employment' practices to value and retain older workers. Expand access, availability, and information about city parks and recreation resources for older adults. Strengthen and broaden systems to detect financial fraud and abuse. IMMIGRANTS As a diplomat I learned firsthand the importance of a strong legal framework to protect immigrants.

To protect our immigrant neighbors, New York City must: Put forth legislation that protects an immigrant’s right to an attorney to represent them in deportation proceedings.

Prioritize Special Education services for both students with special needs and gifted and talented students so that New York City is in compliance with federal law... Extend the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline programs to include 6th– 12th grades. Increase training for educators in non-exclusionary discipline methods, such as through the Positive Learning Collaborative, to decrease suspensions that only leave at-risk students further behind. Increase Teacher's Choice funding, which reimburses teachers for a portion of what they spend out of pocket on classroom supplies. Make mayoral control permanent. There is widespread agreement that mayoral control is good for New York City’s schools. And yet every year or two, this policy is used for political leverage in Albany. The state legislature should make mayoral control permanent, with robust community engagement measures put in place. I believe the Mayor should be able to make long-term decisions when it comes to NYC schools. And it will be my job as Council Member to hold the Mayor accountable for those decisions. SENIORS By 2040, seniors will make up 1 in 5 people. The needs of this fast-growing population warrant robust initiatives to make sure that New Yorkers remain healthy, active, and engaged with their communities as they age. Involve older adults in the policy planning process about their own health and social services. Increase access to mental health services for isolated seniors by supporting tele-health video-counseling. Invest in job training, technology training, and placement for seniors through 'age-smart employment' practices to value and retain older workers. Expand access, availability, and information about city parks and recreation"

NYC students should have access to comprehensive, age-appropriate sexual health education so that they can make healthy decisions. All women in New York, regardless of income, race, or ethnicity, should have access to reproductive health care. Maternal mortality should not be dependent on zip code or race and ethnicity. [6] AFFORDABILITY, INCLUDING HOUSING We live in an amazing city, but with the high cost of rent and tenants’ rights at risk, many families lack the stability needed to fully engage in their communities and invest in their future. We must make sure that housing is affordable... New York City must: Preserve current affordable housing stocks, including rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units, to the full extent provided by current law. Support the creation of additional affordable housing stocks by working with non-profit and other developers who will make affordable housing a priority. Repeal Urstadt. Work with our City’s representatives in State Government to repeal the Urstadt Law and restore New York City’s home rule. QUALITY OF LIFE We’ve got some major quality of life challenges in the 4th Council District. The Lexington Avenue Subway line is the most crowded in New York, and East Side Access will make it worse. The Second Avenue Subway is open – at long last – but many local businesses have not recovered. We rank dead-last among Council districts when it comes to park space per resident. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, RELIABILITY AND ACCESSIBILTY When I was a teacher, one of my students used a wheelchair and spent three hours each day commuting from home to school because there are so few accessible schools near subway stations with elevators... New York should not turn its back on people with disabilities, seniors with mobility issues, or parents with strollers. New York City must: Demand that the City's contribution to the MTA capital plan includes funds earmarked to update the more than 75% of subway stations that currently do not have elevators so they are accessible to everyone. Ensure the Metropolitan Transit Authority immediately lists elevator outages on their website and makes intercom announcements in stations. Follow through on the City Housing Authority’s 20-year old plan to make thousands of apartments fully wheelchair accessible. Prioritize the installation of pedestrian ramps and the maintenance and repair of the existing ramps. Install pedestrian countdown timers at dangerous intersections in the city. SCHOOLS As a former New York City public school teacher, I know our youngest New Yorkers are bright, energetic, and full of promise. Our education system should do everything it can to give all students the opportunities they deserve to reach their full potential.
