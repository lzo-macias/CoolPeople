Having grown up with zero ties to the STEM industry, I was overwhelmed to enter college and find folks around me coming in with high school internships, years of coding experience, parent mentors in big tech/positions of power, etc. However, I am blessed to have found mentors in college that really changed my life. They showed me ropes that I didn’t know existed, took risks on me that I didn’t think I deserved, and taught me what kind of person I wanted to become. These were the people that helped me grow and convinced me that yes, I belong here. Seeing how big an impact my mentors made on my life, I wish to do the same for others, especially those who can relate with my struggles. By giving back to the community, I aim to inspire and help others like how my mentors did for me. Our industry collaborations included folks from Microsoft, Qualcomm, F5, Instagram, TikTok, and more. Here are some photos of past events: Activity/Talks (11/2022) Presented at poster session for the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana (10/2022) Presented at poster session for the Institute for Learning-Enabled Optimization at Scale (TILOS) 2022 in La Jolla Shores"

    "text": "/ / About Me I am currently enrolled at the University College of London (UCL) for a Masters of Science in Software Systems Engineering. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Creative Juice . Education and Research I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I worked with Dr. Chris Myers at the Genetic Logic Lab during my undergraduate studies. My focuses included large scale genetic data repositories and search methods for genetic sequences.
