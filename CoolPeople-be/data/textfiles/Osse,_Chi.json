Here in the office of City Council District 36, we are proud to have built a team of highly-capable people from diverse backgrounds who are committed to the job and to our constituents. Feel free to reach out and get to know us! Chief of Staff Arlean Gillin directs all that happens within New York City Council District 36. Everything from constituent services to community events to our world-famous Wellness Wednesday Program falls under her purview. How does she handle this portfolio without succumbing to exhaustion? She draws energy directly from the electric buzz of our Brooklyn blocks. And she is a superhero. She can be reached at AGillin@council.nyc.gov Director of Policy and Budget May Vutrapongvatana is a lawyer, a boxer, and legislative wizard — a true triple-threat. She is responsible for the legislative side of our office: developing and passing laws and designing the budget.

He can be reached at EFox@council.nyc.gov District Manager and Scheduler Tasheika Gordon is responsible for all that happens within our district, as well as managing our complex calendar. Constituents bring in a wide range of cases, from seeking affordable housing to dealing with City agencies. Tasheika handles them all with sharp conviction and tireless grace.
