We deserve a city where every New Yorker, from every neighborhood, has the opportunity to thrive. Sarah understands that bold, systemic changes are needed—starting with policies that put people first. From expanding access to healthcare to creating affordable housing to ensuring our schools serve every student equally, the work ahead demands prioritizing care and equity in every decision. With Sarah as City Council Member, we can build a New York City that truly cares for everyone. Healthcare Sarah is a public health expert and a fierce advocate for quality, affordable healthcare for all New Yorkers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she launched Get Help NYC, the city’s central online resource hub connecting thousands to essential services. After earning her Master’s in Public Health from Columbia University, she helped establish the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness, a community space focused on addressing health disparities on the Lower East Side. Sarah fought on the frontlines to keep Mount Sinai Beth Israel open—successfully delaying its closure by a year—and continues to lead the fight for a full-service replacement. She’s committed to ensuring every New Yorker has access to the care they need and deserve, right in their own neighborhood. As Council Member, Sarah will: Demand a Real Replacement for Beth Israel Hospital : Push State and City officials to deliver a full-scale replacement hospital in our district after the closure of Mount Sinai Beth Israel—not just urgent care. Ensure our district has real hospital beds, emergency services, mental health care, and accessible primary care that meets the needs of Lower Manhattan. Expand Mental Health Services : Increase access to free and low-cost counseling, therapy, and virtual services offered through NYC Health & Hospitals (H+H). Advocate for expansion of in-patient services through heavy investment in Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) beds and the deployment of crisis intervention teams. Prioritize Accessibility : Improve healthcare access for people with disabilities by protecting New York Eye and Ear Infirmary from closure and by increasing funding for transportation and full ADA compliance in healthcare facilities. Pass a New Deal for NYC Health + Hospitals : Ensure every New Yorker has access to high-quality care when they need it by expanding access through NYC Care and MetroPlus, tackling nursing shortages through partnerships with City University of New York (CUNY) and labor, and addressing the H+H system’s capital needs. Preserve Traditional Medicare for City Retirees : Protect the healthcare benefits of retired City workers by opposing the transition to privately managed Medicare Advantage plans. Protect the healthcare benefits of retired City workers by opposing the transition to privately managed Medicare Advantage plans. Community Safety and Quality of Life Sarah understands that true community safety includes but also goes beyond law enforcement—it’s about addressing the root causes of crime, mental health challenges, and quality of life issues that affect our neighborhoods. Throughout her career, Sarah has worked on programs that empower communities, promote prevention, and tackle the systemic inequities that drive crime and instability. As a former local community center director, Sarah has been a champion for policies that prioritize care and equity, believing that the health and safety of our city depends on the wellbeing of every New Yorker.

She’s running to transform New York City into a place where everyone can feel safe and cared for. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. Sarah was born into a family with a lifelong dedication to the betterment and wellbeing of her community. The daughter of two physicians, she was raised to understand the importance and powerful impact of caring for others. From an early age, she believed that service was not just a value but a way of life. As a student at Barnard College, Sarah’s commitment to service deepened even further as she responded to the movement around campus sexual assault. As a survivor, Sarah intimately understood the toll that a lack of safety could take on the mind and body. With the guidance of fellow survivors and community activists across the city, she transformed her own pain into an ongoing commitment to building a safer city for all—and has had a results-driven career in public service ever since. From the earliest days of her career in New York City government at City Hall, Sarah began tackling the big issues head-on—like addressing the city’s crumbling public housing infrastructure and planning an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In just a few short years, Sarah’s dedication and tenacity yielded remarkable, proven results for thousands of New Yorkers: Sarah raised millions to build innovative public programs serving New Yorkers from all walks of life, including women , immigrants , and people with disabilities . Sarah successfully advocated for reforms to increase access to safe and affordable housing for formerly justice-involved New Yorkers. Sarah designed, launched, and managed Get Help NYC, a groundbreaking online platform that became the city’s primary resource hub during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sarah worked directly with public housing residents to enshrine their rights into law and to give them a voice in the renovation of their homes. Sarah raised over $7 million in rental assistance for tenants facing COVID-19-related financial hardship, ensuring housing stability for undocumented New Yorkers and gig workers left out of State and Federal programs. Following her successful time at City Hall, Sarah joined the Lower Eastside Girls Club as Chief of Staff and was part of the leadership team that launched the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness , an intergenerational community space dedicated to transforming self-care into community care. Within two years, Sarah and her neighbors brought this vision to life, creating a thriving space with over 1,000 members on the Lower East Side. Sarah’s personal and professional experience continues to reinforce her mission to lead in the creation of healing spaces and supportive communities. And, above all, Sarah remains firmly rooted in her belief that all New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in their communities and in the best city in the world. 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 174 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009 team@sarahbatchu.nyc team@sarahbatchu.nyc (‪347) 620-1238‬ (‪347) 620-1238‬ Facebook-f Facebook-f Twitter Twitter Linkedin-in Linkedin-in Instagram Instagram Paid For By Batchu For Council Loading Comments..."

The Murray Hill Neighborhood Association reached out to all the candidates running for office in 2025 that intersect our neighborhood (Mayor, Manhattan Borough President, City Council District 2, and City Council District 4, etc.) with questions sourced directly from our members via our Ask the Candidates questionnaire . See the candidate’s answers below. How you would improve our streets and quality of life? Improving our streets and quality of life requires a thoughtful and balanced approach, one that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions. Our neighborhoods face real challenges—individuals who need support to stabilize their lives, alongside residents who are understandably concerned about safety due to issues like public drug use, harassment, and violent crime. As a public servant, I understand that with the resources we already have, we can make our neighborhoods safer and cleaner. Every city agency must work together to address these concerns. When necessary, law enforcement can play a role, especially in high-need areas, to ensure public safety laws are enforced. However, law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. I’ve seen firsthand how effective collaboration can bring about meaningful change. While working in City Hall, I witnessed how a coordinated task force—bringing together agencies like the Department of Sanitation and the Department of Health—helped tackle quality of life challenges on 125th Street. This type of coordinated effort is what our neighborhoods need, and as your Council Member, I will bring all relevant agencies to the table to ensure we’re making real progress. At the same time, we must address the root causes of these issues. Enforcement alone won’t solve everything—if it could, the city’s current approach would have already fixed these problems. That’s why we need a comprehensive strategy that includes not only public safety measures but also investments in housing, mental health services, education, and job opportunities. By tackling the root causes of homelessness, crime, and public health issues, we can create lasting change that improves the lives of all our residents. How are you going to handle the illegal migrant situation that has escalated into NYC? New York City has always been a city of immigrants, and our district has a proud history of welcoming new neighbors while ensuring long-term residents can continue to thrive. But right now, federal inaction on immigration has left New York City to deal with a crisis without the necessary resources. The mayor’s mismanagement has only made things worse—wasting taxpayer dollars on ineffective policies instead of investing in real solutions that benefit everyone. The biggest strain has been on housing, and unfortunately, the mayor has taken an approach that is both unsustainable and fiscally irresponsible. Instead of prioritizing cost-effective, permanent housing solutions, his administration has relied on high-priced shelter providers charging nearly $400 per night—when rental assistance costs less than $80 per night. At the same time, his 30-day and 60-day shelter eviction rules are making our neighborhoods less safe by forcing more people onto the streets. These policies don’t just fail new arrivals—they fail all of us, driving up costs and making our homelessness crisis worse. As your Council Member, I will fight for policies that keep our neighborhoods stable and livable. That means ending these wasteful eviction policies and redirecting funds toward real housing solutions that work for both longtime residents and new arrivals, including strengthening rental assistance and expanding affordable housing. Of course, housing stability is tied to economic opportunity. Right now, the city’s bureaucracy is preventing asylum seekers from working legally, which only increases the burden on our social services. I will push the city to cut red tape and expand work authorization so that new migrants can contribute to our economy, as many would like to do. Beyond housing and jobs, true integration requires strong community networks. I will work alongside local organizations to ensure that new arrivals have the tools to succeed. That means expanding legal aid to help immigrants navigate their status and ensuring that our schools, hospitals, and public spaces are safe spaces for all to seek support. When the city takes a smart, coordinated approach, we can prevent the chaos we see now and build a district where longtime residents and new arrivals alike feel safe, supported, and secure—that’s the leadership I will bring to the Council.

The Murray Hill Neighborhood Association reached out to all the candidates running for office in 2025 that intersect our neighborhood (Mayor, Manhattan Borough President, City Council District 2, and City Council District 4, etc.) with questions sourced directly from our members via our Ask the Candidates questionnaire . See the candidate’s answers below. How you would improve our streets and quality of life? Improving our streets and quality of life requires a thoughtful and balanced approach, one that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions. Our neighborhoods face real challenges—individuals who need support to stabilize their lives, alongside residents who are understandably concerned about safety due to issues like public drug use, harassment, and violent crime. As a public servant, I understand that with the resources we already have, we can make our neighborhoods safer and cleaner. Every city agency must work together to address these concerns. When necessary, law enforcement can play a role, especially in high-need areas, to ensure public safety laws are enforced. However, law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. I’ve seen firsthand how effective collaboration can bring about meaningful change. While working in City Hall, I witnessed how a coordinated task force—bringing together agencies like the Department of Sanitation and the Department of Health—helped tackle quality of life challenges on 125th Street. This type of coordinated effort is what our neighborhoods need, and as your Council Member, I will bring all relevant agencies to the table to ensure we’re making real progress. At the same time, we must address the root causes of these issues. Enforcement alone won’t solve everything—if it could, the city’s current approach would have already fixed these problems. That’s why we need a comprehensive strategy that includes not only public safety measures but also investments in housing, mental health services, education, and job opportunities. By tackling the root causes of homelessness, crime, and public health issues, we can create lasting change that improves the lives of all our residents. How are you going to handle the illegal migrant situation that has escalated into NYC? New York City has always been a city of immigrants, and our district has a proud history of welcoming new neighbors while ensuring long-term residents can continue to thrive. But right now, federal inaction on immigration has left New York City to deal with a crisis without the necessary resources. The mayor’s mismanagement has only made things worse—wasting taxpayer dollars on ineffective policies instead of investing in real solutions that benefit everyone. The biggest strain has been on housing, and unfortunately, the mayor has taken an approach that is both unsustainable and fiscally irresponsible. Instead of prioritizing cost-effective, permanent housing solutions, his administration has relied on high-priced shelter providers charging nearly $400 per night—when rental assistance costs less than $80 per night. At the same time, his 30-day and 60-day shelter eviction rules are making our neighborhoods less safe by forcing more people onto the streets. These policies don’t just fail new arrivals—they fail all of us, driving up costs and making our homelessness crisis worse. As your Council Member, I will fight for policies that keep our neighborhoods stable and livable. That means ending these wasteful eviction policies and redirecting funds toward real housing solutions that work for both longtime residents and new arrivals, including strengthening rental assistance and expanding affordable housing. Of course, housing stability is tied to economic opportunity.

In neighborhoods where homelessness and mental health struggles are a visible and growing challenge, the strain on the community is undeniable. It’s not just about seeing people in crisis—it’s about the real effects it has on our streets, our safety, and our overall sense of well-being. The issues of homelessness and mental illness require urgent, thoughtful action that acknowledges the unique needs of these communities. The immediate priority must be providing stable, permanent housing for those who are homeless. A Housing First approach offers individuals immediate access to housing, which is essential to their recovery and ability to rebuild their lives. For neighborhoods grappling with rising homelessness, this means expanding affordable housing options and supporting initiatives like rental assistance and rapid rehousing programs. When people are no longer living on the streets or in shelters, it reduces the visibility of the crisis in public spaces and allows neighborhoods to begin healing. However, housing alone isn’t a solution if we don’t address the interconnected issue of mental health. Many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in our neighborhoods also struggle with untreated mental health conditions, which can make their situation even more difficult. Over the years, New York City has seen the closure of numerous inpatient psychiatric beds, leaving fewer options for people in crisis. With local hospitals like Beth Israel closing, people who need urgent psychiatric care have nowhere to go. I will fight for more emergency care beds and advocate for increasing state investments to ensure that individuals experiencing mental health crises have a safe place to turn for help. But we can’t stop there. We need a system that ensures individuals transitioning out of care are not left without housing or support services.

Improving our streets and quality of life requires a thoughtful and balanced approach, one that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions. Our neighborhoods face real challenges—individuals who need support to stabilize their lives, alongside residents who are understandably concerned about safety due to issues like public drug use, harassment, and violent crime. As a public servant, I understand that with the resources we already have, we can make our neighborhoods safer and cleaner. Every city agency must work together to address these concerns. When necessary, law enforcement can play a role, especially in high-need areas, to ensure public safety laws are enforced. However, law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. I’ve seen firsthand how effective collaboration can bring about meaningful change.

As a community advocate, I recognize that neighborhood associations like the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association (MHNA) are the foundation of a thriving community. As Council Member, I am committed to being actively involved with MHNA by regularly attending meetings and engaging with residents to stay informed about the challenges they face. By maintaining a consistent presence in the community, I will ensure that I have my ear to the ground and can effectively advocate for the needs of Murray Hill residents. In addition to direct engagement, I will work to secure discretionary funding from the City to support MHNA and its local initiatives sustainably. These funds will be vital in enhancing community projects, strengthening local programs, and addressing pressing neighborhood issues.

Bio I am a public servant and community health leader running for City Council because I believe New York City deserves more than business-as-usual politics—it needs leaders who truly care about the people. At a time when the city is grappling with rising rents, the disappearance of affordable housing, shuttered hospitals, and families being displaced from neighborhoods they have called home for generations, I am committed to bringing change. Raised in a family deeply rooted in service, my father, an immigrant from India, and my mother, the granddaughter of Jewish refugees, dedicated their lives to providing medical care to their community. Their commitment to dignity, compassion, and community shaped my values and inspired my career. From the earliest days of my career in New York City government at City Hall, I began tackling big issues head-on—like addressing the city’s crumbling public housing infrastructure and planning an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following my successful time at City Hall, I joined the Lower Eastside Girls Club as Chief of Staff and was part of the leadership team that launched the Center for Wellbeing & Happiness, an intergenerational community space dedicated to transforming self-care into community care.

The Murray Hill Neighborhood Association reached out to all the candidates running for office in 2025 that intersect our neighborhood (Mayor, Manhattan Borough President, City Council District 2, and City Council District 4, etc.) with questions sourced directly from our members via our Ask the Candidates questionnaire . See the candidate’s answers below. How you would improve our streets and quality of life? Improving our streets and quality of life requires a thoughtful and balanced approach, one that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions. Our neighborhoods face real challenges—individuals who need support to stabilize their lives, alongside residents who are understandably concerned about safety due to issues like public drug use, harassment, and violent crime. As a public servant, I understand that with the resources we already have, we can make our neighborhoods safer and cleaner. Every city agency must work together to address these concerns. When necessary, law enforcement can play a role, especially in high-need areas, to ensure public safety laws are enforced. However, law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. I’ve seen firsthand how effective collaboration can bring about meaningful change. While working in City Hall, I witnessed how a coordinated task force—bringing together agencies like the Department of Sanitation and the Department of Health—helped tackle quality of life challenges on 125th Street.

But right now, federal inaction on immigration has left New York City to deal with a crisis without the necessary resources. The mayor’s mismanagement has only made things worse—wasting taxpayer dollars on ineffective policies instead of investing in real solutions that benefit everyone. The biggest strain has been on housing, and unfortunately, the mayor has taken an approach that is both unsustainable and fiscally irresponsible. Instead of prioritizing cost-effective, permanent housing solutions, his administration has relied on high-priced shelter providers charging nearly $400 per night—when rental assistance costs less than $80 per night. At the same time, his 30-day and 60-day shelter eviction rules are making our neighborhoods less safe by forcing more people onto the streets.

Right now, New York City is facing a housing shortage, record low vacancy rates, and sky high rents. We need new housing units at all income levels if we want to decrease rents for everyone.

In neighborhoods where homelessness and mental health struggles are a visible and growing challenge, the strain on the community is undeniable. It’s not just about seeing people in crisis—it’s about the real effects it has on our streets, our safety, and our overall sense of well-being. The issues of homelessness and mental illness require urgent, thoughtful action that acknowledges the unique needs of these communities. The immediate priority must be providing stable, permanent housing for those who are homeless. A Housing First approach offers individuals immediate access to housing, which is essential to their recovery and ability to rebuild their lives. For neighborhoods grappling with rising homelessness, this means expanding affordable housing options and supporting initiatives like rental assistance and rapid rehousing programs. When people are no longer living on the streets or in shelters, it reduces the visibility of the crisis in public spaces and allows neighborhoods to begin healing. However, housing alone isn’t a solution if we don’t address the interconnected issue of mental health. Many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in our neighborhoods also struggle with untreated mental health conditions, which can make their situation even more difficult. Over the years, New York City has seen the closure of numerous inpatient psychiatric beds, leaving fewer options for people in crisis. With local hospitals like Beth Israel closing, people who need urgent psychiatric care have nowhere to go. I will fight for more emergency care beds and advocate for increasing state investments to ensure that individuals experiencing mental health crises have a safe place to turn for help. But we can’t stop there. We need a system that ensures individuals transitioning out of care are not left without housing or support services. The lack of follow-up care after a mental health crisis is one of the reasons people end up back on the streets. A comprehensive solution means pairing housing with mental health services, substance abuse treatment, job training, and other essential resources. It’s about creating a system of support that stays with people, helping them stay stable in the long term. For neighbors living in areas with visible homelessness and mental health challenges, this isn’t just a political issue—it’s a daily reality. It’s about feeling safe in your community and knowing that people who are struggling are receiving the help they need to recover and reintegrate. With a comprehensive, compassionate approach, we can provide solutions that benefit both those experiencing homelessness and the broader community. By investing in both housing and mental health services, we can create neighborhoods that are safer, more stable, and more supportive for everyone. How would you support the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association? As a community advocate, I recognize that neighborhood associations like the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association (MHNA) are the foundation of a thriving community.

By maintaining a consistent presence in the community, I will ensure that I have my ear to the ground and can effectively advocate for the needs of Murray Hill residents. In addition to direct engagement, I will work to secure discretionary funding from the City to support MHNA and its local initiatives sustainably. These funds will be vital in enhancing community projects, strengthening local programs, and addressing pressing neighborhood issues. I will prioritize an open, ongoing feedback loop between my office and MHNA leadership, ensuring I am always up to date on residents’ concerns.

Many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in our neighborhoods also struggle with untreated mental health conditions, which can make their situation even more difficult. Over the years, New York City has seen the closure of numerous inpatient psychiatric beds, leaving fewer options for people in crisis. With local hospitals like Beth Israel closing, people who need urgent psychiatric care have nowhere to go. I will fight for more emergency care beds and advocate for increasing state investments to ensure that individuals experiencing mental health crises have a safe place to turn for help. But we can’t stop there. We need a system that ensures individuals transitioning out of care are not left without housing or support services. The lack of follow-up care after a mental health crisis is one of the reasons people end up back on the streets. A comprehensive solution means pairing housing with mental health services, substance abuse treatment, job training, and other essential resources. It’s about creating a system of support that stays with people, helping them stay stable in the long term. For neighbors living in areas with visible homelessness and mental health challenges, this isn’t just a political issue—it’s a daily reality. It’s about feeling safe in your community and knowing that people who are struggling are receiving the help they need to recover and reintegrate. With a comprehensive, compassionate approach, we can provide solutions that benefit both those experiencing homelessness and the broader community. By investing in both housing and mental health services, we can create neighborhoods that are safer, more stable, and more supportive for everyone. How would you support the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association? As a community advocate, I recognize that neighborhood associations like the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association (MHNA) are the foundation of a thriving community. As Council Member, I am committed to being actively involved with MHNA by regularly attending meetings and engaging with residents to stay informed about the challenges they face. By maintaining a consistent presence in the community, I will ensure that I have my ear to the ground and can effectively advocate for the needs of Murray Hill residents. In addition to direct engagement, I will work to secure discretionary funding from the City to support MHNA and its local initiatives sustainably. These funds will be vital in enhancing community projects, strengthening local programs, and addressing pressing neighborhood issues. I will prioritize an open, ongoing feedback loop between my office and MHNA leadership, ensuring I am always up to date on residents’ concerns. This collaboration will enable me to advocate for practical, actionable solutions, while ensuring that the MHNA has the necessary resources and support to continue its essential work.
