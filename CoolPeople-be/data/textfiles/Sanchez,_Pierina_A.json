This ensures that such critical information is made accessible to every family across the city. “Students across New York City deserve access to enrichment opportunities that allow them to become the fullest version of themselves,” said Council Member Pierina Sanchez. “But too often, families are unaware that these opportunities exist. Today, through Int. 432-A, the Council is making strides to ensure nearly 1 million young people and their families receive information about afterschool and enrichment programs available to them. For the first time in NYC history, starting this fall at every public K-12 elementary, middle, and high school, NYC will be required to provide every student with a printed and digital copy of afterschool opportunities available to them, either funded by NYC Public Schools or the Department of Youth and Community Development. I pride myself in allocating funds to ensure each school building in our district hosts after school or enrichment programs within its walls–and now, our parents will know about them. In a city as well-resourced as New York City, there’s no excuse for any student, parent, or guardian to miss out for lack of information.” “Afterschool programs are vital for students’ educational and personal development. For working-class families, these activities often serve as crucial public childcare resources. However, the inconsistency of afterschool programs creates unnecessary barriers to access. I applaud Council Member Sanchez on the passage of her bill and look forward to seeing afterschool informational materials distributed throughout my district,” said Council Member Alexa Avilés. “As the mother of two public school students, I know how important afterschool programs are to both students and parents. Afterschool programs not only enhance a child’s education, but they are also a lifeline for working parents. That is why this legislation that makes information about afterschool programs more widely available is so vital. I would like to thank Council Member Pierina Sanchez for her leadership on this issue and I look forward to this bill being enacted,” stated Council Member Susan Zhuang. About the bill: Access to information about afterschool activities is often inconsistent across schools, creating barriers for students trying to participate in these valuable programs. By requiring schools to distribute this information directly to the school community, Int. 432-A will bridge the gap between students who otherwise would not enroll and those who will. Starting in Fall 2025, K-12 public schools will be required to provide comprehensive information about afterschool activities available to students and their parents or guardians. This includes programs funded by NYC Public Schools or the Department of Youth and Community Development. Every fall and spring semester thereafter, schools must share updated listings that include program descriptions, eligibility requirements, application processes, and any associated costs. To ensure accessibility, schools will distribute this information through multiple channels: via email to families, printed packages sent home with students, posted on the school’s website, and made available on any school portal used by students and the community. ### Posted in Uncategorized COUNCIL MEMBER PIERINA SANCHEZ PASSES LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE NEARLY ONE MILLION STUDENTS WITH AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAM MATERIALS February 14, 2025 New York, NY – February 13, 2025 – Today, the New York City Council passed Int. 432-A, legislation introduced by Council Member Pierina Sanchez, which requires NYC Public Schools to provide informational materials to all K-12 students on afterschool activities available at their schools.

This ensures that such critical information is made accessible to every family across the city. “Students across New York City deserve access to enrichment opportunities that allow them to become the fullest version of themselves,” said Council Member Pierina Sanchez. “But too often, families are unaware that these opportunities exist. Today, through Int. 432-A, the Council is making strides to ensure nearly 1 million young people and their families receive information about afterschool and enrichment programs available to them.

Today, through Int. 432-A, the Council is making strides to ensure nearly 1 million young people and their families receive information about afterschool and enrichment programs available to them. For the first time in NYC history, starting this fall at every public K-12 elementary, middle, and high school, NYC will be required to provide every student with a printed and digital copy of afterschool opportunities available to them, either funded by NYC Public Schools or the Department of Youth and Community Development. I pride myself in allocating funds to ensure each school building in our district hosts after school or enrichment programs within its walls–and now, our parents will know about them. In a city as well-resourced as New York City, there’s no excuse for any student, parent, or guardian to miss out for lack of information.” “Afterschool programs are vital for students’ educational and personal development. For working-class families, these activities often serve as crucial public childcare resources. However, the inconsistency of afterschool programs creates unnecessary barriers to access. I applaud Council Member Sanchez on the passage of her bill and look forward to seeing afterschool informational materials distributed throughout my district,” said Council Member Alexa Avilés. “As the mother of two public school students, I know how important afterschool programs are to both students and parents. Afterschool programs not only enhance a child’s education, but they are also a lifeline for working parents. That is why this legislation that makes information about afterschool programs more widely available is so vital. I would like to thank Council Member Pierina Sanchez for her leadership on this issue and I look forward to this bill being enacted,” stated Council Member Susan Zhuang. About the bill: Access to information about afterschool activities is often inconsistent across schools, creating barriers for students trying to participate in these valuable programs. By requiring schools to distribute this information directly to the school community, Int. 432-A will bridge the gap between students who otherwise would not enroll and those who will. Starting in Fall 2025, K-12 public schools will be required to provide comprehensive information about afterschool activities available to students and their parents or guardians. This includes programs funded by NYC Public Schools or the Department of Youth and Community Development. Every fall and spring semester thereafter, schools must share updated listings that include program descriptions, eligibility requirements, application processes, and any associated costs.

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity. Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University. From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors. Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center. Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative. Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community. When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

Pierina is an Afro-Dominicana, daughter of immigrants, and born and raised in the Bronx, where her family strove to make a life for her and her brothers. She learned the value of hard work early – watching her elders sell oranges, drive taxis, clean buildings and schools – to ensure she and her generation had a chance at higher education and opportunity. Pierina is a proud alumna of Bronx public schools P.S. 46 and M.S. 45, and the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula. She values public youth programs because the Bronx Community College Upward Bound program helped her excel. She went on to graduate from Harvard University on a full scholarship, and earn a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University. From the community board to the White House, and from work in advocacy organizations to the mayor’s office – Pierina has been a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, good jobs and meaningful investments in our children, families and seniors. Pierina began her career in public service in the summer of 2007, and it propelled her into a career in public policy and urban planning. She advocated to expand early education programs at Agenda for Children Tomorrow, and helped immigrant families stabilize their status in the US. Immediately after graduating college, Pierina came back home to work in Council District 14 office, supporting thousands of her neighbors with their concerns, including organizing buildings to fight landlords for repairs. She helped to secure millions of dollars in City funding for nonprofits and schools in the community, including the funds to construct the Harrison Circle location of the Morris Heights Health Center. Pierina served in the Obama White House and after her master’s program, as an urban planner at Regional Plan Association. At RPA, Pierina was committed to the mission that any plan for the New York region must be built on a foundation of equity and social justice. She partnered with frontline community organizations to include thousands of low- to moderate- income voices from immigrants and communities of color and shape the critical planning process. During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative. Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community. When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!

During this time, Pierina was also a member of Bronx Community Board 5, where she fought for deep affordable housing and meaningful investments during the Jerome rezoning process, and later cofounded the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative. Most recently, Pierina was an advisor in the mayor’s office, where she advocated for progressive housing, economic development and land use policies, and resources for NYCHA. When COVID-19 struck, Pierina’s work pivoted to the City’s response and she focused on bridging gaps in service to the hardest hit low-income and communities of color. Alongside colleagues, she pushed to add testing sites, distribute protective equipment, and ensure the meal delivery system was reaching every New Yorker in need. Pierina also developed an action plan to protect our neighbors in NYCHA. After the mayor’s office, Pierina was a Senior Fellow at the Pratt Center for Community Development and worked within Bronx mutual aid networks to distribute thousands of meals within the community. When she is not serving the public, Pierina enjoys practicing Taekwondo and dancing salsa!
