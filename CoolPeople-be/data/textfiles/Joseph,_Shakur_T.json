OUR FIGHT. Year-Round Access to 3K and 4K Programs I will fight to provide year-round 3K and 4K programs, ensuring families have access to high-quality, early education and free childcare support. Universal Community Schools I will fight to transform every school into a community school—a hub for mental and medical care, enrichment and after-school programs, adult education, and tailored support that uplifts every community member in the Bronx. Teacher Wage Justice I will fight to ensure every teacher earns a minimum salary of $90,000 and secure funding for professional development and classroom resources. Our educators deserve fair wages and the tools to prepare our children for success. Education Equity Education Equity City-Run Wholesale and Community Distribution Center I will fight for a city-run wholesale center that supplies affordable food to community supermarkets and co-ops. By reducing costs for local stores, we can ensure families have access to fresh, nutritious groceries at prices they can afford. Dinner and Weekend Meals for Everyone I will push for the expansion of school meal programs, including supper services and weekend meals. Every child deserves to go to bed with food in their stomach, and families in need should have access to reliable food support year-round—especially families who are low income and living in temporary housing. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) I will work with Bronx-based companies like FreshDirect, Golden Krust, Morton Williams, and others to establish CSR programs that reduce food insecurity. These programs will include organizing food drives, sponsoring meal programs, and investing in local initiatives while creating jobs that support our local economy. Food Rescue Initiative for Shelters and Homeless Services I will fight to launch a Food Rescue Initiative, partnering with local businesses to redirect surplus food to shelters and homeless services thereby reducing waste while ensuring our most vulnerable neighbors have access to nutritious meals. Reinstate Hot Meal Purchases for SNAP I will fight to reinstate hot meal purchases for seniors and individuals in temporary housing under SNAP benefits, ensuring vulnerable residents have access to hot, nutritious meals when they lack mobility, access, and preparation space.

The digital divide ends here, and every child will have the tools to access modern learning. Incarceration Reform Incarceration Reform Housing Justice Housing Justice Abolish Solitary Confinement I will fight for a complete ban on solitary confinement in New York City facilities. Solitary confinement is inhumane and ineffective, leaving individuals with lasting psychological damage. End Slave Wages for Incarcerated Individuals I will fight to end the practice of slave wages by demanding fair wages for incarcerated workers. This will reduce the financial burden on families who often bear the costs of supporting an incarcerated loved one. Eliminate Technical Violations as Grounds for Re-incarceration I will demand legislation to eliminate technical violations as grounds for imprisonment. Minor infractions like missing curfews or failing to report to an officer shouldn’t lead to re-incarceration.

As someone who has lived through many of the challenges our community faces, I’m committed to creating real change by improving education, ensuring housing stability, addressing food insecurity, or supporting those reentering society after incarceration. I know what it’s like to feel the weight of these issues firsthand, and I’m dedicated to being a leader who understands and fights for our needs. While I was investing in school, I still faced challenges at home. From an early age, my family was deeply affected by mass incarceration. From my earliest memory, I never had my entire family in one place. All 7 of my brothers encountered the criminal justice system at a young age, resulting in repeated arrests, distrust of the system, and a disruption in my family’s stability. The absence of my brothers during these years meant losing out on access, guidance, and support throughout my middle school life, which ultimately led me to engage in the cycle as well. At the age of 12, I was arrested for larceny of school property because I wanted a laptop at home—something I didn’t have access to or the funds to obtain. Although this was an isolated incident, it was a reality that shaped my childhood, instilling in me a deep understanding of how systemic barriers can tear families apart and influence poor decision-making for children who lack resources, as I did. After my investment in school and my encounter with the criminal justice system, I realized that I needed to create opportunities for myself and gain access to resources to improve my family’s life. High school became a chance for me to do that. At the age of 14, I started working, and throughout my teens, I took on odd jobs to help at home, buy groceries, and contribute to paying bills. The lack of resources my family had pushed me into an adult role early, shifting my focus away from hanging out with peers to becoming a semi-provider for my family. By 16, I had moved out of my mother’s house and began supporting myself. I worked multiple jobs, paid rent, and attended school, often juggling more than I thought I could handle. These struggles taught me the importance of resilience and drive. I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility, and that’s why I’m committed to supporting others who face similar challenges. My experiences drive my belief that everyone deserves the chance to succeed, and I’ve dedicated my career to making that a reality for people and families in my community.

The absence of my brothers during these years meant losing out on access, guidance, and support throughout my middle school life, which ultimately led me to engage in the cycle as well. At the age of 12, I was arrested for larceny of school property because I wanted a laptop at home—something I didn’t have access to or the funds to obtain. Although this was an isolated incident, it was a reality that shaped my childhood, instilling in me a deep understanding of how systemic barriers can tear families apart and influence poor decision-making for children who lack resources, as I did. After my investment in school and my encounter with the criminal justice system, I realized that I needed to create opportunities for myself and gain access to resources to improve my family’s life. High school became a chance for me to do that. At the age of 14, I started working, and throughout my teens, I took on odd jobs to help at home, buy groceries, and contribute to paying bills. The lack of resources my family had pushed me into an adult role early, shifting my focus away from hanging out with peers to becoming a semi-provider for my family. By 16, I had moved out of my mother’s house and began supporting myself. I worked multiple jobs, paid rent, and attended school, often juggling more than I thought I could handle. These struggles taught me the importance of resilience and drive. I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility, and that’s why I’m committed to supporting others who face similar challenges. My experiences drive my belief that everyone deserves the chance to succeed, and I’ve dedicated my career to making that a reality for people and families in my community. While I was investing in school, I still faced challenges at home. From an early age, my family was deeply affected by mass incarceration.

For over a decade, I’ve dedicated my life to youth development and nonprofit work, building relationships and creating opportunities for others. Through my roles in various nonprofits and education institutions, I’ve had the privilege of working with young people who, like me, have faced hardships in many different ways. I’ve worked in education-centered nonprofit programs that provided wraparound services to students, closing the achievement gap and supporting their emotional and academic growth. I’ve also partnered in organizations focused on suicide prevention and helping youth navigate their identities, ensuring they have the resources and support they need to thrive. Across all of these roles, my mission has always been clear: to create spaces where young people can be seen, heard, and supported in ways that allow them to succeed. This drive to make a difference extends beyond youth development. My campaign is grounded in four core issues that I know are crucial to our community: education, housing, access to food, and supporting those reentering society after incarceration. These are issues I’ve lived through, and they are the same struggles I see families in the Bronx facing every day.

    "text": "jobs to help at home, buy groceries, and contribute to paying bills. The lack of resources my family had pushed me into an adult role early, shifting my focus away from hanging out with peers to becoming a semi-provider for my family. By 16, I had moved out of my mother’s house and began supporting myself. I worked multiple jobs, paid rent, and attended school, often juggling more than I thought I could handle. These struggles taught me the importance of resilience and drive. I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility, and that’s why I’m committed to supporting others who face similar challenges. My experiences drive my belief that everyone deserves the chance to succeed, and I’ve dedicated my career to making that a reality for people and families in my community. For over a decade, I’ve dedicated my life to youth development and nonprofit work, building relationships and creating opportunities for others. For over a decade, I’ve dedicated my life to youth development and nonprofit work, building relationships and creating opportunities for others. Through my roles in various nonprofits and education institutions, I’ve had the privilege of working with young people who, like me, have faced hardships in many different ways. I’ve worked in education-centered nonprofit programs that provided wraparound services to students, closing the achievement gap and supporting their emotional and academic growth. I’ve also partnered in organizations focused on suicide prevention and helping youth navigate their identities, ensuring they have the resources and support they need to thrive. Across all of these roles, my mission has always been clear: to create spaces where young people can be seen, heard, and supported in ways that allow them to succeed. This drive to make a difference extends beyond youth development. My campaign is grounded in four core issues that I know are crucial to our community: education, housing, access to food, and supporting those reentering society after incarceration. These are issues I’ve lived through, and they are the same struggles I see families in the Bronx facing every day. My work has always been about building communities where people have the resources they need to thrive—whether in the classroom, at home, or in everyday life.

In 2020, as our country confronted racial injustice on a large scale, I found myself inspired to do more for my community. Watching people come together to demand better was a powerful reminder that we deserve more than what we’ve been dealing with for so long. That moment wasn’t just about protests; it was about recognizing that our communities have the power to demand change and overcome injustice. That inspiration has stayed with me, and it’s why I’m running for City Council. I believe that the Bronx deserves leadership that sees, hears, and fights for every resident. I’ve been in the same shoes as so many people in our district—working hard, trying to balance responsibilities, and fighting for a better life. That’s why I’m committed to creating opportunities that make life easier and more equitable for everyone. I’m running for City Council because I believe that together, we can build a Bronx where every family has the resources and support they need to thrive."
