The bill mandates a goal of 100 Megawatts (MW) on city-owned buildings by 2025, and expands the target to 150MW on buildings and other public properties by 2030. The bill was introduced just in time for Climate Week NYC, and demonstrates the Council‚Äôs clear commitment to addressing the climate crisis and investing in a just and clean energy future. The bill builds on and codifies previous goals outlined in OneNYC and again in the latest PlaNYC, to ensure the administration is on track to meet the city‚Äôs clean energy goals. The City must be aggressive in urgently and equitably meeting our climate goals. NYC can catalyze good union labor jobs by leveraging federal opportunities to fund solar. The City can address environmental injustices by prioritizing investments in disadvantaged communities. The bill is supported by Climate Jobs New York and Climate Works for All. ‚ÄúThe climate crisis is truly at a breaking point and necessitates investments in solutions faster than we ever have before,‚Äù said Council Member Sandy Nurse. ‚ÄúIt is madness to wait any longer to install solar power for clean renewable energy on NYC buildings. We must rapidly draw down our use of fossil fuels at every possible opportunity. Not doing so puts our city and entire younger generations in extreme danger.‚Äù ‚ÄúClimate change‚Äôs effects are alarmingly more visible every day, and the longer we wait to act, the less of a chance we have to change the tides. New York City has the potential to lead the nation in carbon emission reduction and climate action while providing green union jobs to a labor market that is ready to work. This bill is one step in that direction,‚Äù said Council Member Carmen De La Rosa . ‚ÄúWe commend Council Member Nurse for taking the lead to codify the much needed goal of installing 100MW of solar systems on public buildings by 2025 and 150MW by 2030. This would help NYC rapidly scale up sustainable and reliable energy systems to meet the interrelated crises of climate change, public health, and social inequality‚Äù said Shravanthi Kanekal, Resiliency Planner at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance and co-coordinator of the Climate Works for All coalition. ‚ÄúThis is common-sense legislation that will create green union jobs, deliver renewable energy to communities citywide, and take another step forward in building Green, Healthy Schools,‚Äù said Lucas Shapiro, Interim Executive Director for ALIGN, co-coordinators of the Climate Works for All coalition . ‚ÄúOur relentless climate crisis demands urgency and action, and we are proud to work with CM Nurse to envision an equitable, sustainable future for our schools and all other public buildings across our city.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the face of the climate crisis, our council is taking bold steps towards a cleaner, more resilient future. If passed, our city will produce 100 megawatts of clean electricity through solar photovoltaic systems on city buildings by 2025, and by 2030, we‚Äôll reach 150 megawatts, proving that we‚Äôre committed to environmental stewardship even as others threaten our climate progress. We‚Äôre not just installing solar panels; we‚Äôre prioritizing environmental justice, ensuring that all communities have equal access to the benefits of clean energy, reduced energy costs, and green job opportunities, while also protecting workers‚Äô rights with project labor agreements. This initiative represents a comprehensive commitment to a greener, fairer, and more sustainable city, and we invite everyone to join us in this transformative journey.‚Äù said Rami Dinnawi, Environmental Justice Campaign & Policy Manager at El Puente. ‚ÄúPutting solar on the thousands of city-owned buildings will make New York City a leader in reducing our carbon footprint. If done right, this legislation"

The bill is supported by Climate Jobs New York and Climate Works for All. ‚ÄúThe climate crisis is truly at a breaking point and necessitates investments in solutions faster than we ever have before,‚Äù said Council Member Sandy Nurse. ‚ÄúIt is madness to wait any longer to install solar power for clean renewable energy on NYC buildings.

New York City has the potential to lead the nation in carbon emission reduction and climate action while providing green union jobs to a labor market that is ready to work. This bill is one step in that direction,‚Äù said Council Member Carmen De La Rosa . ‚ÄúWe commend Council Member Nurse for taking the lead to codify the much needed goal of installing 100MW of solar systems on public buildings by 2025 and 150MW by 2030. This would help NYC rapidly scale up sustainable and reliable energy systems to meet the interrelated crises of climate change, public health, and social inequality‚Äù said Shravanthi Kanekal, Resiliency Planner at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance and co-coordinator of the Climate Works for All coalition. ‚ÄúThis is common-sense legislation that will create green union jobs, deliver renewable energy to communities citywide, and take another step forward in building Green, Healthy Schools,‚Äù said Lucas Shapiro, Interim Executive Director for ALIGN, co-coordinators of the Climate Works for All coalition . ‚ÄúOur relentless climate crisis demands urgency and action, and we are proud to work with CM Nurse to envision an equitable, sustainable future for our schools and all other public buildings across our city.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the face of the climate crisis, our council is taking bold steps towards a cleaner, more resilient future.

This is an important first step in making every New York City public school building a clean and healthy place to learn and to work in addition to creating thousands of good union green jobs.

BACKGROUND: New York City can lead the way in the transition to a renewable energy future by prioritizing solar energy installation on city-owned buildings and other public properties. In 2014, the City announced the goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050 (known as 80√ó50), and committed to installing 100 MW of solar energy on public buildings by 2025. The primary City agency responsible for our public sector transition to renewable energy is the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The DCAS Division of Energy Management leads the City‚Äôs energy conservation and sustainability efforts. According to the 2022 City of New York Municipal Solar Readiness Assessment report, DCAS oversees more than 10,000 utility accounts for city government agencies across 4,000 public buildings. It implements creative solutions to reduce energy consumption, promote energy efficiency in public buildings, and to generate clean energy on City-owned properties. This is a moment New York City can go big‚Äîenlisting federal, state and city support and building on earlier work to put solar on some New York City schools, public land, parking lots, industrial facilities, and more. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes over $350 billion of investment in clean energy and climate change mitigation, and extended the renewable energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to municipal governments for the first time in history. Furthermore, the City can use energy savings from these solar installations to reinvest into our communities. New York City buildings also need investments to become ‚Äúsolar-ready,‚Äù for example many school buildings are in need of basic repairs and upgrades, including deteriorating rooftops and outdated electrical grids. School buildings should be healthy and safe for students and staff and be a model for carbon free buildings in the effort to combat climate change. As of July 2022, DCAS has a total installed solar photovoltaic capacity of 16.7 MW across 115 city-owned buildings, with another 46.3 MW of solar capacity currently in development. While New York City has made progress in meeting solar targets, there is more work to be done to ensure we are leading in the transition to a renewable energy future and centering workers and communities.

I‚Äôm proud to support Council Member Nurse and her legislation to bring more solar power to our public buildings,‚Äù said Council Member Lincoln Restler. BACKGROUND: New York City can lead the way in the transition to a renewable energy future by prioritizing solar energy installation on city-owned buildings and other public properties. In 2014, the City announced the goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050 (known as 80√ó50), and committed to installing 100 MW of solar energy on public buildings by 2025. The primary City agency responsible for our public sector transition to renewable energy is the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The DCAS Division of Energy Management leads the City‚Äôs energy conservation and sustainability efforts. According to the 2022 City of New York Municipal Solar Readiness Assessment report, DCAS oversees more than 10,000 utility accounts for city government agencies across 4,000 public buildings. It implements creative solutions to reduce energy consumption, promote energy efficiency in public buildings, and to generate clean energy on City-owned properties. This is a moment New York City can go big‚Äîenlisting federal, state and city support and building on earlier work to put solar on some New York City schools, public land, parking lots, industrial facilities, and more. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes over $350 billion of investment in clean energy and climate change mitigation, and extended the renewable energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to municipal governments for the first time in history. Furthermore, the City can use energy savings from these solar installations to reinvest into our communities. New York City buildings also need investments to become ‚Äúsolar-ready,‚Äù for example many school buildings are in need of basic repairs and upgrades, including deteriorating rooftops and outdated electrical grids. School buildings should be healthy and safe for students and staff and be a model for carbon free buildings in the effort to combat climate change. As of July 2022, DCAS has a total installed solar photovoltaic capacity of 16.7 MW across 115 city-owned buildings, with another 46.3 MW of solar capacity currently in development. While New York City has made progress in meeting solar targets, there is more work to be done to ensure we are leading in the transition to a renewable energy future and centering workers and communities.

The bill mandates a goal of 100 Megawatts (MW) on city-owned buildings by 2025, and expands the target to 150MW on buildings and other public properties by 2030. The bill was introduced just in time for Climate Week NYC, and demonstrates the Council‚Äôs clear commitment to addressing the climate crisis and investing in a just and clean energy future. The bill builds on and codifies previous goals outlined in OneNYC and again in the latest PlaNYC, to ensure the administration is on track to meet the city‚Äôs clean energy goals. The City must be aggressive in urgently and equitably meeting our climate goals. NYC can catalyze good union labor jobs by leveraging federal opportunities to fund solar. The City can address environmental injustices by prioritizing investments in disadvantaged communities. The bill is supported by Climate Jobs New York and Climate Works for All. ‚ÄúThe climate crisis is truly at a breaking point and necessitates investments in solutions faster than we ever have before,‚Äù said Council Member Sandy Nurse. ‚ÄúIt is madness to wait any longer to install solar power for clean renewable energy on NYC buildings. We must rapidly draw down our use of fossil fuels at every possible opportunity.

New York City has the potential to lead the nation in carbon emission reduction and climate action while providing green union jobs to a labor market that is ready to work. This bill is one step in that direction,‚Äù said Council Member Carmen De La Rosa . ‚ÄúWe commend Council Member Nurse for taking the lead to codify the much needed goal of installing 100MW of solar systems on public buildings by 2025 and 150MW by 2030.

The bill mandates a goal of 100 Megawatts (MW) on city-owned buildings by 2025, and expands the target to 150MW on buildings and other public properties by 2030. The bill was introduced just in time for Climate Week NYC, and demonstrates the Council‚Äôs clear commitment to addressing the climate crisis and investing in a just and clean energy future. The bill builds on and codifies previous goals outlined in OneNYC and again in the latest PlaNYC, to ensure the administration is on track to meet the city‚Äôs clean energy goals. The City must be aggressive in urgently and equitably meeting our climate goals. NYC can catalyze good union labor jobs by leveraging federal opportunities to fund solar. The City can address environmental injustices by prioritizing investments in disadvantaged communities. The bill is supported by Climate Jobs New York and Climate Works for All. ‚ÄúThe climate crisis is truly at a breaking point and necessitates investments in solutions faster than we ever have before,‚Äù said Council Member Sandy Nurse. ‚ÄúIt is madness to wait any longer to install solar power for clean renewable energy on NYC buildings. We must rapidly draw down our use of fossil fuels at every possible opportunity. Not doing so puts our city and entire younger generations in extreme danger.‚Äù ‚ÄúClimate change‚Äôs effects are alarmingly more visible every day, and the longer we wait to act, the less of a chance we have to change the tides. New York City has the potential to lead the nation in carbon emission reduction and climate action while providing green union jobs to a labor market that is ready to work. This bill is one step in that direction,‚Äù said Council Member Carmen De La Rosa . ‚ÄúWe commend Council Member Nurse for taking the lead to codify the much needed goal of installing 100MW of solar systems on public buildings by 2025 and 150MW by 2030. This would help NYC rapidly scale up sustainable and reliable energy systems to meet the interrelated crises of climate change, public health, and social inequality‚Äù said Shravanthi Kanekal, Resiliency Planner at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance and co-coordinator of the Climate Works for All coalition. ‚ÄúThis is common-sense legislation that will create green union jobs, deliver renewable energy to communities citywide, and take another step forward in building Green, Healthy Schools,‚Äù said Lucas Shapiro, Interim Executive Director for ALIGN, co-coordinators of the Climate Works for All coalition . ‚ÄúOur relentless climate crisis demands urgency and action, and we are proud to work with CM Nurse to envision an equitable, sustainable future for our schools and all other public buildings across our city.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the face of the climate"

The primary City agency responsible for our public sector transition to renewable energy is the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The DCAS Division of Energy Management leads the City‚Äôs energy conservation and sustainability efforts. According to the 2022 City of New York Municipal Solar Readiness Assessment report, DCAS oversees more than 10,000 utility accounts for city government agencies across 4,000 public buildings. It implements creative solutions to reduce energy consumption, promote energy efficiency in public buildings, and to generate clean energy on City-owned properties. This is a moment New York City can go big‚Äîenlisting federal, state and city support and building on earlier work to put solar on some New York City schools, public land, parking lots, industrial facilities, and more.

If done right, this legislation could lead to the creation of thousands of good jobs and an entry into a lifetime career for young workers and workers of color,‚Äù said Gary LaBarbera, President of The New York State Building Trades and Principal Officer of Climate Jobs NY. ‚ÄúInvesting in clean energy to power our public buildings will reduce New York City‚Äôs energy costs while improving building energy efficiencies. New York can take advantage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the environmental bond act to help defray the cost of installing solar on our public buildings while creating thousands of good union jobs,‚Äù said Vincent Alvarez, President of the New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO and principal officer of Climate Jobs NY. ‚ÄúWe applaud Councilmember Nurse for introducing legislation to accelerate the transition to solar on New York‚Äôs public buildings prioritizing New York City‚Äôs public schools. This is an important first step in making every New York City public school building a clean and healthy place to learn and to work in addition to creating thousands of good union green jobs. Extreme weather events like the recent wildfires remind us how urgent it is we take immediate action for a just transition to renewable energy. Let‚Äôs invest in responsible solutions to build a sustainable and just future,‚Äù said Lenore Friedlaender, Executive Director of Climate Jobs NY. ‚ÄúMaximizing public solar to power New York City is a critical component in bringing down our emissions and tackling the climate crisis. I‚Äôm proud to support Council Member Nurse and her legislation to bring more solar power to our public buildings,‚Äù said Council Member Lincoln Restler. BACKGROUND: New York City can lead the way in the transition to a renewable energy future by prioritizing solar energy installation on city-owned buildings and other public properties. In 2014, the City announced the goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050 (known as 80√ó50), and committed to installing 100 MW of solar energy on public buildings by 2025. The primary City agency responsible for our public sector transition to renewable energy is the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The DCAS Division of Energy Management leads the City‚Äôs energy conservation and sustainability efforts. According to the 2022 City of New York Municipal Solar Readiness Assessment report, DCAS oversees more than 10,000 utility accounts for city government agencies across 4,000 public buildings. It implements creative solutions to reduce energy consumption, promote energy efficiency in public buildings, and to generate clean energy on City-owned properties. This is a moment New York City can go big‚Äîenlisting federal, state and city support and building on earlier work to put solar on some New York City schools, public land, parking lots, industrial facilities, and more. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes over $350 billion of investment in clean energy and climate change mitigation, and extended the renewable energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to municipal governments for the first time in history. Furthermore, the City can use energy savings from these solar installations to reinvest into our communities. New York City buildings also need investments to become ‚Äúsolar-ready,‚Äù for example many school buildings are in need of basic repairs and upgrades, including deteriorating rooftops and outdated electrical grids. School buildings should be healthy and safe for students and staff and be a model for carbon free buildings in the effort to combat climate change. As of July 2022, DCAS has a total installed solar photovoltaic capacity of 16.7 MW across 115 city-owned buildings, with another 46.3 MW of solar capacity currently in development. While New York"
