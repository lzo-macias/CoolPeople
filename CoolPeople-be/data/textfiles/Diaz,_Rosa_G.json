A proud member of the District 8 community. My mission is to keep supporting and advocating for families and the disadvantaged communities. I'm here to tell you that Rosa cares about YOU! In my early years, while I was still in my country Peru living with my Grandparents, all I did was go to school, help around the house, go to the corral and run errands. Never thought I was going to be able to make a difference with my experience, knowledge and skills. Since I came to the USA, in early 2000, I cannot say that my life was easier at all. Everything has been a challenge, from learning a new language, adjusting my whole life, losing contact with my family, advocating for myself and translating for my mom in the complicated and challenging New York City Public Educational System. But the need for knowledge, my eagerness to keep learning and advocating has brought me to a higher demand in my passion for helping others in need. As people say, knowledge is power.

But the need for knowledge, my eagerness to keep learning and advocating has brought me to a higher demand in my passion for helping others in need. As people say, knowledge is power. For most of my life, I have been serving, advocating and protecting families’ rights, especially many immigrant families in my neighborhood who do not know their rights in this country, USA. My work began when I started volunteering at East Harlem Community Partnership, a division of the Administration for Children Services. I empathize with all the current services and resources people need, from serving food, food pantry, clothing drive, Christmas events, learning a new language support etc. I saw my work making a difference in people’s lives and soon became my passion. Then, partnering with other non-profits doing the work, I began to welcome new migrants, educate them about the Department of Education's complicated system and how to enroll their child in school and all the wonderful opportunities and resources there are for families. I can truly say that I am proud of supporting and being able to provide safe, and accountable support to those in great need.
