    "text": "Superstar Frank Morano About Frank Morano is Staten Island’s favorite son (self proclaimed) and brings the wisdom of a common sense New Yorker and an encyclopedic knowledge of local politics to the microphone to offer listeners a refreshing perspective on the news of the day. As the host of the highly rated “ The Other Side of Midnight,” Morano delves into exploring the mysteries of the world: ranging from assassination conspiracy theories to UFOs. Morano is also a longtime observer of the criminal justice system and spends much time analyzing some of the most controversial cases in the news in a way that’s easy for people to understand. He also has a singular wit and a dry sense of humor, which leads listeners to wonder whether he was being sarcastic hours after his show ends. His show also features celebrity interviews, in-depth discussion of pop culture and humorous stories from his personal life, translated into parables, in the tradition of Jean Shepherd. In addition to his work on radio, Frank is one of New York’s leading activists in electoral reform and independent politics. Having been a leader in the state’s Independence Party, Reform Party and SAM Party, he’s a passionate advocate for a variety of centrist populist causes and one of New York’s leading experts on the subjects of ballot access and third parties. Frank previously served as a producer for some of the biggest names in talk radio and as a producer and on-air contributor on the NewsmaxTV show, “Liquid Lunch.” He also hosts a podcast focused on long form conversation, debate and storytelling, with an emphasis on organized crime. He was a producer of the Netflix original documentary, “ Get Me Roger Stone” and has a fondness for cheese, Star Trek, the NY Mets and all things related to Atlantic City.

With a passion for public service, civic engagement, and community betterment, Frank brings decades of experience in media, local government, and advocacy to his candidacy for City Council. For nearly two decades, Frank has been a prominent voice in talk radio. Since 2020, he has hosted “The Other Side of Midnight” on 77WABC, which has been nationally syndicated for the past two years. Previously, he worked as a producer and talk show host alongside some of the biggest names in radio, including Curtis Sliwa, John Gambling, Joe Piscopo, and Ron Kuby. Frank also served as co-host and Managing Editor of “Liquid Lunch” on Newsmax TV and worked part-time for two years on the staff of City Councilman Joe Borelli. Frank’s commitment to Staten Island extends far beyond the airwaves. He has served on Community Board 3 since 2013 (with a brief pause to serve on Councilman Borelli), where he has worked to amplify residents’ voices and achieve tangible improvements for the community. Most recently, he led the effort to resume in-person Board meetings after more than four years of virtual sessions, prioritizing accountability and community engagement. Frank has been appointed to the Board by three different Borough Presidents, underscoring his bipartisan approach and commitment to serving Staten Islanders. A lifelong advocate for political reform and electoral integrity, Frank has testified before every NYC Charter Revision Commission since 2002, offering practical solutions to make city governance more effective and responsive. He has worked on numerous political campaigns and managed then-Councilman Vincent Ignizio’s successful 2013 re-election campaign. Additionally, he has served in leadership roles within the state’s Independence and Reform Parties, demonstrating his dedication to bipartisan collaboration and improving the electoral process. Frank’s media career has also included hosting “Morano Vision” , a popular Staten Island cable TV show that earned a Guinness World Record in 2005 for the longest live talk show marathon. Beyond his professional achievements, Frank has been deeply involved in philanthropy. As a volunteer and Ambassador for the National Psoriasis Foundation, he has worked to raise awareness and support for those affected by the condition. He has also raised tens of thousands of dollars and donated countless hours to organizations like the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, children’s cancer research initiatives, and other local charities. Frank lives in Eltingville with his wife, Rachel, and their three-year-old son, Carmine. As a husband, father, and lifelong Staten Islander, Frank understands the challenges facing families and communities in New York City and is committed to ensuring a brighter future for all. 2025 HELP FRANK WIN PAID FOR BY MORANO FOR CITY COUNCIL twitter twitter facebook facebook instagram instagram Privacy Policy | Mobile Terms | Contact Us Close Menu Meet Frank Issues News In the News Watch In the News Watch Take Action Where to Vote Pledge Your Vote Email Sign-Up Volunteer Request a Sign Contact Us Donate Now Where to Vote Pledge Your Vote Email Sign-Up Volunteer Request a Sign Contact Us Donate Now DONATE"
