Transforming New York’s Housing Landscape The City of Yes initiative, which Coleman ardently supports, represents the most significant overhaul of New York’s zoning laws since 1961. The comprehensive package aims to create 80,000 new homes over the next decade, making it the largest affordable housing proposal in the city’s history. “The beauty of City of Yes is that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” Coleman explains. “It is carefully targeted at low, medium, and high-density districts, with different proposals for each.” The initiative includes eliminating costly parking mandates in low-density areas and introducing a 20% zoning bonus for including affordable housing in medium and high-density districts. Addressing Common Misconceptions Coleman, a Boston University Law School graduate who recently left his position as a litigator to campaign full-time, addresses a key criticism of the initiative. “The biggest myth that gets spread about this, particularly in my district, is that there’s no affordable housing component to this law,” he explains. Critics argue the law doesn’t guarantee affordable housing, but Coleman notes this stems from constitutional constraints rather than policy choice. “Unfortunately, you can’t do that (mandate affordable housing requirements) in the United States,” Coleman explains. “We have something called the due process clause and the takings clause. You can’t just take private land and tell developers ‘This is what you have to build on it.'” Instead, he describes how the law creates a pragmatic incentive structure: “What cities do instead is say, ‘Okay, we can’t make you do it, but if you want to build to the maximum capacity on this land, if you want to have the best economics for this project with tax incentives, you have to have 25% affordable housing.'” This approach, working in conjunction with new state tax incentives, is expected to create approximately 20,000 affordable units over the next decade. Impact on Real Estate Development For the real estate industry, Coleman suggests the benefits will be modest but meaningful. “Big developers, a lot of the time, can get their projects through anyway,” he notes. “This isn’t a huge boon for developers – it’s a people-driven plan.” The universal affordability preference offering a 20% bonus will make it easier for developers to participate in the 485x tax incentive program, improving project economics while ensuring community benefits. Beyond Housing: A Comprehensive Vision Coleman’s platform addresses various urban challenges beyond housing, advocating for integrated solutions as co-chair of Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee. He promotes pedestrian-friendly initiatives like congestion pricing, aims to expand open streets and pedestrian plazas to support local businesses, and seeks to implement trash containerization in dense, mixed-use areas. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of supporting homeless shelters and transitional housing programs while working to improve street safety in a district with high pedestrian fatalities. Looking Ahead The candidate sees City of Yes as just the beginning. Future initiatives may include mapping new R12 districts with higher density caps, expanding transit-oriented development, and exploring innovative ownership models like community land trusts. “It’s time for people to start taking these issues seriously,” Coleman asserts. “There’s a whole generation for whom housing is their top issue and biggest source of stress and anxiety. The solutions are there for the taking – we just need to be bold about it.” Search Find Top Ranked Professionals Get matched to the best real estate professionals for your needs, whether you're a home buyer, seller, investor, or business customer.

Transforming New York’s Housing Landscape The City of Yes initiative, which Coleman ardently supports, represents the most significant overhaul of New York’s zoning laws since 1961. The comprehensive package aims to create 80,000 new homes over the next decade, making it the largest affordable housing proposal in the city’s history. “The beauty of City of Yes is that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” Coleman explains. “It is carefully targeted at low, medium, and high-density districts, with different proposals for each.” The initiative includes eliminating costly parking mandates in low-density areas and introducing a 20% zoning bonus for including affordable housing in medium and high-density districts. Addressing Common Misconceptions Coleman, a Boston University Law School graduate who recently left his position as a litigator to campaign full-time, addresses a key criticism of the initiative. “The biggest myth that gets spread about this, particularly in my district, is that there’s no affordable housing component to this law,” he explains. Critics argue the law doesn’t guarantee affordable housing, but Coleman notes this stems from constitutional constraints rather than policy choice. “Unfortunately, you can’t do that (mandate affordable housing requirements) in the United States,” Coleman explains. “We have something called the due process clause and the takings clause. You can’t just take private land and tell developers ‘This is what you have to build on it.'” Instead, he describes how the law creates a pragmatic incentive structure: “What cities do instead is say, ‘Okay, we can’t make you do it, but if you want to build to the maximum capacity on this land, if you want to have the best economics for this project with tax incentives, you have to have 25% affordable housing.'” This approach, working in conjunction with new state tax incentives, is expected to create approximately 20,000 affordable units over the next decade. Impact on Real Estate Development For the real estate industry, Coleman suggests the benefits will be modest but meaningful. “Big developers, a lot of the time, can get their projects through anyway,” he notes. “This isn’t a huge boon for developers – it’s a people-driven plan.” The universal affordability preference offering a 20% bonus will make it easier for developers to participate in the 485x tax incentive program, improving project economics while ensuring community benefits. Beyond Housing: A Comprehensive Vision Coleman’s platform addresses various urban challenges beyond housing, advocating for integrated solutions as co-chair of Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee. He promotes pedestrian-friendly initiatives like congestion pricing, aims to expand open streets and pedestrian plazas to support local businesses, and seeks to implement trash containerization in dense, mixed-use areas. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of supporting homeless shelters and transitional housing programs while working to improve street safety in a district with high pedestrian fatalities. Looking Ahead The candidate sees City of Yes as just the beginning. Future initiatives may include mapping new R12 districts with higher density caps, expanding transit-oriented development, and exploring innovative ownership models like community land trusts. “It’s time for people to start taking these issues seriously,” Coleman asserts. “There’s a whole generation for whom housing is their top issue and biggest source of stress and anxiety. The solutions are there for the taking – we just need to be bold about it.” Search Find Top Ranked Professionals Get matched to the best real estate professionals for your needs, whether you're a home buyer, seller, investor, or business customer.

Skyrocketing rents are forcing families out. Traffic congestion is choking our streets. Vacant storefronts plague our neighborhoods. And while everyday people struggle, our leadership stands in the way of progress. Jess learned early that you don’t wait for change—you fight for it. His mother co-founded the Run for Knowledge to fund the P.S. 89 library, and his father helped rebuild the West Street baseball fields. They taught him that a strong community isn’t something you inherit—it’s something you build. From a young age, he carried that forward, coaching in the Little League, reporting for the Tribeca Trib and volunteering for his City Councilmember. After earning his law degree, he returned to Tribeca with his wife, Jessica, his cat, Oliver, and his Boston Terrier, Maxie, determined to fight for the neighborhood’s future. As co-chair of Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee, he stood up for congestion pricing, championed expanding pedestrian plazas and Open Streets, and was the board’s most vocal advocate of City of Yes, an overhaul of exclusionary zoning laws that cause skyrocketing rents. After Trump’s election, he also wrote for national publications about reviving progressive politics and fighting back against the right-wing legal movement. As a lawyer, he took on corporate giants, representing opioid crisis victims in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy—an experience that showed him just how much power is stacked against everyday people. Lower Manhattan needs a leader who will take on the fights that matter. For too long, politicians have stood by as rents soared, streets became gridlocked, and small businesses struggled to survive. Jess is running to change that. He’ll take on the housing crisis by reining in rents, expanding ownership opportunities, and investing in social housing. He’ll push for safer, more walkable streets and real action on climate change. The stakes are high, and Lower Manhattan can’t afford more of the same. It’s time for leadership that delivers. Why I'm Running Lower Manhattan is at a breaking point—rents are soaring, traffic is gridlocked, and public services are failing while politicians protect the status quo. Jess Coleman has spent his life here, fighting for safer streets, affordable housing, and stronger public spaces. Now, he’s taking on a system that puts powerful interests ahead of everyday people. It’s time for bold, no-nonsense leadership that delivers real results. DONATE $25 $175 $50 $250 $100 OTHER Our campaign relies on your support!
