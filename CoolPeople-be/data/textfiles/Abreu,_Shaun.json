As a former tenant rights attorney and someone who was evicted as a child, Shaun has made housing policy his number one priority. Whether you’re a tenant, homeowner, or aspiring homeowner, there’s something in our housing agenda for you. Together, we’re building a community where everyone has a foundation for their future. Shaun is a proud member of the City Council’s Housing, Land Use, and Zoning committees. Accomplishments: Building Housing for All: As a member of the City Council Zoning Committee, Shaun cast the decisive vote (4-3) for the City of Yes, the city's boldest pro-housing proposal in history. In addition to creating 80,000 housing units citywide over 15 years, we secured $5 billion to build housing, enable home ownership, and protect infrastructure like sewers, parks, and streets. Broker Fee Legislation: Shaun co-led the passage of a bill banning landlords from automatically charging renters for broker fees, easing the burden on renters searching for a new home. Now, whoever hires the broker, pays the broker. Affordable Homeownership: Shaun helped double funding for the HomeFirst Down Payment Assistance Program, increased funding for the HomeFix program, and secured resources for homeowner legal services like estate planning and small landlord support. Right to Counsel Funding Expansion: Drawing from his experience as a tenant lawyer and his own family's eviction during childhood, Shaun secured $20 million in the city budget for eviction defense, ensuring more tenants have access to legal support to stay in their homes. Housing Voucher Expansion: Shaun successfully advocated for expanded eligibility for housing vouchers, helping families transition from shelters to stable housing, even overriding a mayoral veto to prioritize community needs. Electronic Payments for Rental Assistance: Shaun passed a law to ensure rental assistance payments go directly to landlords electronically, reducing delays and preventing discrimination against voucher holders. Preserving Affordable Housing: Shaun protected nearly 1,000 units of affordable housing in the district through support for multiple Article XI tax exemptions, which dramatically improve living conditions in older buildings. Fighting Source of Income Discrimination: Shaun championed the expansion of the City Commission on Human Rights unit dedicated to combating source of income discrimination, ensuring fair treatment for all renters. What We’re Working On: Housing Where it Belongs: Shaun continues to work with city agencies and community members to identify opportunities to build housing and make housing more affordable. Elevating Tenant Voices: Shaun regularly brokers meetings between tenant associations and landlords, often with support from professional tenant advocates and legal experts, to improve their living conditions. Expanding Tenant Rights: Shaun supports a legislative package to strengthen tenant protections, including expanding harassment definitions, mandating access to air conditioning, and safeguarding tenants in buildings with unresolved code violations. Securing a Permanent Tax Break for HDFCs: Shaun is advocating for a new, permanent tax break to replace the expiring DAMP tax exemption in 2029, working with the HDFC Coalition to protect low- and middle-income homeowners while avoiding additional regulatory burdens. Advocating for Community Land Trusts: Shaun supports the Community Land Act to combat displacement by empowering community land trusts and nonprofits to purchase multifamily buildings and allocate city-owned land for permanent affordability and community benefits. BACK TO TOP Education & Youth Every child deserves a strong start and the resources to succeed. That’s why Shaun believes in an education system that lifts every student and treats our educators with the respect they deserve. Our education and youth initiatives focus on expanding quality early childhood programs, improving reading instruction, and ensuring afterschool options for kids in every neighborhood. Accomplishments: Expanding Universal 3-K: Shaun helped secure an additional $100 million in funding for Universal 3-K, ensuring every family who needs a seat has access to early childhood education. This victory came after the Council successfully fought against $514 million in proposed budget cuts to early education programs. Investing in Local Schools and Youth Programs: Shaun allocated funding to support expansive youth programming, partnering with organizations like BioBus, the Boys and Girls Club, and Brotherhood Sister Sol to provide sports, arts, and educational opportunities. He also directed capital funds toward improving school infrastructure, including gyms, libraries, technology labs, and auditoriums, to address the historic underfunding of our public schools.

BACK TO TOP Education & Youth Every child deserves a strong start and the resources to succeed. That’s why Shaun believes in an education system that lifts every student and treats our educators with the respect they deserve. Our education and youth initiatives focus on expanding quality early childhood programs, improving reading instruction, and ensuring afterschool options for kids in every neighborhood. Accomplishments: Expanding Universal 3-K: Shaun helped secure an additional $100 million in funding for Universal 3-K, ensuring every family who needs a seat has access to early childhood education. This victory came after the Council successfully fought against $514 million in proposed budget cuts to early education programs. Investing in Local Schools and Youth Programs: Shaun allocated funding to support expansive youth programming, partnering with organizations like BioBus, the Boys and Girls Club, and Brotherhood Sister Sol to provide sports, arts, and educational opportunities. He also directed capital funds toward improving school infrastructure, including gyms, libraries, technology labs, and auditoriums, to address the historic underfunding of our public schools.

Restoring the Job Training Participant Program: Shaun advocated for restoring funding to the Parks Opportunity Program, providing six-month paid job training for low-income New Yorkers while supporting park maintenance and fostering economic opportunity. Know Your Worth: To make the job search fairer for all New Yorkers, Shaun co-sponsored legislation requiring job listings to advertise the salary for the role, rather than revealing wages at the end of the interview process.

What We’re Working On: Pet Leave: Shaun is pushing for a bill to allow employees to use their paid sick leave to handle pet-related emergencies, recognizing that pets enrich our lives and supporting working pet owners. Tipping Transparency for Deliveristas: Shaun’s proposed bills would require apps to show a tipping option at checkout, ensuring customers have the option to tip if they choose and that workers aren’t shortchanged by hidden fees. Pay Transparency for Deliveristas: This bill would require delivery apps to clearly show how pay is calculated and how many hours they worked, empowering deliveristas with information to ensure they’re compensated fairly. Backing the Construction Justice Act: Shaun co-sponsored legislation mandating a $40 per hour wage and benefits for city-subsidized housing projects, promoting fair compensation and economic justice in the construction industry. Grocery & Retailer Pricing Accuracy: Shaun introduced a bill requiring stores to honor the lowest advertised price, ensuring shoppers aren’t overcharged and fostering trust between consumers and local businesses.

Protecting Commercial Waste Zones: Shaun’s bill will prevent monopolies in commercial waste zones, ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly waste management practices. BACK TO TOP Worker & Consumer Protections Everyone deserves fair treatment and transparency—whether at work, shopping for essentials, or using delivery services. Our worker and consumer protection efforts ensure New Yorkers are safe, supported, and empowered. From pioneering the first-ever height and weight anti-discrimination law to fighting for fair wages, better working conditions, and consumer rights, Shaun is building a city where everyone has access to opportunities. Accomplishments: Height and Weight Anti-Discrimination Law: Shaun championed a groundbreaking law making it illegal to discriminate based on height and weight, creating a fairer, more inclusive workplace and community.

What We’re Working On: Pet Leave: Shaun is pushing for a bill to allow employees to use their paid sick leave to handle pet-related emergencies, recognizing that pets enrich our lives and supporting working pet owners. Tipping Transparency for Deliveristas: Shaun’s proposed bills would require apps to show a tipping option at checkout, ensuring customers have the option to tip if they choose and that workers aren’t shortchanged by hidden fees. Pay Transparency for Deliveristas: This bill would require delivery apps to clearly show how pay is calculated and how many hours they worked, empowering deliveristas with information to ensure they’re compensated fairly. Backing the Construction Justice Act: Shaun co-sponsored legislation mandating a $40 per hour wage and benefits for city-subsidized housing projects, promoting fair compensation and economic justice in the construction industry. Grocery & Retailer Pricing Accuracy: Shaun introduced a bill requiring stores to honor the lowest advertised price, ensuring shoppers aren’t overcharged and fostering trust between consumers and local businesses. Protecting Non-Traditional Families in the Workplace: Shaun introduced legislation to promote inclusivity by recognizing non-traditional families, including families led by grandparents or stepparents, as an equally protected class in the workplace.

We’re bringing vital resources closer to home with initiatives like our mental health one-stop shop and transparency in hospital pricing legislation. And our focus on issues like sleep apnea, youth mental health, and gun safety awareness reflects our commitment to a city that cares for everyone. We’re working toward a New York that supports health at every age and every stage of life. Accomplishments: Expanding Psychiatric Beds: As a member of the Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addiction Committee, Shaun advocated for reopening inpatient psychiatric beds in state-licensed hospitals. So far, this effort has led to $30 million in state funding to expand psychiatric care at community-based hospitals across New York City. Sleep Apnea Testing Access: Shaun passed a bill for a city-funded program to provide free sleep apnea testing and treatment. Early detection of sleep apnea is essential to preventing severe health risks, such as heart disease and stroke, and improving safety, wellbeing, and longevity for all New Yorkers. Mental Health One-Stop Shop: Shaun’s legislation created a centralized resource for free mental health services, giving New Yorkers easy access to the support they need, regardless of income. Hospital Pricing Transparency: Shaun co-sponsored a law requiring private hospitals to disclose pricing, helping patients make informed decisions and reducing unexpected medical bills. Age In Place NYC Package: Shaun helped pass a legislative package supporting older adults with essential services like eviction protection, digital literacy programs, and expanded telehealth options to foster independence. What We’re Working On: Social Media & Youth Mental Health Awareness: In response to the impacts of social media on youth, Shaun is advocating for educational materials to help parents and students navigate challenges safely and reduce risky behaviors. Promoting Gun Safety Awareness: Shaun introduced legislation requiring schools to provide information on gun safety. This includes safe storage, gun buy-back programs, and recognizing risk factors for suicide, gun violence, and intimate partner violence. Narcan Availability in Daycare Centers: Shaun is pushing for Narcan to be stocked in daycares to address potential overdose emergencies, providing an extra layer of safety for children and staff. BACK TO TOP ON THE ISSUES Shaun's Priorities Housing Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to call home. As a former tenant rights attorney and someone who was evicted as a child, Shaun has made housing policy his number one priority.

Shaun’s childhood was shaped by challenges familiar to many New Yorkers. When he was young, his parents lost their jobs, and his family was evicted from their home. Shaun struggled in school, even repeating the 4th grade. But despite these hardships, he also saw the strength of his community. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today. With their support, he became the first in his family to graduate from college and established a career as a tenant rights attorney representing families like his own. Now, Shaun is fighting to build a stronger community in the district that he has always called home. He is raising his own family in Washington Heights and sending his stepdaughter to a public elementary school on the Upper West Side. When he isn’t helping with homework or spending time with family, he is laser focused on the issues that matter most: affordable housing, worker rights, cleaner streets, public safety, and environmental sustainability. His record proves it. As a council member, Shaun has delivered for his district and New York City. He cast the decisive vote on a plan to build 80,000 new housing units and allocate $5 billion for housing and infrastructure. He successfully restored and expanded funding for community composting, libraries, universal 3-K, and the Right to Counsel in housing court. He established and oversaw a pilot program to get trash bags off the streets in Upper Manhattan, resulting in a decrease in rat sightings of over 55%. And soon, his vision for garbage-free streets will be implemented citywide. He has brought in over $34 million for district parks, and he led the way on groundbreaking legislation to protect workers, tenants, and families. His leadership reflects his steadfast belief that government should work for the people, making our lives better in ways we can see and feel.

Shaun struggled in school, even repeating the 4th grade. But despite these hardships, he also saw the strength of his community. Neighbors provided a place to live, teachers gave him time and attention, and his parents were fortunate enough to find good jobs—his mother as a bookkeeper at Zabar’s and his father as a janitor for the Port Authority, where they both still work today.
