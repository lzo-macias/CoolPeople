About Griffin My name is Griffin Fossella, and I’m running as the “We the People” candidate in this race. As the ONLY candidate who stands with President Trump, I’m running for City Council’s 51st District because Staten Island deserves a representative who will always put them first. A Family of Public Service From my great-great-grandfather to my father, the Fossella family has always been committed to serving Staten Island. We’re not politicians seeking power—we’re community servants fighting for our neighbors and to support President Trump’s vision agenda to Make America Great Again. My Promise to Staten Island This isn’t about politics—it’s about our community. It’s about creating a Staten Island where our kids are safe, our families can thrive, and our hard-earned money stays in our pockets. Together, we can build a stronger, safer, more affordable future for every resident.
