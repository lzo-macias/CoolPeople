Abraham Maslow was a renowned New York psychologist and college professor. He developed a hierarchy of needs , which informs the values that guides the Louis Flores 2025 campaign. The political platform of this campaign is organised into categories that follow Dr. Maslow's teachings. Basic Needs Housing. The New York City Council can no longer ignore the Government's responsibility to ensure that every New York has ready access to affordable housing. The Government must also stop turning its back to civil rights violations taking place daily in and out of the City's housing court system. Because of the homelessness crisis, the Government must improve the living conditions in all homeless shelters and make it easier for the homeless to move out of the shelter system. The time has come for the Government to admit that gentrification is not a housing plan, but a displacement plan. We can and must do better. The Louis Flores 2025 campaign emerged out of the fight to save public housing from demolition and privatisation, and this campaign's platform will roll-up to ensure that all New Yorkers are housed and live free of landlord harassment in their living spaces.

The New York City Council must take the lead to ensure that citizens don't live in fear of police brutality, political oppression, and officer-committed homicide. Strategic, public assets. The New York City Council should take the lead in safeguarding strategic, public assets, like public housing and public charity hospitals, instead of selling them out to private-sector real estate developers. Without shelter, nutrition, and safety, people's lives become destabalised, preventing them from focusing on accessing their rights under the Government. Psychological Needs Healthcare. The New York City Council must take the lead in making sure that New Yorkers can access truly affordable health care. For example, New Yorkers should not be worse-off financially when they get off Medicaid after they get a private-sector job and move to private health insurance. Since the Coronavirus pandemic (\" COVID-19 \") is not over, and other pandemics are on the horizon, like the Highly-pathogenic avian influenza (\" HPAI \"), the New York City Council must step up oversight of and improve transparency around weekly variant surveillance reports. Publishing and implementing the Government responsiveness and readiness plans for responding to these pandemics is critical for keeping New Yorkers safe and healthy. Family planning. The New York City Council must take a lead to provide New Yorkers with the privacy to make all basic decisions about their relationships, including planning for their families.
