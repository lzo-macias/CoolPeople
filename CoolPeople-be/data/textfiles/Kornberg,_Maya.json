You can order your copy here: Amazon Barnes&Noble Columbia University Press Indiepubs It is widely believed that Congress has broken down. Media accounts present the storied legislature as thoroughly gridlocked, paralyzed by partisan rancor. Political scientists find that Congress is passing fewer laws and spending less time on legislative work. Which parts of a supposedly dysfunctional legislature continue to function? This book examines the legislative process beyond voting patterns, emphasizing the crucial role of congressional committee hearings. In committees, lawmakers hear from expert witnesses, legislators revise and discuss bills before bringing them to a vote, and the public has an opportunity to engage with Congress. The book scrutinizes the inner workings of committees—the different types of witnesses who testify, the varied hearings Congress holds, and the distinct effects that committee work has on Congresspeople. It deploys original mixed-methods datasets that span from insider interviews to sentiment analysis examining the language used in hearings. The book evaluates how committees operate and the conditions affecting their performance, finding that committee work can be more deliberative and productive than the politics of the Congress floor. Through a comprehensive exploration of who committees hear from and how they listen, this book demonstrates that Congress is not as dysfunctional as is often claimed. Inside Congressional Committees also suggests timely reforms based on these findings that can strengthen Congress. Reviews “Maya L. Kornberg has produced a rich, informative, and beautifully written study of the internal operations of the contemporary Congress. Inside Congressional Committees is a refreshingly balanced perspective, one that offers a nuanced understanding of Congress’s strengths, weaknesses, and complex institutional realities.” Frances E. Lee, Princeton University “This creative and impressive book shines a welcome light on the political underbelly of committees in the U.S. Congress. Marshalling a remarkable array of evidence, Kornberg pinpoints the roles of norms and relationships in sustaining committees as arenas of bipartisan problem solving. She advances a nuanced, clear-eyed view of the potential and pitfalls of today’s committees.” Sarah Binder, George Washington University “Kornberg significantly increases our understanding of how congressional committee hearings are structured, who testifies at them, what those witnesses say, and what impact the hearings have. This book is a must-read for scholars of Congress.” Josh Chafetz, Georgetown University “Everyone loves to hate Congress for being dysfunctional, polarized, and weak. Kornberg’s elegant study asks us to think twice. She carefully examines how congressional committees actually channel expertise and discourse, why that matters, and where to focus any efforts to make it better.” William J.

Marshalling a remarkable array of evidence, Kornberg pinpoints the roles of norms and relationships in sustaining committees as arenas of bipartisan problem solving. She advances a nuanced, clear-eyed view of the potential and pitfalls of today’s committees.” Sarah Binder, George Washington University “Kornberg significantly increases our understanding of how congressional committee hearings are structured, who testifies at them, what those witnesses say, and what impact the hearings have. This book is a must-read for scholars of Congress.” Josh Chafetz, Georgetown University “Everyone loves to hate Congress for being dysfunctional, polarized, and weak. Kornberg’s elegant study asks us to think twice. She carefully examines how congressional committees actually channel expertise and discourse, why that matters, and where to focus any efforts to make it better.” William J. Antholis, CEO of the Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process (Columbia University Press) The book is now available for purchase online and in stores. You can order your copy here: Amazon Barnes&Noble Columbia University Press Indiepubs It is widely believed that Congress has broken down. Media accounts present the storied legislature as thoroughly gridlocked, paralyzed by partisan rancor. Political scientists find that Congress is passing fewer laws and spending less time on legislative work. Which parts of a supposedly dysfunctional legislature continue to function? This book examines the legislative process beyond voting patterns, emphasizing the crucial role of congressional committee hearings. In committees, lawmakers hear from expert witnesses, legislators revise and discuss bills before bringing them to a vote, and the public has an opportunity to engage with Congress. The book scrutinizes the inner workings of committees—the different types of witnesses who testify, the varied hearings Congress holds, and the distinct effects that committee work has on Congresspeople. It deploys original mixed-methods datasets that span from insider interviews to sentiment analysis examining the language used in hearings. The book evaluates how committees operate and the conditions affecting their performance, finding that committee work can be more deliberative and productive than the politics of the Congress floor. Through a comprehensive exploration of who committees hear from and how they listen, this book demonstrates that Congress is not as dysfunctional as is often claimed. Inside Congressional Committees also suggests timely reforms based on these findings that can strengthen Congress. Reviews “Maya L. Kornberg has produced a rich, informative, and beautifully written study of the internal operations of the contemporary Congress. Inside Congressional Committees is a refreshingly balanced perspective, one that offers a nuanced understanding of Congress’s strengths, weaknesses, and complex"

This is the topic of my book Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process (Columbia University Press, 2023.) I lead research for the elections and government program at the NYU Brennan Center for Justice. My work at the center focuses on legislative reform , i nformation and misinformation in politics, money in politics , and civic engagement. The research informs the advocacy of the center. I have also taught graduate and undergraduate politics courses on a variety of topics at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University. Over the course of my career, I have worked on democratic governance issues at non-profits, international development organizations, and think tanks, including positions at NYU’s Govlab, Public Agenda, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the UNDP. I am lead author and lead researcher of the 2022 Global Parliamentary Report: Public Engagement in the Work of Parliaments , a joint project of the United Nations Development Program and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. My commentary has appeared in the Washington Post, NPR, BBC, Scientific American, Newsweek, CSPAN, the Hill, Slate and my work has been cited in the New York Times, Bloomberg, The Saturday Evening Post, Ms. Magazine and other outlets. I hold a PhD in politics from Oxford University, an MPA from Columbia University, and a BA from Stanford University. My research, writing, teaching and public sector work focus on civic engagement and democratic governance. This is the topic of my book Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process (Columbia University Press, 2023.) I lead research for the elections and government program at the NYU Brennan Center for Justice. My work at the center focuses on legislative reform , i nformation and misinformation in politics, money in politics , and civic engagement. The research informs the advocacy of the center.
