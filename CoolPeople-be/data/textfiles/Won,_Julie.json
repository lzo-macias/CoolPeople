Fought for increased accessibility on public transit, particularly for studies to add elevators for the 7 train stations along Queens Boulevard, which are currently inaccessible to New Yorkers with walkers, wheelchairs, and strollers. ​ ​ As New York expects the implementation of congestion pricing to come soon, the city is at a crossroads as we reimagine how we allocate public space to promote mobility, equity, justice, and vibrant neighborhoods. We must expand the Fair Fares program and ensure that all low-income New Yorkers receive heavily discounted or free Metrocards. Affordable and efficient public transit is the backbone of Queens' economy and community, and Julie will fight to ensure that everyone has access to reliable transit. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Endorsements Endorsements Endorsements Join our team today Join our team today Join our team today Join our team today Sign up below to join our newsletter or volunteer to help the campaign.
